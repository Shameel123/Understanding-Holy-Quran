**Ayat 11 - 20**

## Ayat 11

- `The unbelievers say to the believers:`
  - `If there was any good in this Book, others would not have beaten us to its acceptance.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This is one of those arguments that the chiefs of the Quraish employed to beguile and mislead the common people against the Prophet (peace be upon him). They said: If the Quran were really based on the truth and Muhammad (peace be upon him) were inviting towards a right thing, the chiefs and the elders and the noblemen of the community would have been in the forefront to accept it. How could it be that a few young boys and mean slaves only should accept a reasonable thing but the distinguished men of the nation, who are wise and experienced, and who have been held as reliable by others, would reject it? This was the deceptive reasoning by which they tried to make the common people believe that there was something wrong with the new message; that is why the elders of the people were not believing it. Therefore, they also should avoid it.
- `But since they have not been guided to it, they will certainly say:`
  - `“This is an old fabrication.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, they regard themselves as a criterion of the truth and falsehood. They think that whatever (guidance) they reject must be falsehood. But accepting them since thousands of years also were devoid of wisdom and knowledge, and the whole wisdom has now become these people’s monopoly.


## Ayat 12

- `Yet before this the Book was revealed to Moses as a guide and a mercy.`
- `This Book, which confirms it, is in the Arabic tongue to warn the wrong-doers and to give good tidings to those who do good.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - To warn the wrongdoers: To warn of the evil end those who are being unjust to themselves and to the truth itself by disbelieving in Allah and serving others than Allah, and are involved because of this deviation of theirs in the evils of morals and deeds, which have filled human society with every kind of wickedness and injustice.


## Ayat 13

- `Surely those who said:`
  - `“Our Lord is Allah”`
- `and then remained steadfast shall have nothing to fear nor to grieve.`

## Ayat 14

- `They are the people of Paradise. They shall remain in it forever as a reward for their deeds.`

## Ayat 15

- `We have enjoined man to be kind to his parents.`
- `In pain did his mother bear him and in pain did she give birth to him.`
- `The carrying of the child to his weaning is a period of thirty months.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This verse tells that although the children should serve both the mother and the father, the mother’s right is greater in importance on the ground that she undergoes greater hardships for the sake of the children.
    - The same is borne out by a Hadith, which has been related with a little variation in wording in Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Daud, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Musnad Ahmad, and in Adab al- Mufrad of Imam Bukhari, to the effect that a person asked the Prophet (peace be upon him): Who has got a greater right to my service? The Prophet replied (peace be upon him): Your mother. He asked: Who after her? He replied: Your mother. He asked: Who after her? He replied: Your mother. He asked: Who after her? He replied: Your father. This Hadith precisely explains this verse, for in it also allusion has been made to the triple right of the mother: 
      - (1) His mother bore him with hardship.
      - (2) She gave him birth with hardship.
      - (3) His bearing and his weaning took thirty months.
- `And when he is grown to full maturity and reaches the age of forty, he prays:`
  - `“My Lord, dispose me that I may give thanks for the bounty that You have bestowed upon me and my parents, and dispose me that I may do righteous deeds that would please You, and also make my descendants righteous. I repent to You, and I am one of those who surrender themselves to You.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Another legal point also is derived from this verse and ( verse 14 of Surah Luqman) and( verse 233 of Surah Al- Baqarah), which was pointed out by Ali and Ibn Abbas in a law case and made Uthman change his decision. 
  - The story goes that during the caliphate of Uthman, a person married a woman from the Juhainah tribe, and just six months after the marriage she gave birth to a healthy and sound child. The man took the case before Uthman, who declared the woman to be an adulteress and ordered that she be stoned to death. On hearing this Ali immediately came to Uthman and asked: What sort of a decision have you given? He replied: She has given birth to a sound child six months after marriage. Is it not a clear proof of her being an adulteress? Ali did not agree, and recited the three above mentioned verses in their sequence.
    - In Surah Al-Baqarah Allah says: The mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years, if the fathers desire the suckling to be completed.
    - In Surah Luqman it is said: And his weaning took two years,
    - and in Surah Al-Ahqaf: And his bearing and his weaning took thirty months.
  - Now, if two years of suckling are taken away from 30 months, six months of bearing remain. This shows that the minimum period of pregnancy in which a sound child can be born is six months. Therefore, the woman who has given birth to a child six months after the marriage cannot be declared an adulteress.
  - On hearing this reasoning of Ali, Uthman admitted that he had not considered that thing at all. Then he recalled the woman and changed his decision.
  - According to another tradition, Ibn Abbas also supported the reasoning of Ali and then Uthman changed his decision. (Ibn Jarir, Ahkam al-Qur an by al-Jassas Ibn Kathir).


## Ayat 16

- `Such are those from whom We accept their best deeds and whose evil deeds We overlook.`
- `They will be among the people of Paradise in consonance with the true promise made to them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, their ranks in the Hereafter will be determined by the best deeds they would have done in the world, and their lapses and weaknesses and errors will be overlooked. It is just like a generous and appreciative master who determines the worth of his loyal and obedient servant not by the petty services that he renders but by some work of merit that he might accomplish or a feat of devotion and dedication that he might perform. He will not call his servant to account for his minor shortcomings and overlook his major services.


## Ayat 17

- `But he who says to his parents:`
  - `“Fie on you! Do you threaten me that I shall be resurrected, although myriad generations have passed away before me (and not one of them was resurrected)?”`
- `The parents beseech Allah (and say to their child):`
  - `“Woe to you, have faith. Surely Allah's promise is true.”`
- `But he says:`
  - `“All this is nothing but fables of olden times.”`

## Ayat 18

- `It is against such that Allah's sentence (of punishment) has become due.`
- `They will join the communities of humans and jinn that have preceded them.`
- `Verily all of them will court utter loss.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here, two types of the character have been placed side by side and the listeners are asked the silent question as to which of them is better. At that time both these types of character practically existed in the society, and it was not at all difficult for the people to know where they could find the first type of the character and where the second. 
  - This is the answer to this saying of the chiefs of the Quraish: If it had been any good to believe in this Book, these few youngsters and slaves would not have believed in it before they did. In the light of this answer everyone could see for himself as to what was the character of the believers and what of the unbelievers.


## Ayat 19

- `Of these all have ranks according to their deeds so that Allah may fully recompense them for their deeds.`
- `They shall not be wronged.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, neither will the good deeds and sacrifices of the good people be lost, nor the evildoers will be awarded a greater punishment than what they will actually deserve.
  - If a good man is deprived of his reward and receives a lesser reward than what is actually his due, it is injustice. Likewise, if an evildoer is not punished appropriately for his evil deeds, or receives a greater punishment than deserved, it is also injustice.


## Ayat 20

- `And on the Day when the unbelievers will be exposed to the Fire, they will be told:`
  - `“You have exhausted your share of the bounties in the life of the world, and you took your fill of enjoyments. So, degrading chastisement shall be yours on this Day for you waxed arrogant in the earth without justification and acted iniquitously.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Punishment of humiliation”, because of the arrogance that they showed. They thought they were big people and it was below their dignity to believe in the Messenger and join the poor and indigent believers. They were involved in the false pride that if the big people like them would believe in a thing which a few slaves and poor men had believed in, they would incur infamy. That is why Allah will disgrace them in the Hereafter and will destroy their pride.
