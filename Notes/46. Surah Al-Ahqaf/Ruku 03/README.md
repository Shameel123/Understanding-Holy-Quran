**Ayat 21 - 26**

## Ayat 21

- `Recount to them the story of (Hud), the brother of (the tribe of) 'Ad.`
- `Hud warned his people beside the sand-dunes �`
- `and there have been other warners before him and since his time � saying:`
  - `“Serve none but Allah. Verily I fear that the chastisement of an awesome day shall come upon you.”`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - As the chiefs of the Quraish had a false pride of their superiority and exulted in their wealth and prosperity, the story of Aad is being related to them about whom it was well known that they had been the mightiest people in Arabia.

## Ayat 22

- `They said:`
  - `“Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods?`
  - `Then, bring upon us the scourge that you threaten us with. Do so if you are truthful.”`

## Ayat 23

- `He replied:`
  - `“Allah alone knows about this.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, Allah alone knows as to when the torment will descend on you and for how long you will be granted respite.
  - `I only convey to you the Message that I have been sent with.`
  - `But I see that you are an ignorant people.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, you are taking my warning as a joke in your ignorance and are demanding the torment for fun. You have no idea of how dreadful is God’s torment and how near at hand it might have approached because of your misdeeds.

## Ayat 24

- `When they saw the scourge advancing towards their valleys, they said:`
  - `“This is a cloud that will bring much rain to us.”`
- `“By no means; it is what you had sought to hasten � a wind-storm bearing a grievous chastisement`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here, there is no indication as to who gave them this answer. However, the style shows explicitly that this was the answer they were given by the existing conditions. They thought it was a cloud which was coming to give rain to their valleys, but in reality it was a windstorm that was coming on to completely exterminate them.

## Ayat 25

- `that will destroy everything by the command of its Lord.”`
- `Thereafter nothing was left to be seen except their dwellings.`
- `Thus do We requite the wrong-doers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For the details of the story of Aad, see (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 65-72); (Surah Houd, Ayats 50-60); (Surah Al- Muminun, Ayats 31-41); (Surah Ash-Shuara, Ayats 123-140);(Surah Al-Ankabut, Ayat 40); (Surah HaMim-AsSajdah, Ayats 15-16 and the corresponding E.Ns).


## Ayat 26

- `We had established them firmly in a manner We have not established you.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you are no match for them as far as wealth, power, authority and other things are concerned: your sphere of authority is restricted to the bounds of the city of Makkah, but they had dominated a large part of the earth.
- `We had given them ears and eyes and hearts.`
- `But nothing availed them � neither their ears, nor their eyes, nor their hearts, for they denied the Signs of Allah.`
- `Then what they had mocked at encompassed them.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - An important truth has been stated in this brief sentence. **It is only the revelations of Allah which give the right knowledge and understanding of the truth and reality to man.**
  - If man has this understanding and knowledge he sees the right thing with his eyes, hears the right thing with his ears, thinks the right thing with his mind and intellect and takes the right decisions.
  - But when he refuses to believe in the revelations of Allah, he fails to see the truth in spite of the eyes, becomes deaf to every word of admonition in spite of the ears, and misuses the blessings of the mind and intellect that God has granted him, and goes on drawing wrong conclusions one after the other, so much so that he starts using all his capabilities for his own destruction.
