**Ayat 01 - 11**

## Ayat 01

- `Allah has caused the works of those who disbelieve`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Those who disbelieved: Those who refused to accept the teachings and guidance presented by Muhammad (peace be upon him).
- `and hinder people from the way of Allah to go to waste.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The verb sadd (from which saddu of the original is derived) is used both as a transitive and as an intransitive verb in Arabic.
    - Therefore, the sentence would mean “they themselves refrained from adopting Allah’s Way” as well as “they prevented others from adopting this way.” There are several ways of preventing others from adopting Allah’s Way:

## Ayat 02

- `As for those who attained to faith and did righteous works and believed in what was revealed to Muhammad`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **Although after saying alladhina amanu (those who believed) there was no need to say wa amanu bima nuzzila ala Muhammad-in (and accepted that which has been sent down to Muhammad), for belief by itself implies believing in the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and in the teachings sent down to him, yet making a separate mention of it is particularly meant to assert this.**
    - After the appointment of Muhammad (peace be upon him) to Prophethood, **a person’s belief in Allah and the Hereafter and the former Messengers and the Books cannot be beneficial until he also believes in him and the teachings brought by him**. This explanation was necessary because after the emigration, the Muslims had also to deal with those people, who recognized and accepted all the requirements of the faith but refused to acknowledge and accept the Prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
- `which indeed is the Truth from their Lord Allah has remitted their evil deeds and has set their condition right.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This has two meanings:
      - (1) That Allah wiped off from their record all those sins which they had happened to commit in the pre-Islamic days of ignorance. Now, they will not at all be held accountable for them.


## Ayat 03

- `That is because those who disbelieved followed falsehood whereas those who believed followed the Truth that came to them from their Lord.`
- `Thus does Allah set forth to people parables showing their true state.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, He makes both the parties aware of their positions. One party insists on following falsehood; therefore, Allah has brought all its endeavors to naught. And the other party has adopted obedience of the Truth; therefore, Allah has purified it of its evils and corrected its condition.

## Ayat 04

- `When you meet the unbelievers (in battle), smite their necks until you have crushed them, then bind your captives firmly; thereafter (you are entitled to) set them free, either by an act of grace, or against ransom, until the war ends. That is for you to do.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The words of this verse as well as the context in which it occurs clearly show that it was sent down after the revelation of the command for fighting and before the actual fighting began. The words, “So when you meet (in battle) those who disbelieve”, indicate that the fighting has not yet taken place and the Muslims are being instructed that when it does take place, what they should do.
- `If Allah had so willed, He would have Himself exacted retribution from them. (But He did not do so) that He may test some of you by means of others.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The words of (verse 20 )below testify that this Surah was sent down at a time when the command for fighting had already been given in (Surah Al-Hajj, Ayat 39) and (Surah Al- Baqarah, Ayat 190), and the hypocrites of Madinah and the people of the weak faith had been so upset that it seemed as if they were actually facing death.
- `As for those who are slain in the way of Allah, He shall never let their works go to waste.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Besides,( verses 67-69 of the Surah Al-Anfal )also testify that this verse had been sent down before the Battle of Badr. There it has been said:

## Ayat 05

- `He will guide them and set their condition right`

## Ayat 06

- `and will admit them to Paradise with which He has acquainted them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the profit that the martyrs falling in the way of Allah will gain. Its three grades have been stated:

## Ayat 07

- `Believers, if you aid Allah, He will come to your aid`
- `and will plant your feet firmly.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - If you help Allah: If you participate in the work of raising Allah’s Word with your life and wealth. But this has a deeper meaning too, which we have explained in (E.N. 50 of Surah Aal-Imran).

## Ayat 08

- `As to those who disbelieve, perdition lies in store for them`
- `and Allah has reduced their works to nought.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Literally, to stumble and fall down on the face.

## Ayat 09

- `That was because they were averse to what Allah had revealed;`
- `so He let their works go to waste.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, they preferred the whims, superstitions, customs and moral perversion of their former ignorance and did not like the teaching that Allah had revealed to guide them to the right way.

## Ayat 10

- `Have they not journeyed through the land to see the end of those who went before them?`
- `Allah utterly destroyed them.`
- `These unbelievers are doomed to the same end.`


## Ayat 11

- **`That is because Allah is the Protector of the believers whereas the unbelievers have none to protect them.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - **After being wounded at Uhud when the Prophet (peace be upon him) was resting in a hill pass with a few companions, Abu Sufyan shouted: We have Uzza and there is no Uzza for you. Thereupon the Prophet (peace be upon him) told his companions to respond, saying: Our Protector and helper is Allah, and you have no protector and helper at all. This reply of the Prophet (peace be upon him) was derived from this very verse.**
