**Ayat 119 - 122**

## Ayat 119

- `Believers! Have fear of Allah and stand with those that are truthful.`

## Ayat 120

- `It did not behove the people of Madinah and the bedouin Arabs around them that they should refrain from accompanying the Messenger of Allah and stay behind and prefer their own security to his.`
- `For whenever they suffer from thirst or weariness or hunger in the Way of Allah, and whenever they tread a place which enrages the unbelievers (whenever anything of this comes to pass), a good deed is recorded in their favour.`
- `Allah does not cause the work of the doers of good to go to waste.`

## Ayat 121

- **`Likewise, each amount they spend, be it small or large, and each journey they undertake, shall be recorded in their favour so that Allah may bestow upon them reward for their good deeds.`**

## Ayat 122

- `It was not necessary for the believers to go forth all together (to receive religious instruction),`
- `but why did not a party of them go forth that they may grow in religious understanding, and that they may warn their people when they return to them, so that they may avoid (erroneous attitudes)?`
