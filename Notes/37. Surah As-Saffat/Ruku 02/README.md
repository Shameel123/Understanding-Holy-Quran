**Ayat 22 - 74**

## Ayat 22

- `(Then will the command be given):`
  - `“Muster all the wrong-doers`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - “The unjust people” does not only imply those who committed injustices in the world, but as a Quranic term zalamo implies to every such person, who might have adopted the way of rebellion and disobedience against Allah.
  - `and their spouses`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The word “azwaj” in the original text might also imply their wives, who were their associates in this rebellion, and also all those people who were rebellious and disobedient like them. 
      - Moreover it may also mean that the culprits of different categories will be gathered together in separate groups.
  - `and the deities whom they used to serve`


## Ayat 23

- `apart from Allah,`
- `and direct them to the path of Hell,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “gods” here implies two kinds of the gods.


## Ayat 24

- `and detain them there;`
- `they will be called to account.`

## Ayat 25

- `How is it that you are not helping one another?`

## Ayat 26

- `Indeed, today they are surrendering themselves completely.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The first sentence will be addressed to the culprits, and the second to the common spectators, who will be watching the scene of the culprits’ departure for Hell.
  - This sentence itself tells of the general conditions at the time.
  - It tells how the haughty and stubborn culprits of the world will be moving towards Hell meekly and without showing any resistance.
  - Somewhere some kind will be seen being pushed about, and no one from among his courtiers will come forward to rescue “his majesty”.
  - Somewhere some conqueror of the world and some dictator will be moving away in humiliation and disgrace, and his brave army itself will deliver him for the punishment.
  - Somewhere some saint or some holy father will be seen being thrown into Hell, and no one of his disciples will bother to save him from disgrace.
  - Somewhere some leader will be trudging helplessly towards Hell, and those who used to glorify and applaud him in the world will turn away their eyes from him.
  - So much so that the one who was ever prepared to sacrifice everything for the beloved in the world, will feel least concerned to save him from his plight.
  - By depicting this scene Allah wants to impress how the relationships of man with man, which are based on rebellion against Allah in the world, will break in the Hereafter, and how the pride of those who are involved in arrogance and conceit here will be ruined.

## Ayat 27

- `They will then turn towards each other (and start wrangling).`

## Ayat 28

- `(The followers will say to their leaders):`
  - `“You used to come to us from the right hand.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The word yameen in Arabic is used for several meanings. It may mean use of the force, or well-wishing, or swearing of an oath. Accordingly, the verse would mean.
 
## Ayat 29

- `They will say:`
  - `“Nay, you yourselves were not the ones who would believe.`

## Ayat 30

- `We had no power over you.`
- `You were a rebellious people,`

## Ayat 31

- `and so we became deserving of the Word of our Lord that we shall be made to suffer chastisement.`

## Ayat 32

- `So we led you astray; we ourselves were strayed.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For explanation see ( E.Ns 51, 52, 53 of Surah Saba). 3

## Ayat 33

- `On that Day, they will all share the chastisement.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the followers as well as the guides, misleaders as well as the misled, all shall suffer the same torment. Neither will the followers’ excuse be heeded that they did not go astray but had been led astray, nor the guides’ excuse accepted that the people themselves were not desirous of following the right way.

## Ayat 34

- `Thus do We treat the culprits.`

## Ayat 35

- `Whenever it was said to them:`
  - `“There is no true deity apart from Allah,”`
- `they waxed proud`

## Ayat 36

- `and said:`
  - `“Shall we forsake our deities for the sake of a distracted poet?”`

## Ayat 37

- `(They say so although) he brought the Truth and confirmed the veracity of the Messengers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Confirmation of the Messengers has three meanings and all the three are implied here.

## Ayat 38

- `(They will be told):`
  - `“You shall taste the grievous chastisement.`

## Ayat 39

- `You will only be recompensed according to your deeds.”`

## Ayat 40

- `But Allah's chosen servants (shall be spared this woeful end).`

## Ayat 41

- `For them awaits a known provision,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “A provision, determined”: A provision all of whose characteristics have been made known to them, which they are sure to receive, about which they have also the full satisfaction that they will continue to receive it forever, and about which there is no apprehension that they may or may not get it at some time.


## Ayat 42

- `a variety of delicious fruits;`
- `and they shall be honoured`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In this there is also a subtle allusion to the fact that, in Paradise, **the food will be provided not to serve as food but for pleasure and delight**.
  - That is, the food there will not be meant to replenish the bodily deficiencies through diet, for no deficiency whatever will occur in the body in that eternal life, nor will man have appetite, for appetite is caused by the process of assimilation in the body, nor will the body demand food for its survival.
  - That is why the word fawakih has been used for the different kinds of food in Paradise, which contains the sense of taste and pleasure more than that of nutrition.

## Ayat 43

- `in the Gardens of Bliss.`

## Ayat 44

- `They will be seated upon couches set face to face;`

## Ayat 45

- `a cup filled with wine`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here it has not been mentioned as to who will take these cups of wine round to the dwellers of Paradise. This has been stated at other places.
    - And there will go round to them young boys, exclusively appointed for their service, who will be as lovely as well-guarded pearls. (Surah At- Toor, Ayat 24).
    - They will be attended by brisk-moving boys who will forever remain boys. If you saw them, you would think they were pearls, scattered. (Surah Ad-Dahr, Ayat 19).
    - Then, its further details are found in the traditions related by Anas and Samurah bin Jundub from the Prophet (peace be upon him), according to which: The children of the mushrikin will be attendants of the dwellers of Paradise. (Abu Daud Tayalisi, Tabarani, Bazzar).
    - Though these traditions are weak as regards their links of transmitters, there are several other Ahadith which mean that children who died young, before attaining maturity, will go to Paradise. Ahadith also show that the children whose parents are blessed with Paradise will live with them so as to be a comfort of the eyes for them.
    - This leaves behind those children whose parents will not go to Paradise. Thus, with regard to them, it seems reasonable that they will be made the attendants of the dwellers of Paradise. (For a detailed discussion of this, see Fath ul-Bari and Umdat ul-Qari: Kitab ul-Janaiz, Bab; Maqila fi-aulad il-mushrikin; Rasail-o-Masail, vol. iii, pp. 177-187).
- `from its springs,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here the word kaas (cup) only has been used and there is no mention of the wine. But in Arabic the use of kass always implies wine. The cup which contains milk or water, instead of wine, or is empty, is not called kaas. The word kaas is used for a cup only when it contains wine.
- `will be passed around to them;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it will not be the kind of wine that is extracted from rotten fruit and corn in the world, but it will flow naturally from fountains like canals. In Surah Muhammad, the same thing has been described more clearly, thus:
      - And canals will be flowing in it of wine which will be delightful for the drinkers. (verse 15).

## Ayat 46

- `white, sparkling (wine), a delight to the drinkers.`

## Ayat 47

- `There will neither be any harm in it for their body`
- `nor will it intoxicate their mind.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the wine of Paradise will be free from both the evils which are found in the wine of the world.
  - The wine of the world, first of all, afflicts man with its stink; then it embitters his taste, upsets his stomach, affects his mind and causes illusion; then it affects the liver and spoils the health generally. Then, when the intoxication is gone, it leaves behind other ill-effects on the body. Its other evil is that man gets drunk with it, talks nonsense and brawls. This is how the wine affects man’s mind and reason.
  - Man suffers both these evil effects of the wine only for the sake of delight and pleasure.
  - Allah says that the wine of Paradise will certainly afford and give full pleasure and delight, but it will be free from the kinds of the evils that go with the worldly wine.
