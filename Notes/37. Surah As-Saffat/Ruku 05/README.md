**Ayat 139 - 182**

## Ayat 139

- `And Jonah too was one of the Messengers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the third place where the Prophet Jonah (peace be upon him) has been mentioned in the Quran. Before this he has already been mentioned in Surah Younus and Surah Al-Anbiya. (For reference, please see(Surah Younus, Ayat 98 )and (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 87-88) and E.Ns thereof).

## Ayat 140

- `Call to mind when he fled to the laden ship,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The word abaqa in Arabic is used for the flight and escape of a slave from his master’s house.

## Ayat 141

- `cast lots, and was among the losers.`

## Ayat 142

- `Then a fish swallowed him,`
- `and he was blameworthy.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is what one understands from a study of these sentences:

## Ayat 143

- `Had he not been one of those who glorify Allah,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It has two meanings and both are implied:
    - (1) That the Prophet Jonah (peace be upon him) was not of the people who are heedless of God, but was of those who glorify and adore Allah constantly and perpetually.
    - (2) That when he went inside the fish, he turned to Allah alone and glorified Him. In Surah Al-Anbiya it has been said: He invoked Us from the depths of the darkness, saying: **There is no god but You: Glory be to You: I am indeed blameworthy.** (verse 87).

## Ayat 144

- `he would certainly have remained in its belly till the Day of Resurrection.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This does not mean that the fish would have lived till Resurrection and the Prophet Jonah (peace be upon him) would have remained alive in its belly till then, but that the fish’s belly would have become his grave till Resurrection. The famous commentator Qatadah has given this same meaning of this verse. (Ibn Jarir).

Tbh, I am not sure about it. The fish could have lived to the Last Day as well. Allah knows best.

## Ayat 145

- `But We threw him on a wide bare tract of land while he was ill;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, when the Prophet Jonah (peace be upon him) confessed his fault, and began to glorify Allah like a true and sincere believer, the fish spat him up on the beach by Allah’s command. The beach was a bare plain, without any vegetation on it, or anything to provide him shade, or any means of food.

## Ayat 146

- `and caused a gourd tree to grow over him,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Arabic word yaqteen applies to a tree which does not stand on a stem but grows and spreads like a creeper, e.g. a pumpkin, cucumber, water-melon, etc.
  - In any case, a creeper was produced miraculously, so that its leaves should provide shade to the Prophet Jonah and its fruit should serve him both as food and as shade.

## Ayat 147

- `and We sent him forth to a nation of a hundred thousand or more,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The mention of a hundred thousand people or more does not mean that Allah had any doubt about their number, but it means that a casual observer would have estimated the population to be more than a hundred thousand people in any case.
  - Probably it was the same place which the Prophet Jonah (peace be upon him) had left and fled. After his departure when the people of the place saw the scourge approaching, they believed. But this was only a kind of repentance which was accepted and the scourge averted. Now, the Prophet Jonah (peace be upon him) was again sent to them so that the people should believe in him as a Prophet and become Muslims formally. To understand this, one should keep in view verse 98 of Surah Younus.

## Ayat 148

- `and they believed.`
- `So We let them enjoy life for a while.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Some people have taken exception to what we have written concerning this story of the Prophet Jonah in our commentary of Surahs Younus and Al-Anbiya. It would therefore be proper that we should reproduce here the explanations given by the other commentators in this regard.

## Ayat 149

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Another theme starts from here. In the preceding theme that started from verse 11, the Quraish had been put this question: Ask them: what is more difficult: their own creation or of those things that We have created?
  - Now, they are being asked this second question.
  - The object of the first question was to warn the disbelievers of their deviation because of which they regarded life-after-death and the meting out of rewards and punishments as impossible, and therefore, mocked the Prophet (peace be upon him) for it.
  - Now they are being asked this second question to warn them of their ignorance due to which they attributed children to Allah and would join anybody with Allah in any relationship they liked on mere conjecture.


- `So ask their opinion:`
  - `“(Are you convinced) that your Lord should have daughters and you should have sons?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Traditions show that in Arabia the tribes of Quraish, Juhainah, Bani Salimah, Khuzaah, Bani Mulaih, etc. held the belief that the **angels were Allah’s daughters**.
  - This belief of their ignorance has been referred to at several places in the Quran, e.g. in(Surah An-Nisa, Ayat 117); (Surah An- Nahl, Aytas 57-58); (Surah Bani-Israil, Ayat 40);(Surah Az- Zukhruf, Ayats 16, 19); (Surah An-Najm, Ayats 21-27).

## Ayat 150

- `Did We create the angels as females the while they witnessed?”`

## Ayat 151

- `Behold, it is one of their fabrications that they say:`

## Ayat 152

- `“Allah has begotten.”`
- `They are liars!`

## Ayat 153

- `Did He choose daughters rather than sons?`

## Ayat 154

- `What is the matter with you that you make such strange judgements?`

## Ayat 155

- `Will you then not take heed?`

## Ayat 156

- `Do you have any clear authority for such claims?`

## Ayat 157

- `Bring your Book, if you are truthful.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, there can be only two bases for regarding the angels as the daughters of Allah. Either such a thing could be said on the basis of observation, or the one who asserted it should possess a divine book in which Allah Himself might have stated that the angels were His daughters.
  - Now, if those who held such belief could neither make a claim to have observed such a thing nor did they possess any divine book that might contain such a thing, there could be no greater stupidity than this that one should base his religious belief on mere conjecture, and attribute to Allah, Lord of the worlds, such things as were patently ridiculous.

## Ayat 158

- `They have established a kinship between Allah and the angels;`
- `and the angels know well that these people will be arraigned (as culprits).`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Though the **word used is al-jinnah instead of almalaikah**, some major commentators have opined that here the word jinn has been used for malaikah in its literal sense (of **hidden creation**); malaikah (angels) also are, in reality, a hidden creation, and the following theme also demands that al jinnah here be taken in the sense of al-malaikah.

Maybe there was some other sort of thing that was done when they tried to form the relation with Jinn? But I do not have any such knowledge, I just got this idea.

## Ayat 159

- `(They say):`
  - **`“Exalted be Allah above what they attribute to Him,`**

## Ayat 160

- `all of them except the chosen servants of Allah.`

## Ayat 161

- `So you and your deities`

## Ayat 162

- `shall not be able to tempt anyone away from Allah`

## Ayat 163

- `except him who shall roast in the Blazing Fire.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Another translation of this verse can be: **Therefore, you and your worship: on this you cannot tempt into mischief anyone except him**.
  - According to this second translation, the meaning would be: **O you who have gone astray, by this worship that you are performing before us, and regarding us as the children of Allah, Lord of the worlds, you cannot tempt us into mischief. By this you can only beguile a fool who might be working for his own doom. So, we refuse to fall into the trap that you have set for us**.

## Ayat 164

- `As for us, there is none but has an appointed station.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, not to speak of being Allah’s children, we do not have the power to exceed in any way or degree the place and position and status appointed for each of us by Allah.

## Ayat 165

- `Verily we range ourselves in rows (as humble servants)`

## Ayat 166

- `and we are of those who glorify Allah.”`

## Ayat 167

- `They used to say before:`

## Ayat 168

- `“If only we had the Reminder which had been granted to the people of yore`

## Ayat 169

- `we would surely have been Allah's chosen servants.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This same thing has already been mentioned in( Surah Fatir, Ayat 42).

## Ayat 170

- `But when it came to them, they rejected it.`
- `They shall soon come to know (the end of such an attitude).`

## Ayat 171

- `We have already given Our promise to Our Messengers`

## Ayat 172

- `that they shall certainly be succoured,`

## Ayat 173

- `and that Our hosts shall triumph.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Allah’s army: implies the believers who obey Allah’s Messenger and side with him. 
  - This also includes those unseen powers by which Allah helps the followers of the truth.

## Ayat 174

- `So, (O Prophet), leave them alone for a while,`

## Ayat 175

- `and see, and soon they too shall see.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, it will not take long when they will see their defeat and your victory with their own eyes.
  - This proved to be true as it had been foretold. Hardly 14 to 15 years had passed after the revelation of these vases when the pagans of Makkah witnessed the Prophet (peace be upon him) enter their city as a conqueror, and then a few years later the same people saw that Islam had overwhelmed not only Arabia but the mighty empires of Rome and Iran as well.

## Ayat 176

- `Do they seek to hasten Our chastisement?`

## Ayat 177

- `When that chastisement will descend upon their courtyard,`
- `evil shall that Day be for those who had been warned.`

## Ayat 178

- `Leave them alone for a while,`

## Ayat 179

- `and see; and they too shall soon see.`

## Ayat 180

- **`Exalted be your Lord, the Lord of Glory, above what they attribute to Him,`**

## Ayat 181

- **`and peace be upon the Messengers,`**

## Ayat 182

- **`and all praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe.`**
