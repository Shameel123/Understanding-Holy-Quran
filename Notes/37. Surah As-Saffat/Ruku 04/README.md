**Ayat 114 - 138**

## Ayat 114

- `Verily We bestowed Our favours on Moses and Aaron`

## Ayat 115

- `and We delivered both of them and their people from the great calamity.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “A great distress”: the distress in which they were involved at the hands of Pharaoh and his people.

## Ayat 116

- `We succoured them,`
- `and they gained the upper hand (against their enemies).`

## Ayat 117

- `We granted them a Clear Book,`

## Ayat 118

- `and showed them the Straight Way,`

## Ayat 119

- `and preserved for them a good name among posterity.`

## Ayat 120

- **`Peace be upon Moses and Aaron.`**

## Ayat 121

- **`Thus do We reward the good-doers.`**

## Ayat 122

- `Surely both of them were among Our believing servants.`

## Ayat 123

- `Surely, Elias too was among the Messengers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Prophet **Elias** (peace be upon him) was from among the Israelite Prophets. He has been mentioned only twice in the Quran, here and in Surah Al-Anaam, Ayat 85.
  - The present-day scholars have determined his period between 875 and 850 B.C. He was an inhabitant of Gilead, which in ancient days was the territory now under the northern districts of the modern state of Jordan, to the south of the River Yarmuk. In the Bible he has been mentioned as **Elijah** the **Tishbite**. Here is briefly his life story.

## Ayat 124

- `(Call to mind) when he said to his people:`
  - `“Will you not fear Allah?`

## Ayat 125

- `Do you call upon Baal and forsake the Best of the Creators?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Lexically, baal means master, chief and possessor.
  - This word was also used for husband, and has been used in this sense at several places in the Quran itself, e.g. in (Surah Al- Baqarah, Ayat 228); (Surah An-Nisa, Ayat 127); (Sura Houd, Ayat 72) and (Surah An-Noor, Ayat 31).
  - However; in the ancient times the Semetic nations used it in the meaning of deity or lord; they had even given the name of Baal to a special god. The chief male god of the Phoenicians, in particular, was Baal and their chief goddess was Ashtoreth, his wife. 
  - The scholars differ as to whether Baal meant the sun or Jupiter, and Ashtoreth the moon or Venus.
  - In any case, historically it is certain that Baal worship was prevalent from Babylon to Egypt throughout the Middle East, and the polytheistic communities of the Lebanon and Syria and Palestine, in particular, had become its devotees. When the Israelites settled in Palestine and Jordan after they came out from Egypt, they started contracting marriage and other social relations with the polytheistic nations round about them, in violation of the strict prohibitive injunctions of the Torah, the disease of idolworship began to spread among them, too.
    - According to the Bible, this moral and religious decline had started appearing among the Israelites soon after the death of Joshua, son of Nun, who was the first caliph of the Prophet Moses:

## Ayat 126

- `Allah is your Lord`
- `and the Lord of your ancestors of yore.”`

## Ayat 127

- `But they denounced him as a liar,`
- `so they will surely be arraigned (for punishment),`

## Ayat 128

- `except Allah's chosen servants.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, only those people will be made an exception from the punishment, who did not belie the Prophet Elijah (peace be upon him), and whom Allah chose from among the nation for His worship.

## Ayat 129

- `We preserved a good name for him among posterity.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The treatment that the Israelites meted out to the Prophet Elijah (peace be upon him) in his life has been referred to above, but after his death they became so enamored of him that they held him in the highest esteem and reverence after the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him).
  - They formed the belief that Elijah (peace be upon him) had been taken up alive into heaven by a whirlwind (2 Kings, ch. 2), and that he will come back to the world again. Thus, in Malachi (O.T.) it is written:

## Ayat 130

- `Peace be upon Elias.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The words in the original are: Salam-un ala El-ya-sin.
  - Some commentators say that El-ya-sin is the other name of the Prophet Elias, just as Abraham is the other name of the Prophet Ibrahim;
  - some others say that different versions of the Hebrew names were prevalent among the Arabs, e.g. one and the same angel was called Michal and Michail and Michain. The same has been the case with the name of the Prophet Elias also. In the Quran itself the same mountain has been called Toor Sina and Toor Sinin. 1

## Ayat 131

- **`Thus do We reward the good-doers.`**

## Ayat 132

- `He was one of Our believing servants.`

## Ayat 133

- `And Lot too was one of the Messengers.`

## Ayat 134

- `(Call to mind) when We delivered him and all his kinsfolk,`

## Ayat 135

- `except for an old woman who was among those that stayed behind.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This implies the wife of the Prophet Lot (peace be upon him), who did not migrate with her illustrious husband, but remained behind with her people and was punished.

## Ayat 136

- `Then We utterly destroyed the rest of them.`

## Ayat 137

- `You pass by their desolate habitations in the morning`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The reference is to the mined habitations of the people of Lot by which the Quraishite merchants passed day and night during their trade journeys to Syria and Palestine.

## Ayat 138

- `and at night. Do you still not understand?`
