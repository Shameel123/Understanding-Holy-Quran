**Ayat 09 - 24**

## Ayat 09

- `If We ever favour man with Our Mercy,`
- `and then take it away from him,`
- `he becomes utterly desperate, totally ungrateful.`

## Ayat 10

- `And if We let him taste favour after harm has touched him,`
- `he says:`
  - `'All my ills are gone',`
- `and he suddenly becomes exultant and boastful,`

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- This disgraceful characteristic of man has been mentioned here because the disbelievers were exhibiting it at that time.
- When the Prophet (peace be upon him) warned them of the consequences of their disobedience to Allah, they would scoff at him as if to say: Are you mad? Can't you see our prosperity and power? We are enjoying all the good things of life and dominating over everything and everyone all around us. How is it that you are prophesying torment for us?

## Ayat 11

- `except those who are patient`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here sabr (fortitude) also implies another meaning, that is, steadfastness, the antonym of shallowness etc. that has been mentioned in the preceding verse.
    - Those “Who are steadfast” remain fine and unwavering in their purpose in spite of the vicissitudes of life.
    - They are not influenced by the changes of circumstances but stick to the right reasonable and correct attitudes they have adopted.
    - They do not give themselves airs nor become intoxicated nor over jubilant and boastful if they win power, prosperity and name.
    - On the contrary, they are neither subdued nor depressed if they are visited by adversity.
    - In short, they come out successful in their trial by Allah, whether it be in the shape of favor or adversity and remain steadfast in both the cases.
- `and act righteously.`
- `Such shall have Allah's forgiveness and a great reward.`
