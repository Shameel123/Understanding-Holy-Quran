**Ayat 09 - 24**

## Ayat 09

- `If We ever favour man with Our Mercy,`
- `and then take it away from him,`
- `he becomes utterly desperate, totally ungrateful.`

## Ayat 10

- `And if We let him taste favour after harm has touched him,`
- `he says:`
  - `'All my ills are gone',`
- `and he suddenly becomes exultant and boastful,`

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- This disgraceful characteristic of man has been mentioned here because the disbelievers were exhibiting it at that time.
- When the Prophet (peace be upon him) warned them of the consequences of their disobedience to Allah, they would scoff at him as if to say: Are you mad? Can't you see our prosperity and power? We are enjoying all the good things of life and dominating over everything and everyone all around us. How is it that you are prophesying torment for us?

## Ayat 11

- `except those who are patient`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here sabr (fortitude) also implies another meaning, that is, steadfastness, the antonym of shallowness etc. that has been mentioned in the preceding verse.
    - Those “Who are steadfast” remain fine and unwavering in their purpose in spite of the vicissitudes of life.
    - They are not influenced by the changes of circumstances but stick to the right reasonable and correct attitudes they have adopted.
    - They do not give themselves airs nor become intoxicated nor over jubilant and boastful if they win power, prosperity and name.
    - On the contrary, they are neither subdued nor depressed if they are visited by adversity.
    - In short, they come out successful in their trial by Allah, whether it be in the shape of favor or adversity and remain steadfast in both the cases.
- `and act righteously.`
- `Such shall have Allah's forgiveness and a great reward.`

## Ayat 12

- `(O Messenger!)`
- `Let it not happen that you omit (to expound) a portion of what was revealed to you.`
- `And do not be distressed that they will say:`
  - `'Why was a treasure not bestowed upon him?'`
  - `or`
  - `'Why did no angel accompany him?'`
- `For you are merely a warner, whereas Allah has control over everything.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this verse, Allah has comforted and urged His Messenger (peace be upon him) to propagate the message without the least hesitation and not to waver in his determination for fear of ridicule or for lack of response from his people. He should convey the message in its entirety and leave the result to Allah for He has full power over everything. In order to grasp its full significance, we should keep in view the circumstances that necessitated it.

## Ayat 13

- `Do they say:`
  - `'He has invented this Book himself?'`
- `Say:`
  - `'If that is so, bring ten surahs the like of it of your composition, and call upon all (the deities) you can other than Allah to your help. Do so if you are truthful.'`

## Ayat 14

- `Then if (your deities) do not respond to your call for help then feel assured that this Book was revealed with the knowledge of Allah, and that there is no true god but Him.`
- `Will you, then, surrender (to this truth)?`

## Ayat 15

- `Those who seek merely the present world and its adornment.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This general statement has been made in continuation of the theme of the preceding verses, to refute the false excuses of the disbelievers mentioned therein for rejecting the message of the Quran.
    - This verse says that in general those people who rejected the Quran then (and are rejecting it now) were the worshipers of this world and its pleasures. As the root cause of their rejection was (and is) this false creed that there is nothing more valuable than the pleasures of this world and its material gains. And there should be no restrictions, like the ones imposed in the Quran, on their acquisition. They first made this choice, and afterwards invented arguments, like the ones mentioned in the Quran, to deceive their own minds and those of others.
- `We fully recompense them for their work in this world,`
- `and they are made to suffer no diminution in it concerning what is their due.`

## Ayat 16

- `They are the ones who shall have nothing in the Hereafter except Fire.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is a clear and stern warning to the worshipers of the world.
    - They should know that they will get the full reward for the exertions (whatever they be) they put forth in order to acquire the worldly gains but they should note it well that they would get nothing in the next world.
    - As they confined their efforts to the benefits of this world, and did nothing to earn the benefits of the next world, they should expect nothing for the deeds they have done for the material gains of this world.
    - In order to illustrate this, let us take the case of a person who desires to build a palace for himself in this world and adopts all those devices, measures and means which help build such a palace. Most surely, he will succeed in building a grand palace, for no brick will refuse to stick to its place simply because he was an unbeliever. But it is equally obvious that he shall have to leave behind in this world that grand palace along with all its furnishings as soon as he breathes his last breath.
    - For there is no reason why the palace he had built (or done anything else) for this world, should be credited to him in the next world, if he had done nothing to provide himself with a palace in the next world. For only those who provide for themselves with the necessary material for a palace in the next world in accordance with the divine law, deserve to get a palace there.
- `(There they shall come to know) that their deeds in the world have come to naught;`
- `and that whatever they have done is absolutely useless.`
  
## Ayat 17

- `Can it happen that he who takes his stand on a clear evidence from his Lord,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This shows that even apart from revelation, there is ample evidence in man’s own self, in the structure of the heavens and the earth, and in the order that prevails in the universe to prove that God is the only creator, master, lord and sovereign of the universe.
    - The evidence referred to above also inclines man to believe that the present life will be followed by another one in which man will be required to render an account of his deeds and wherein he might be requited.
- `subsequently followed by a witness from Him (in his support),`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **The “witness from Him” is the Quran.**
    - The testimony of the natural phenomena combined with that provided by man’s own self had already created in man the disposition to affirm the truths mentioned earlier.
    - All that was further reinforced by the Quran which came as reassurance that what he was predisposed to believe in was indeed true.
- `and prior to that the Book of Moses was revealed as a guide and a mercy, (would even he deny the truth in the manner of those who adore the life of this world)?`
- `Rather, such men are bound to believe in it.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In the present context the verse means that those who are overly infatuated with the allurements of a worldly life will be inclined to reject the message of the Quran.
    - Distinguishable from these are those who take full note of the testimony furnished by their own beings and by the structure and order prevailing in the universe in support of God’s unity.
    - This testimony was further reinforced by the heavenly books revealed before the Quran.
    - How could such persons close their eyes to such overwhelming testimony as this and join their voice with those of the unbelievers?
- `The Fire shall be the promised resort of the groups that disbelieve.`
- `So be in no doubt about it for this indeed is the truth from your Lord although most people do not believe.`
