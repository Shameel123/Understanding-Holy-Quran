**Ayat 61 - 68**

## Ayat 61

- `And to Thamud We sent their brother Sali'h.`
- `He said:`
  - `'My people!`
  - `Serve Allah;`
  - `you have no god other than Him.`
  - `He brought you into being out of the earth, and has made you dwell in it.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This is the proof of the claim: “You have no other Deity than Allah”.
      - The argument is based on the fact which the mushriks themselves acknowledged that it is Allah Who is their Creator. Therefore Prophet Salih (peace be upon him) argued like this: You yourselves acknowledge that it is Allah Who has created your wonderful human body out of the lifeless particles of the earth and that it is Allah Who has made the earth a suitable place for you to live. How can then there be any Deity other than Allah Who may be worthy of Godhead, service and worship?
  - `So ask Him to forgive you,`
  - `and do turn towards Him in repentance.`
  - `Indeed My Lord is near, responsive to prayers .`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - In this concise sentence, the Quran has refuted a grave misunderstanding of the mushriks, which has in every age misled people into wrong creeds.
      - They presumed that Allah lived far away from them and, therefore, was unapproachable like their own rulers on the earth.
      - As the only way of approach to them was an intercessor who alone could receive and present their requests and applications to their rulers, and convey their answers to them, they presumed that there should be some intercessor to help approach Allah and bring to them the answers to their prayers. Obviously this is a false presumption, which has been endorsed and encouraged by clever people that Allah is out of the reach of common people and it is not possible for them to reach Him and present their prayers and get their answers.
      - So they should search for such sacred beings as may have an approach to Him. 
      - Accordingly, they tried to secure the services of those who were well versed in the art of conveying the requests with the necessary presents and gifts to the Highest Authority.
      - This misunderstanding created hosts of intercessors, and the establishment of the system of priesthood, which has so incapacitated the followers of mushrik creeds of ignorance that they cannot perform by themselves any religious ceremony from birth to death.

## Ayat 62

- `They said:`
  - `'O Salih!`
  - `Until now you were one of those among us on whom we placed great hopes.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, we had expected that by your wisdom, intelligence, foresight, serious behavior and dignified personality, you would become a great and prosperous man. 
      - So we had looked forward to the great success you would achieve and to the manifold advantages we would gain over other clans and tribes because of you.
      - But you have brought to naught all of our hopes by adopting the way based on Tauhid and the Hereafter which is bound to lead us to utter ruin.
  - `Now, would you forbid us to worship what our forefathers were wont to worship?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - It may be noted here that the people of Muhammad (peace be upon him) have had the same great expectations of him.
      - They, too, had a very high opinion of his abilities and capabilities before his appointment as a Prophet. For they expected that he would become a great leader, and his foresight would bring innumerable benefits to them also. But when, contrary to their expectations, he began to invite them to the doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter, and preach the principles of high morality, they lost not only all hope in him, but began to entertain and express quite the reverse views.
      - They said: What a pity, this man who was quite good till now has, under the influence of some charm, not only ruined his own career but has destroyed all of our hopes as well.
  - `Indeed we are in disquieting doubt about what you are calling us to.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That was their argument for the worship of their gods.
      - They said that they would worship them because their forefathers worshiped them. 
      - Prophet Salih (peace be upon him), argued like this: Worship Allah....Who has created you from the earth, and Who made it a living place for you.
      - In answer to this they argued, as if to say: These deities are also worthy of worship, and we will not give them up because our forefathers have been worshiping them for a long time.
      - This is an apt example of the type of arguments employed by the supporters of Islam and those of ignorance. The former base their arguments on sound reasoning, while the latter base them on blind imitation.

## Ayat 63

- `Salih said:`
  - `'My people!`
  - `What do you think?`
  - `If I had a clear evidence from my Lord, and then He also bestowed His mercy upon me, who will rescue me from the punishment of Allah if I still disobey Him?`
  - `You can only make me lose even more.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the answer to the preceding question: If I disobey Allah by discarding the guidance I have received from Him in order to please you, you cannot defend me against Him. You will rather add to the intensity of my guilt of disobedience to Him.
  - Thus I shall incur additional punishment from Him for misleading you instead of showing the right way for which I had been sent to you.

## Ayat 64

- `My people!`
- `This she-camel of Allah is a sign for you.`
- `So let her pasture on Allah's earth, and do not hurt her or else some chastisement - which is near at hand -should overtake you.'`

## Ayat 65

 - `But they slaughtered her.`
 - `Thereupon Salih warned them: 'Enjoy yourselves in your homes for a maximum of three days. This is a promise which shall not be belied.'`

## Ayat 66

- `Then, when Our command came to pass, We saved Salih and those who shared his faith through Our special mercy, from the disgrace of that day.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - According to the traditions that are current in the Sinai Peninsula, Allah delivered them from the torment and led them there.
    - There is a Mount near Jabal-i-Musa, known by the name of Prophet Salih where, it is said, the Prophet took refuge after the destruction of his people.
- `Truly Your Lord is All-Strong, All-Mighty.`

## Ayat 67

- `And the Blast overtook those who were wont to do wrong, and then they lay lifeless in their homes`

## Ayat 68

- `as though they had never lived there before.`
- `Oh, verily the Thamud denied their Lord! Oh, the Thamud were destroyed.`
