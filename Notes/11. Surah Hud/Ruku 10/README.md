**Ayat 110 - 123**

## Ayat 110

- `And We certainly gave Moses the Book before, and there arose disagreements about it (even as there are disagreements now about the Book revealed to you).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It means this: There is nothing new in the different opinions expressed by different people regarding the Quran. They behaved in the same manner towards the Book that was given to Prophet Moses (peace be upon him). Therefore, O Muhammad (peace be upon him), do not be disheartened by their rejection of the Quran, though its teachings are simple and plain.
- `Had it not been for a decree that had already gone forth from your Lord, the matter would have long been decided between them.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is to reassure the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the believers that they should patiently wait for the consequences of the misbehavior of the unbelievers towards the Quran. But this will happen in due course as previously ordained by Allah, for Allah does not make haste in passing judgment, though the people demand haste.
- `Indeed they are in a disquieting doubt about it.`

## Ayat 111

- `Surely your Lord will recompense all to the full for their deeds.`
- `For indeed He is well aware of all what they do.`

## Ayat 112

- `So remain, (O Muhammad), you and those who have returned with you (to the fold of faith and obedience from unbelief and rebellion) steadfast (in adhering to the straight way) as you were commanded.`
- `And do not exceed the limits of (service to Allah).`
- `For certainly He is aware of all what you do.`

## Ayat 113

- `And do not incline towards the wrong-doers lest the Fire might seize you and you will have none as your protector against Allah;`
- `and then you will not be helped from anywhere.`

## Ayat 114

- `And establish the Prayer at the two ends of the day and in the first hours of the night.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This was to urge Salat at three times, that is, morning, evening and Isha. This shows that this was revealed before Salat had been made obligatory five times a day during the Miraj
- `Indeed the good deeds drive away the evil deeds.`
- `This is a Reminder to those who are mindful of Allah.`
  - Tafhim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the remedy for eradicating evil from the world:
      - Do good deeds and defeat evil with them.
    - The best way of making you virtuous is to establish salat, which will remind you of Allah over and over again: which will produce those good characteristics in you that shall help you fight successfully against the systematic and united front of evil that has been formed against the mission of the truth. This will also enable you to establish practically the system of virtue and reform.
      - (For explanation see (E.Ns 77-79 of Surah Al-Ankaboot)).

## Ayat 115

- `And be patient;`
- `for indeed Allah never lets the reward of those who do good go to waste.`

## Ayat 116

- `Why were there not, out of the generations that passed away before you, righteous men who would forbid others from causing corruption on the earth?`
- `And if such were there, they were only a few whom We had saved from those generations,`
- `or else the wrong-doers kept pursuing the ease and comfort which had been conferred upon them,`
- `thus losing themselves in sinfulness.`


## Ayat 117

- `And your Lord is not such as would wrongfully destroy human habitations while their inhabitants are righteous.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In this passage, the real cause of the fall of the communities mentioned in( Ayats 25-99 )has been pointed out in a very instructive manner.
  - In reviewing their history Allah declares that the cause of the downfall of not only these but of all the former communities was this:
    - When Allah bestowed His favors on them, they abused these favors and were so intoxicated with their own prosperity that they began to make mischief in the land. 
    - By and by, their collective conscience became so corrupt that no righteous persons were left among them to forbid evil and, if a few were left, their voice was so weak that they could not prevent them from causing mischief.
    - As a result of this, evil became so strong and prevalent among them as to warrant the scourge of Allah.
    - Otherwise Allah bears no enmity against His servants that He should destroy them without any just cause, while they were performing righteous works. This has been mentioned here for impressing the following three things.

## Ayat 118

- `Had your Lord so willed, He would surely have made mankind one community.`
- `But as things stand, now they will not cease to differ among themselves and to follow erroneous ways`

## Ayat 119

- `except for those on whom your Lord has mercy.`
- `And it is for this (exercise of freedom of choice) that He has created them.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the answer to the objection raised in the name of taqdir (destiny) against the principle that has been laid down in the preceding verse for the destruction of the wicked communities.
    - It is this:
      - Why should these communities be punished for lack of a sufficient number of righteous persons in them?
      - Why didn’t Allah Himself will to produce that sufficient number of righteous persons in it?
      - Allah has answered this objection, so as to say:
        - It is not the will of Allah to bind mankind inherently to a fixed course of life as He has bound the vegetable and animal life.
        - Had it been so, there would have been no need of sending the Messengers and the Books for inviting mankind to the faith.
        - For, in that case all human beings would have been born Muslims and born believers and there would have been no unbelief and no disobedience.
        - But it is the will of Allah to grant freedom of choice and action to man so that he may be free to choose and follow any way of life.
        - That is why He has left open both the way to Paradise and the way to Hell for man and given every individual and every community the opportunity to choose and follow either of the two ways with full freedom and win any of the two abodes as a result of his own efforts and exertions.
        - It is obvious that this scheme of Allah demands that it should be based on the freedom of choice and the option to adopt faith or unbelief.
        - This is why Allah does not compel a community to the right way if it itself intends to follow the wrong way, and plans and works for it. Allah’s scheme does not interfere with the plans and works of such a community.
        - When it makes deliberate arrangements to mold the wicked, unjust, and sinful people, He does not supply it with righteous persons by birth to set it right. 
        - Every community is free to produce good or bad people as it wills.
        - And if a community wills to follow a wrong way as a community, leaving little room for the production and the development of the righteous people in order to raise up the standard of virtue, God does not will to coerce it to follow the righteous way.
        - He will let it follow the way it chooses for itself with its inevitable consequences.
        - On the contrary, Allah shows His mercy to that community which produces a sufficiently large number of such people as accept the invitation to virtue, and leaves room in its collective system for such people to work for its reform and purification.
          - (For further explanation, See (E.N. 24 of Surah Al-Anaam).
- `And the word of your Lord was fulfilled:`
  - `'Indeed I will fill the Hell, with men and jinn, altogether.'`

## Ayat 120

- `(O Muhammad!)`
- `We narrate these anecdotes of Messengers to you that We may strengthen through them your heart.`
- `In these anecdotes come to you the truth, and an exhortation, and a reminder for the believers.`

## Ayat 121

- `As for those who are bent on not believing, tell them:`
  - `'Work according to your way and we are working according to our way.`

## Ayat 122

- `And do wait for the end of things;`
- `we too are waiting.`

## Ayat 123

- `All that is hidden in the heavens and the earth lies within the power of Allah.`
- `To Him are all matters referred for judgement.`
- `So do serve Him,`
- `and place in Him all your trust.`
- `Your Lord is not heedless of what you do.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - At the end of the discourse, Allah has warned the champions of kufr, and comforted the believers, so as to say:
    - Allah is closely watching the behaviors of both the parties in the conflict between kufr and Islam, and the Sovereign is fully aware of all that is happening in His kingdom.
    - He is watching and controlling everything with perfect wisdom.
    - He will reward richly the champions of the truth and will not let go waste their efforts and exertions. And though He is showing tolerance to the champions of kufr, and giving them respite, He will take them to task because they are unjustly persecuting the standard bearers of the truth and are spreading chaos in the land, and exerting their utmost to put obstacles in the way of the work of reform.
    - All these things are in the knowledge of Allah and the evil doers shall have to bear the consequences of their misdeeds, and the true believers will ultimately come out successful.
