**Ayat 01 - 08**

## Ayat 01

- `Alif. Lam. Ra.`
- `This is a Divine Command`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Arabic word kitab has been translated into Book because of the context.
    - For its meaning is not confined to book or something written but it includes command and sovereign decree as well and has been used in several places in the Quran in the same sense.
- `whose contents have been made firm and set forth in detail`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The contents of this Book are firm, strong, and unchangeable: they are well balanced and measured. There is no tinge of verbosity, pedantry, volubility, poetic fancy and rhetorical exaggeration. The truth has been stated accurately, and there is nothing more and nothing less than the truth. Moreover, the contents have been given in detail and everything has been made so clear and plain that there is neither confusion nor complication nor ambiguity in it.
- `from One Who is All-Wise, All-Aware`

## Ayat 02

- `that you may worship none but Allah.`
- `Verily, I have come to you as a warner and a bearer of good news from Him`

## Ayat 03

- `that you may seek forgiveness of your Lord`
- `and turn to Him in repentance`
- `whereupon He will grant you a fair enjoyment of life until an appointed term,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The assurance that “He will let you enjoy a fair provision for a term appointed” has been given to remove the misunderstanding which Satan has imbued in the heart of every foolish worshiper of the world that piety ruins one’s worldly life, though it might lead to one’s success in the Hereafter.
  - **Allah has reassured the true believers that He will shower His blessings on God fearing people and they will live happy and peaceful lives and will be honored and respected everywhere.**
  - The same thing has been stated in a different manner in(Surah An-Nahal, Ayat 97): “Whoso will do good deeds, whether a man or a woman, provided the one is a believer, We will surely make such a one lead a pure and clean life in this world.”
  - Allah has refuted this theory of Satan and his disciples that piety inevitably brings poverty, distress and affliction and ignominy to the person who adopts truth, righteousness and virtue.
  - He has assured that He will make the life of the one who will believe in Him and adopt a righteous life truly successful both in this world and in the Hereafter.
  - And it is common experience that only those people enjoy real peace of mind and are honored and respected who are God fearing and possess a pure character, who are fair and generous in all their affairs and dealings and who are free from evil.
  - For they are trusted by all and none fears any wrong or wickedness from them.
- `and will bestow favour on everyone who merits favour.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - According to the Quran, the provisions of life are either **mataul-hasana** meaning good provisions or **mataul-ghuroor** meaning deceptive provisions.
    - Here those, who return to Allah, have been assured that they will be given good provisions of life and not deceptive ones. The provisions are good if their recipient becomes even more grateful to Allah than before and uses these for fulfilling His rights and the rights of mankind and of his own self.
    - Such good provisions make his life truly successful in this world and also in the next world. On the contrary, the provisions are deceptive, if they become a temptation for the recipient, and get him involved in the worship of the things of this world more than before. Though the deceptive provisions might appear to be a blessing and a favor, these are, in fact, a curse and means of some future torment.
- `But should you turn away (from the truth), I fear for you the chastisement of an Awesome Day.`

## Ayat 04

- `Unto Allah is your return,`
- `and He has power to do everything.`

## Ayat 05

- `Lo!`
- `They fold up their breasts that they may conceal themselves from Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - They were those people of Makkah, who though not very active in their antagonism against the message of the Prophet (peace be upon him), nevertheless were very averse to it.
    - Therefore they did not like to hear it nor come face to face with him, and did their very best to avoid him.
    - If, by chance, they found him sitting somewhere and talking to the people, they would at once turn back on their heels.
    - Or if they saw him coming towards them, they would slink away or hide their faces with cloth for fear that he might address them and convey his message to them.
    - As they did not have the courage to face the truth, they would bury their heads ostrich-like and make believe that the reality from which they were hiding had disappeared, whereas it was all along there and watching their ridiculous attempts to hide from it.
- `Surely when they cover themselves up with their garments Allah knows well what they cover and what they reveal.`
- `Indeed He even knows the secrets hidden in the breasts.`

## Ayat 06

- **`There is not a single moving creature on the earth but Allah is responsible for providing its sustenance.`**
- `He knows where it dwells and where it will permanently rest.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it is foolish on your part to deceive yourselves that you can escape punishment by hiding yourselves from Allah Who has full and perfect knowledge of everything. Who knows the nest where the tiniest sparrow lives and the hole where the smallest insect resides, and provides their sustenance to them wherever they be.
    - Who knows the dwelling place and the final resting place of every creature and gives life and death to them at the appointed time.
    - Do you think that by hiding yourselves from His messenger, you can also hide yourselves from the All-Knowing Sovereign Who has sent him?
    - Do you think that Allah does not see His messenger doing his very best to convey His message to you and you are trying to turn a deaf ear to it?
- **`All this is recorded in a clear Book.`**

## Ayat 07

- `And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days - and [before that] His Throne was upon the water`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is a parenthetical clause that has probably been inserted in answer to a question, which has not been cited: if the heavens and the earth were created afterwards in six days, what was there before their creation?
    - The answer is: then there was water. It is not possible for us to say what exactly was the nature of that water. It might have been the common fluid known by that name. Or perhaps, the word water has been used as a symbol for the fluid state of the matter before it was changed to its present form. As regards to “His Throne was upon the water” I am of the opinion that it means: “His Kingdom was over water.”
- `that He may test you, who of you is better in conduct`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This enunciates the purpose of the creation: Allah created the heavens and the earth for the sake of the creation of mankind and He created mankind to test human beings by delegating to them the powers of vicegerency and making them morally responsible for using or abusing them, just as they liked.
    - Thus it has been emphasized that the sole purpose of the creation is the moral trial of man and his consequent accountability to the Creator for the use or abuse of the delegated powers, and the award of rewards and punishments.
    - For without this basic purpose, the whole work of creation would have become meaningless and useless.
- `If you were to say (O Muhammad):`
  - `'All of you will surely be raised after death',`
- `then those who disbelieve will certainly say:`
  - `'This is nothing but plain sorcery.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, the disbelievers very foolishly considered the purpose of the creation to be no more than a pastime in which they themselves were mere playthings.
      - They were so absorbed in their foolish conception that when the Prophet (peace be upon him) told them what the real purpose of creation was and what part they were required to play in it, they would scoff at him, saying: Your message is like a piece of sorcery and beyond our understanding.

## Ayat 08

- `And were We to put off the chastisement from them for a determined period, they will cry out:`
  - `'What withholds Him from chastising?'`
- `Surely when the day of the chastisement will come, nothing will avert it and the chastisement which they had ridiculed shall encompass them.`
