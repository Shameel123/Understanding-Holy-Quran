**Ayat 50 - 60**

## Ayat 50

- `And to 'Ad We sent their brother Hud.`
- `He said:`
  - `'My people!`
  - `Serve Allah:`
  - `you have no god save Him.`
  - `(In attributing partners to Allah) you have merely been fabricating lies.`

## Ayat 51

- `My people!`
- `I seek no reward from you for my work.`
- `My reward lies only with Him Who created me.`
- `Do you not understand anything?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This concise sentence contains a very strong argument:
    - The fact that you are taking a superficial view of my Message and rejecting it without paying due and deep consideration to it is a clear proof that you are not using your common sense.
    - Had you tried to understand the matter, you would have found much material for your consideration. You would have noticed that I have absolutely no personal interests: nay, I am suffering hardships, in conveying the message which cannot bring any benefit to me or to the members of my family.
    - This is a conclusive proof that my faith has very sound bases which are strong enough to enable me to forsake all the worldly joys and comforts and encounter the enmity of the whole world by waging a war against the centuries old, established rites, customs and ways of life. Do these things not demand a deep and serious consideration? Why donâ€™t you then use your common sense before rejecting the message outright?


## Ayat 52

- `My people!`
- `Ask your Lord for forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance.`
- `He will shower abundant rains upon you from the heaven, and will add strength to your strength.`
- `Do not turn away as those given to guilt.'`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the same thing that has been stated by the tounge of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in (Ayat 3).
  - This is a clear proof that moral values count not only in the life of the Hereafter but also determine the rise and fall of nations in this world.
  - This is because Allah rules over the world in accordance with moral principles and not on the basis of His physical laws alone. 
  - That is why Allah has declared in many places in the Quran that the fate of a community hangs on the message which He sends to it through His Prophet. If it accepts the message, He opens the gates of His favors and blessings for it, but if it rejects the message, then it is destroyed.

## Ayat 53

- `They said:`
- `'O Hud!`
- `You have not brought to us any clear evidence,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you have not brought a clear sign as evidence to prove conclusively to us that you have been sent by Allah and that the message you are presenting before us is the truth.
- `and we are not going to forsake our gods merely because you say so.`
- `We are not going to believe you.`

## Ayat 54

- `All we can say is that some god of ours has afflicted you with evil.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it appears that you had behaved rudely towards a god or goddess or saint: Consequently you have been smitten with madness and are being abused, dishonored and pelted with stones in the same streets in which you were respected and honored before this.
- `Hud said:`
  - `'Indeed I take Allah as my witness,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This was the refutation of their charge that he had not brought any clear evidence to them.
      - It implied: You say that I have brought no evidence to prove that I have been sent by Allah who is a standing witness everywhere in His universe and giving evidence with the phenomena of nature to show that the truth I have stated before you is absolutely correct. This also proves conclusively that there is no sign of truth in what you falsely ascribe to your gods.
  - `and you too to be my witnesses that I have nothing to do with your associating with Allah`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This is the answer of Prophet Houd (peace be upon him) to their assertion: We are not going to give up our gods at your word. (Ayat 53). His reply implied: Note it well that I, too, feel a strong disgust at the gods you have set up beside Allah.


## Ayat 55

- `others than Him in His divinity.`
- `So conspire against me,`
- `all of you,`
- `and give me no respite.`

## Ayat 56

- `I have put my trust in Allah, Who is my Lord and your Lord.`
- `There is no moving creature which He does not hold by its forelock.`
- `Surely, My Lord is on the straight path.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, whatever my Lord does is always right and correct for all His ways are straight and just, and the judgments He passes are based entirely on truth and justice. Therefore you cannot come out successful in your conflict with me: for you have deviated from the right way and are committing wicked deeds, while I am on the right way.

## Ayat 57

- `If you, then, turn away (from the truth), know that I have delivered the message with which I was sent to you.`
- `Now my Lord will set up another people in place of you and you shall in no way be able to harm Him.`
- `Surely my Lord keeps a watch over everything.'` 

## Ayat 58

- `And when Our com-mand came to pass, We delivered Hud, together with those who shared his faith, out of special mercy from Us.`
- `We delivered them from a woeful chastisement.`

## Ayat 59

- `Such were 'Ad.`
- `They repudiated the signs of their Lord,`
- `disobeyed His Messengers,`
- `and followed the bidding of every tyrannical enemy of the truth.`

## Ayat 60

- `They were pursued by a curse in this world, and so will they be on the Day of Judgement .`
- `Lo! 'Ad disbelieved in the Lord. Lo! ruined are 'Ad, the people of Hud.`
