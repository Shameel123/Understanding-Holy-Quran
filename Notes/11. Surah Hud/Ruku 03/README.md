**Ayat 25 - 35**

## Ayat 25

- `(Such were the circumstances)`
- `when We sent forth Noah to his people.`
- `(He said):`
  - `'I have been sent to you to warn you plainly`

## Ayat 26

- `that you may worship none but Allah or else I fear for you the chastisement of a Grievous Day.`

## Ayat 27

- `The notables among Noah's own people, who had refused to follow him, responded:`
  - `'We merely consider you a human being like ourselves.`
  - `Nor do we find among those who follow you except the lowliest of our folk, the men who follow you without any proper reason.`
  - `We see nothing in you to suggest that you are any better than us.`
  - `Rather, we believe you to be liars.'`

## Ayat 28

- `Noah said:`
  - `'My people!`
  - `If I base myself on a clear evidence from my Lord,`
  - `and I have also been blessed by His mercy`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This is the same thing that has been put into the mouth of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in( Ayat 17). That is, At first I recognized the reality of Tauhid by observing keenly the signs of God in the universe and in my own self. Then the same was confirmed by revelation to me.
      - This shows that all the Prophets acquired the knowledge of the Unseen by observation and contemplation. Then Allah blessed them with the actual knowledge of the same at the time of their appointment as Prophets
  - `to which you have been blind,`
  - `how can we force it upon you despite your aversion to it?`


## Ayat 29

- `My people!`
- `I seek no recompense from you.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This was to bring home to them the fact that he had no selfish motive in the performance of his mission, as if to say: I am conveying the admonition to you without any demand or hope or expectation of worldly gains. Nay, I am bearing all the sufferings in the hope that you may at last realize that I have no axe to grind. And you cannot point out anything to show that I have any personal or selfish interest before me in the mission of the Message. See.(E.N. 70 of Surah Al-Mominoon),(E.N. 17 of Surah Saba vand(E.N. 41 of Surah Ash-Shura).
- `My recompense is only with Allah.`
- `Nor will I drive away those who believe.`
- `They are destined to meet their Lord.`
- `But I find you to be an ignorant people.`

## Ayat 30

- `My people!`
- `Were I to drive the men of faith away,`
- `who will protect me from (the chastisement of) Allah?`
- `Do you not understand even this much?`

## Ayat 31

- `I do not say to you that I possess Allah's treasures,`
- `nor that I have access to the realm beyond the ken of sense-perception,`
- `nor do I claim to be an angel.`
- `Nor do I say regarding those whom you look upon with disdain that Allah will not bestow any good upon them.`
- `Allah knows best what is in their hearts.`
- `Were I to say so I would be one of the wrongdoers.'`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the answer to their objection that he was no more than a man like themselves.
  - Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) admitted this: In fact I am a man and I never claimed to be more than this.
  - My only claim is that God has shown me the right way of knowledge and action and you are welcome to test this in any way you like. But instead of this, you are asking me questions about the Unseen, though I never claimed to have its knowledge. You ask me to produce such things as can be produced only by that person who possesses Godâ€™s treasures and I never claimed to possess them.
  - You object that my physical life is like that of other men, though I never claimed that I was an angel and not a man.
  - The true test of my claim is that you should ask me about the true creeds, the principles of morality and culture and not about frivolous things about the future events for I never claimed to possess their knowledge. 

## Ayat 32

- `They said:`
  - `'O Noah!`
  - `Surely you have disputed with us and have prolonged your dispute.`
  - `Now bring upon us the chastisement that you threaten us with; do so, if you are truthful.'`

## Ayat 33

- `Noah said:`
  - `'Only Allah will bring it upon you if He so wills,`
  - `and you will be utterly unable to frustrate that.`

## Ayat 34

- `If I want to give you good advice that will not profit you if Allah Himself has decided to let you go astray.`
- `He is your Lord, and to Him will you be returned.'`

## Ayat 35

 - `(O Muhammad!)`
 - `Do they say that he himself has forged this message?`
 - `Tell them:`
   - `'If I have forged this, the guilt of it will fall upon me, but I am not responsible for the crimes you are committing.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The wording of the verse shows that during the recital of the story of Prophet Noah (peace be upon him), the opponents of the Prophet (peace be upon him) might have felt that he himself had invented that story in order to hit them hard indirectly.
  - So they might have interrupted him, saying: You are inventing such stories as these in order to apply these to us and hit us hard indirectly. That is why the narration of the story has been broken to answer their false accusation.
