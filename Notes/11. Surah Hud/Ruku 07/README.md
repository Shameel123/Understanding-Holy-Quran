**Ayat 69 - 83**

## Ayat 69

- `Indeed Our messengers came to Abraham, bearing glad tidings.`
- `They greeted him with 'peace',`
- `and Abraham answered back to them 'peace',`
- `and hurriedly brought to them a roasted calf.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This shows that the angels had come to Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) in the form of human beings and had not disclosed their identity. Therefore he took them for strangers and brought a roasted calf for their entertainment.

## Ayat 70

- `When he perceived that their hands could not reach it, he mistrusted them, and felt afraid of them.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Some commentators are of the view that Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) was afraid of them because of their refusal to eat his meal.
    - He had concluded that they had come to him with some evil intention.
    - For, according to the Arab tradition, if some strangers refused hospitality, it meant that they had not come as guests but as enemies to plunder. But this view is not supported by the succeeding verse.
- `They said:`
  - `'Do not be afraid. We have been sent to the people of Lot.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The wording of their answer shows that Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) had understood from their refusal to eat that they were angels. But he was afraid of their visit because he knew that the coming of the angels in the human shape did not bode well: So he was fearful that they might have come to take them to task for some offense committed by the people of his household or of his habitation or by himself.
      - Had it been the same thing that the commentators presumed, then their answer should have been, “Don’t fear us for we are angels from your Lord.” But the answer they gave to remove his fear, “Don’t have any fear for we have been sent to the people of Lot (and not to you),” shows that Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) knew that they were angels but was troubled in his mind as to the reason of their visit in the human form.
      - This was because the angels came in human form when some one was either to be put to a hard trial or punished severely for some offense.

## Ayat 71

- `And Abraham's wife was standing by and on hearing this she laughed.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It appears from this that the news of the visit of the angels in the human form had made the people of the house uneasy.
    - So Prophet Abraham’s Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) wife had also come there to know what the matter was.
    - She laughed with joy when she learned that the angels were sent not to punish their people but the people of Lot (peace be upon him).
- `And We gave her the good news of (the birth of) Isaac, and after Isaac, of Jacob.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The angels told the good news of a son to Sarah instead of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) because he already had a son, Ismail from Hajirah but had no child from her.
    - Therefore to remove her sorrow they told her the good news that a son, Isaac, will be born to her, who will have a son, Jacob, both of whom will be great Messengers of Allah.


## Ayat 72

- `She said:`
- `'Woe is me!`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - These words were not used by her in their literal sense as an exclamation of grief and lamentation. She uttered these words merely to express surprise at the news.
- `Shall I bear a child now that I am an old woman and my husband is well advanced in years.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - According to the Bible Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) was 100 years old at the time and Sarah was 90 years.
- `This is indeed strange!'`

## Ayat 73

- `They said:`
  - `'Do you wonder at Allah's decree?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The question was posed to her to remind her that though people of old age do not bear children, it is not beyond Allah’s power to bring this about. Therefore a true believer like her should not show any surprise at the good news when it is conveyed to her from Allah.
  - `Allah's mercy and His blessings be upon you, O people of the house.`
  - `Surely, He is Praiseworthy, Glorious.'`

## Ayat 74

- `Thus when fear had left Abraham and the good news had been conveyed to him,`
- `he began to dispute with Us concerning the people of Lot.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “He began to argue with Us” is the expression of affection and endearment which manifests the nature of close relationship of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) with his Lord.
  - This helps depict the picture of the argument that the servant had with his Lord for pleading the case of the people of Lot.
  - He pleaded persistently: Lord, avert the coming scourge from the people of Lot. The 
  - Lord replied: These people have become so degraded that no good was left in them and their crimes have become so heinous that they deserve no leniency at all.
  - But the servant still persisted: Lord, give them more respite, even if a little good yet remains in them; maybe it should bear some fruit. This dispute has been recorded in the Bible rather in detail, but the concise mention in the Quran is more meaningful. (For comparison please refer to Genesis 18: 23-32).

## Ayat 75

- `Surely Abraham was forbearing, tenderhearted and oft-turning to Allah.`

## Ayat 76

- `Thereupon (Our angels) said to him:`
  - `'O Abraham!`
  - `Desist from this,`
  - `for indeed your Lord's command has come;`
  - `and a chastisement which cannot be averted is about to befall them.'`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - A superficial view of this incident from the life of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) in the context it occurs might lead one to consider it to be irrelevant, especially as an introduction to the coming scourge on the people of Lot. But if one reviews this in the light of the object for which these historical events have been related here, one will come to the conclusion that its mention is most apt here. In order to understand its relevancy we should keep in view the following two things:

## Ayat 77

- `And when Our messengers came to Lot,`
- `he was perturbed by their coming and felt troubled on their account, and said:`
  - `'This is a distressing day.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - From the tenor of the details of the story as given in the different parts of the Quran, it becomes quite clear that the angels came to Prophet Lot (peace be upon him) in the form of handsome boys and that he was unaware that they were angels. He was troubled and distressed in his mind, for he knew how wicked and shameless his people were.

## Ayat 78

- `And his people came to him rushing.`
- `Before this they were wont to commit evil deeds.`
- `Lot said:`
  - `'My people!`
  - `Here are my daughters;`
  - `they are purer for you.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - By “My daughters”, Prophet Lot (peace be upon him) might have meant either of the two things.
      - He might have referred to the daughters of the community as “my daughters” because the relationship of a Prophet to his people is as of a father to his children.
      - But it is also possible that he aught have meant by this his own daughters. 
      - Anyhow, this could not have been an offer of adultery, for the succeeding sentence “they are purer for you” leaves no room for such a misunderstanding.
      - This makes it quite obvious that Prophet Lot (peace be upon him) admonished them in this way so as to turn them to the females for the lawful gratification of their sexual desires instead of seeking unnatural ways.
  - `Have fear of Allah and do not disgrace me concerning my guests.`
  - `Is there not even one right-minded person in your midst?'`

## Ayat 79

- `They said:`
  - `'Surely you already know that we have nothing to do with your daughters.`
  - `You also know well what we want.'`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This answer of the people of Prophet Lot (peace be upon him) shows that they had gone to the lowest depth of depravity and openly and brazen facedly declared that they did not want females but males. This was the proof that they had not only left the natural way of purity and strayed into the unnatural way of impurity but had also lost all interest in the natural way of gratification. Such a depraved condition is the worst form of moral degradation, for it shows that no good has been left at all. 
  - Supposing a person has fallen as a victim to an unlawful and sinful behavior, but at the same time considers it to be a wrong behavior which should be avoided, there is hope for the reform of such a person, and even if he does not mend his way the utmost that can be said about him is that he is a depraved person. On the other hand, if a person gives himself wholly to the unlawful because he has no interest in the lawful, such a filthy person is not worthy of being considered a man at all, and therefore should be wiped out of the earth.
  - That is why Allah decreed that the people of Prophet Lot (peace be upon him) should be completely annihilated from the face of the earth.

## Ayat 80

- `He said:`
  - `'Would that I had the strength to set you straight, or could seek refuge in some powerful support.'`

## Ayat 81

- `Thereupon the angels said:`
  - `'O Lot!`
  - `We indeed are messengers of your Lord.`
  - `And your people will in no way be able to hurt you.`
  - `So depart with your family in a part of the night and let no one of you turn around excepting your wife (who shall not go);`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This meant to impress on them the urgency of the matter so that they should get out of the doomed place and should not even turn round to look behind to see what was happening there.
      - They were warned lest they should be attracted by the loud noises caused by the explosions and by the wailing of the people and thus lag behind in the territory that had been marked for the scourge and was to be overtaken by it.
  - `for what will befall them shall also befall her.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The doom of the wife of Prophet Lot (peace be upon him) is the third incident related in this Surah to serve as a lesson that no relationship can deliver a people from the horrible consequences of their sin.
  - `In the morning their promised hour will come. Is not the morning near?'`


## Ayat 82

- `And when Our command came to pass, We turned the town upside down, and rained on it stones of baked clay, one on another,`
