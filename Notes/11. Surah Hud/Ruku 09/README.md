**Ayat 96 - 109**

## Ayat 96

- `And indeed We sent Moses with Our signs and with a clear authority`

## Ayat 97

- `to Pharaoh and his nobles.`
- `But they obeyed the command of Pharaoh even though Pharaoh's command was not rightly-directed.`

## Ayat 98

- `He shall stand at the head of his people on the Day of Resurrection,`
- `and will bring them down to the Fire.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - From this verse and some other narrations of the Quran it appears that the leaders of a community in this world will be its leaders also on the Day of Resurrection.
    - If they guided and led the people towards virtue, righteousness and truth in this world, their followers will gather together under their banner on the Day of Resurrection and march to the Gardens under their leadership.
    - On the other hand, if they called people to some deviation, immorality or unrighteous ways, their followers will follow them there also, and march to the fire of Hell under their leadership.
    - The Prophet (peace be upon him) explained this thing in a tradition: On the Day of Resurrection, the banner of the poets of ignorance will be in the hands of Imra-ul-Quais, and all of them will march towards Hell under his leadership.
- `What a wretched destination to be led to!`

## Ayat 99

- `They were pursued by a curse in this world and so will they be on the Day of Resurrection.`
- `What an evil reward will they receive!`

## Ayat 100

- `That is an account of some towns which We recount to you.`
- `Of them some are still standing and some have been mown down.`

## Ayat 101

- `We did not wrong them;`
- `it is rather they who wronged themselves.`
- `And when the command of your Lord came to pass, the gods besides Allah whom they had called upon, did not avail them in the least.`
- `They added nothing to them except ruin.`

## Ayat 102

- `Such is the seizing of your Lord that when He does seize the towns immersed in wrong-doing, His seizing is painful, terrible.`


## Ayat 103

- `Surely in that is a sign for him who fears the chastisement of the Hereafter.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, in these historical events there is a sign which will show conclusively to the one who considers this deeply that the torment of the Hereafter is inevitable, as warned by the Messengers. One can also judge from this how terrible it will be. This knowledge will fill one with such fear that will keep him on the straight way.
- `That will be a Day when all men shall be mustered together;`
- `that will be a Day when whatever happens shall be witnessed by all.`


## Ayat 104

- `Nor shall We withhold it except till an appointed term.`

## Ayat 105

- `And when the appointed Day comes, no one shall even dare to speak except by the leave of Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is to warn these foolish people who depend on the promises of their intercessors that they would protect them from the torment of the Day.
    - They have been warned to desist from the evil deeds they are committing in the hope that their intercessors would not rest content till they succeed in obtaining from Allah permits of forgiveness for their sinful followers.
    - This is because they believe them to be the beloved favorites of Allah Who cannot afford to displease them at any cost. Then they have been told that, not to speak of wielding any such influence, they shall not dare utter a word except with His permission.
    - No saint, no angel, howsoever high, is so powerful or influential as to speak a word or make any recommendation in the Court of the Highest Sovereign unless He Himself permits it.
    - Therefore such people as make offerings to others than Allah will be utterly disillusioned and disappointed on that Day, for they will come to know that they were foolish in relying on their intercessors and committing evil deeds in the world in the hope that they would deliver them from the torment of the Day.
- `Then some will be declared wretched, others blessed.`

## Ayat 106

- `As for the wretched, they shall be in the Fire, and in it they shall sigh and groan.`

## Ayat 107

 - `They shall abide in it as long as the heavens and the earth endure,`
   - Tahfim-ul-Quran:  
     - This is to emphasize that there is no power that can deliver them from that everlasting torment.
     - Of course, Allah has full powers to forgive anyone He wills or to make a change in the term of the torment of anyone, for He Himself devises laws for Himself and there is no law higher than His Law so as to limit His powers.
 - `unless your Lord may will otherwise.`
 - `Surely your Lord does whatsoever He wills.`

## Ayat 108

- `And as for those who are blessed,`
- `they shall abide in the Garden as long as the heavens and the earth endure,`
- `unless your Lord may will otherwise.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they will not be sent to the Garden nor will dwell there in accordance with any extraneous law which might have forced Allah to let them dwell therein anyhow.
    - They shall dwell there simply because of His favor. He has full powers to make any changes, if He will, about them.
- `They shall enjoy an unceasing gift.`

## Ayat 109 

- `[O Prophet!] Have no doubt about what they worship.`
- `For they worship what their fathers worshipped before.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It does not mean at all that the Prophet (peace be upon him) had any doubts concerning their deities.
    - Though these words have been addressed to the Prophet (peace be upon him), as a matter of fact they are meant for the common people.
    - What they mean is this: No reasonable person should entertain any presumption that the people who worship the deities must have been convinced of their miraculous powers, otherwise they would not have worshiped them nor offered gifts to them nor invoked their help.
    - The fact of the matter is that their worship, their offerings and their prayers are not based on any knowledge nor any experience nor any real observation, but are the result of blind imitation of their forefathers. The proof of their falsehood is that the deities could not save them when Allah's scourge visited their worshipers who were completely annihilated in spite of them.
- `And (yet) We shall grant them their due portion in full, diminishing of it nothing.`
