**Ayat 36 - 49**

## Ayat 36

- `It was revealed to Noah that no more of your people, other than those who already believe, will ever come to believe.`
- `So do not grieve over their deeds,`

## Ayat 37

- `and build the Ark under Our eyes and Our direction.`
- `And do not supplicate Me concerning those who have engaged in wrong-doing.`
- `They are doomed to be drowned.`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse lays down the limits of the divine law of respite. 
  - When the message of a Prophet has been conveyed to a people and is rejected, they are granted respite from punishment only as long as there is the possibility that some of them might accept it.
  - But when there remains no such possibility and there is left nothing but evil element among them, Allah does not grant them any further respite.
  - And this is a manifestation of His mercy, just as for the safety of the good fruit the rotten ones should be thrown away and discarded. Conversely, it shall be an act of cruelty to the good people and the future generations if pity is shown to those wicked people who are incorrigible.


## Ayat 38

- `As Noah was building the Ark, whenever the leading men of his nation passed by him, they would scoff at him.`
- `He said:`
  - `'If you scoff at us, we too scoff at you in like manner.`

## Ayat 39

- `You will come to know who will be struck by a humiliating chastisement, and who will be subjected to an unceasing torment.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is a very appropriate example of the points of view of those who look merely at the surface of things and of others who know the reality about them.
  - It appears that when Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) was building the Ark on the land, it looked to be a ridiculous act to those wicked people who did not believe in him.
  - They jeered at him as if to say: Just see the madness of the old man. He wishes to float a ship on the land. For they could never imagine that after a few days, a ship would actually float there. Therefore naturally they regarded that act of Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) to be a clear proof of his madness. Probably they might be pointing their fingers at him and the Ark he was constructing, saying to one another: Have you any doubt now, if you had any before, that he is really a mad man, who is constructing a ship to float on the waterless land? But the one, who had the knowledge of the reality and who knew that a ship would actually be needed there in the near future, was laughing at their ignorance and lack of knowledge of the real matter and their arrogant self satisfaction, as if to say: How foolish these people are. The catastrophe is threatening them overhead but they are not only self satisfied but also regard me mad, who has warned them of it and who is himself making preparations to meet it. And these are exactly the two ways, in general, of judging the wisdom or folly of things.
  - **One man judges an act to be wise by looking merely at the surface, while the other goes down deep into it and knows it to be foolish.**
  - **Likewise the former considers an act to be foolish and mad while the latter who has the real knowledge of the matter, knows that it is based on wisdom and foresight, and is the very same thing that was required under the circumstances.**

## Ayat 40

- `Thus it was until Our command came to pass and the oven boiled over.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Different interpretations have been given of this, but we are of the opinion that the correct one is the one that is based on the plain words of the text. The deluge started from at-tannur, a particular oven from under which water began to boil up. At the same time heavy rain began to fall and springs began to gush up water from many places in the earth. This is given in detail in( Ayats 11-12 of Surah Al- Qamar): We opened the gates of the sky from which it began to rain heavily and constantly, and We tore open the earth and springs began to gush forth water from every side. Thus the two kinds of water gathered together to fulfill the destined doom.
- `We said:`
  - `'Take into the Ark a pair of every species;`
  - `and take your own family except those who have already been declared (as unworthy);`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - In this connection, it should also be noted that the prefix al (the) before tannur (oven) shows that a particular oven had been specifically marked by God for the purpose of starting the deluge.
      - This began to boil up water as soon as it was commanded to do so, and afterwards it began to be called the oven. It has been explicitly stated in (Ayat 7 of Surah Al- Mominoon) that the said tannur was specified before hand.
  - `and also take everyone who believes.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, don’t embark in the Ark those who had specifically been marked as unbelievers from your household, for they do not deserve to be shown Our compassion.
      - Most probably they were two persons. One was his son who was drowned (Ayat 43), and the other was his wife. (Surah At-Tahrim, Ayat 10). And if there were any others, they have not been mentioned in the Quran.
  - `But those who, along with him, had believed were indeed just a few.`

## Ayat 41

- `Noah said:`
- `'Embark in it.`
- `In the name of Allah is its sailing and its anchorage.`
- `My Lord is Ever Forgiving, Most Merciful.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This humility shown by Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) that his delivery from the deluge was not due to his own plans, measures and efforts but to the mercy and compassion of his Lord, who is most Forgiving, is the true characteristic of a believer.
    - The servant of God adopts all necessary measures as a man of the world does, but he does not put his trust in those measures alone. Along with these he puts his trust in his Lord for their success, because he knows well that no measure can be adopted without His sanction, nor can it be put into practice nor can it achieve the required object unless it is helped by the compassion and favor of Allah.

## Ayat 42

- `The Ark sailed along with them amid mountain-like waves. Noah, spotting his son at a distance, called out to him:`
  - `'My son. embark with us. and do not be with the unbelievers.'`

## Ayat 43

- `The son replied:`
  - `'I will go to a mountain for refuge and it will save me from the water.'`
- `Noah said:`
  - `'None can save anyone today from the command of Allah except those on whom He may have mercy.'`
- `Thereupon a wave swept in between the two and he was drowned.`

## Ayat 44

- `And the command was given:`
  - `'Earth!`
  - `Swallow up your water';`
- `and:`
  - `'Heaven! Abate!'`
- `So the water subsided, the command was fulfilled, and the Ark settled on Mount Judi,`
- `and it was said:`
  - `'Away with the wrong-doing folk!'`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - According to the Quran, the Ark rested upon Mount Judi, which is situated to the north-east of Jazirah Ibn Umar in Kurdistan. But according to the Bible its resting place was Mount Ararat in Armenia, which is one of the ranges of mountains of the same name that extends from Armenia to southern Kurdistan.
  - Mount Judi is one of the mountains of the Ararat range, and is known by the same name even today. The ancient histories confirm that the resting place of the Ark was Mount Judi. For instance, Berasus, a religious leader of Babylonia, who lived about 250 years before Christ, says in his history of the Chaldeans that Noah’s Ark rested upon Mount Judi. Abydenus, a pupil of Aristotle, not only confirms the same but also says that many people of Iraq of his time possessed pieces of the Ark, which they ground in water and gave to the sick as a medicine.

## Ayat 45

- `And Noah called out to his Lord, saying:`
  - `'My Lord!`
  - `My son is of my family.`
  - `Surely Your promise is true,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, You promised that You will save the members of my family from this calamity; so save my son for he is also a member of my family.
  - `and You are the greatest of those who judge.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, You are the greatest of all rulers: therefore Your decision is final and there can be no appeal against it. And You are the best of all rulers: therefore all Your decisions are based on perfect knowledge and absolute justice.

## Ayat 46

- `In response Noah was told:`
  - `'Most certainly he is not of your family;`
  - `verily he is of unrighteous conduct.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Allah has called the wicked son of Prophet Noah (peace be upon him), as “His conduct was other than righteous”, for children are entrusted by the Creator to the care of parents so that they may bring them up and train them to become good persons, and fulfill the purpose for which He created man.
      - If a father does his very best to process and turn the child into a righteous person, but fails in his efforts, the child, who was a sort of raw material in his hands, would be likened to a worthless act. It is obvious that the wicked son was a worthless act, for he was not the sort of good work which his father had desired him to be.
      - So in this sense he did not belong to the family of Prophet Noah (peace be upon him), whom the Creator had sent to mold all his people into good acts, especially those who were of his own flesh and blood. Thus that unrighteous son had forfeited all the rights of blood he had with the Prophet as far as the torment of the deluge was concerned.
  - `So do not ask of Me for that concerning which you have no knowledge.`
  - `I admonish you never to act like the ignorant ones.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Now let us consider the other question:
        - Why was not the request of the Prophet regarding his own flesh and blood granted?
      - The answer is this:
        - If any part of the body of a man becomes so rotten that the surgeon is of the definite opinion that that part must be cut off for the sake of the safety of the rest of the body, the surgeon will not comply with the request of the man not to cut that part of his body, but will say: It is not a part of your body because it is rotten. This will not, however, mean that it was never actually a part of the body but will imply only this: As it has ceased to function rightly as a part of the body, it is no more a part of the body in the sense and for the purpose the healthy parts of the body are its parts. Likewise, when it was said to Prophet Noah (peace be upon him): He is not of your family, it did not negate the fact that he was from his loins but implied: He does not deserve to be treated as a member of your righteous family because of his spoiled morals and conduct. As the torment of the deluge has been brought about to punish those who had sided with the unbelievers in the conflict of kufr and faith, your son does not deserve to be rescued from it along with the believers.
        - Had it been a conflict between your descendants and those of the unbelievers, the result would have been different, but this being a conflict between the righteous and the unrighteous, the former alone will be delivered from it.

## Ayat 47

- `Noah said:`
  - `'My Lord!`
  - `I take refuge with You that I should ask you for that concerning which I have no knowledge.`
  - `And if You do not forgive me and do not show mercy to me, I shall be among the losers.`

## Ayat 48

- `It was said:`
  - `'Noah! Disembark, with Our peace, and with blessings upon you and upon those who are with you.`
  - `There are also people whom We shall allow to enjoy themselves for a while, and then a painful chastisement from Us shall afflict them.'`

## Ayat 49

- `We reveal to you these accounts of matters that are beyond the reach of human perception.`
- `Neither you nor your people knew about them before this.`
- `Be, then, patient.`
- `Surely, the good end is for the God-fearing.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you and your companions will come out successful at the end of the conflict just as Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) and his companions did.
    - For this is the divine law that those who exert for the right cause, avoiding erroneous ways for fear of Allah, should come out successful in the end, even though they should meet with failures in the beginning of the conflict at the hands of the enemies of the truth.
    - Therefore you should patiently bear the afflictions which you are suffering and stand steadfast against the obstacles you are encountering in the way, and you should not be in the least disheartened by the painful and superficial successes of your enemies. If you practice fortitude, you will come out successful in the end like Noah and his companions.
