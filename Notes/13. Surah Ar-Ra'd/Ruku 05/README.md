**Ayat 32 - 37**

## Ayat 32

- `Surely the Messengers before you were ridiculed,`
- `but I always initially granted respite to those who disbelieved,`
- `and then I seized them (with chastisement).`
- `Then, how awesome was My chastisement!`

## Ayat 33

- `Is it, then, in regard to Him Who watches over the deeds of every person1 that they are acting blasphemously by setting up His associates?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they are so audacious that they set up partners with Allah Whose knowledge is All-Comprehensive and Who is aware of even the minutest details of the good and bad actions of each individual.
- `Tell them:`
  - `"Name those associates (if Allah Himself has made them His associates)!`
  - `Or are you informing Allah of something the existence of which He does not even know?"`
  - `Or do people arbitrarily utter empty words?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - These are the audacious things they do.
      - They ascribe partners and equals to Him.
      - They believe that some of His creatures are a part and parcel of His Being, and have attributes and rights like Him.
      - They presume that they shall not be called to account for whatever they do, even though they live in His kingdom.
  - `Indeed, their foul contriving has been made to seem fair to the unbelievers`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, you give empty names to the partners you ascribe to Him for you have no real knowledge about them.
      - For you could get this knowledge only in one of the three following ways.
  - `and they have been barred from finding the Right Way.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - First, you might have received some authentic information that Allah had made such and such people as His partners in His attributes, powers and rights. If it is so, let us also know their names and the source of your information.
  - `Whomsoever Allah lets go astray will have none to guide him.`

## Ayat 34

- `They shall suffer chastisement in the life of the world, and surely the chastisement of the Hereafter is even more grievous.`
- `None has the power to shield them from (the chastisement of) Allah.`

## Ayat 35

- `And such will be the Paradise promised to the God-fearing:`
  - `rivers will flow beneath it,`
  - `its fruits will be eternal,`
  - `and so will be its blissful shade.`
- `That is the ultimate destiny of the God-fearing`
- `while Fire is the destiny of the unbelievers.`

## Ayat 36

- `Those upon whom We bestowed the Scriptures earlier rejoice at the Book revealed to you,`
- `while there are also some among different groups that reject part of it.`
- `Tell them:`
  - `"I have only been commanded to serve Allah and not to associate anyone with Him. To Him do I call, and to Him is my return."`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is in reply to a specific objection which was then raised by the disbelievers. They would say: If he has brought the same message that was brought by the Messengers before him (as he claims), why donâ€™t the Jews and the Christians who are the followers of the former Prophets come forward and welcome it?
  - The verse answers the objection and says that the true followers of the former Prophets really rejoice in the message of the Quran, but the false ones have been offended by it.
  - Then it asks the Prophet (peace be upon him) not to worry at all about this, saying: O Prophet, you should not mind at all whether they are pleased or offended by it. Tell them plainly that this is the guidance I have received from my Lord and I will follow it at all costs.

## Ayat 37

- `And it is with the same directive that We revealed to you this Arabic Writ.`
- `Were you indeed to follow the vain desires of people after the true knowledge has come to you, none will be your supporter against Allah, and none will have the power to shield you from His punishment.`
