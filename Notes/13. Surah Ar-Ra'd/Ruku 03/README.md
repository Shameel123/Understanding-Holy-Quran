**Ayat 19 - 26**

## Ayat 19

- `He who knows that the Book which has been sent to you from your Lord is the Truth, is he like him who is blind to that truth?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, as the attitude of the two in this world will be different from each other, so shall be their ultimate end in the Hereafter.
- `It is only people of understanding who take heed:`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, those who listen to the message that has been sent down by Allah, and accept His Messenger, are really very wise people.
    - This is why their conduct in this world is quite different from those foolish people who are blind to its merits: and so is their ultimate end in the Hereafter, as stated in the subsequent verses.

## Ayat 20

- `those who fulfil their covenant with Allah and do not break their compact after firmly confirming it;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This covenant is the same that was made by Allah with the entire mankind at the beginning of the creation that they would worship Him alone.
    - (Refer to (E.Ns 134 and 135 of Surah Al-Aaraf).
  - As this covenant has been made with every human being, it has been imbued firmly in human nature.
  - When a human being is born in this world, he, so to say, confirms the same covenant because he owes his creation to the same Allah with Whom he had made that covenant. Then he is brought up by His Provider and fed and nourished with His provisions, and uses the powers and faculties endowed by Him. All these things bind him by themselves into a covenant of bondage with his Lord. It is obvious that wise, loyal and faithful people fulfill their covenant and dare not break it except that they might break it unconsciously and unwillingly.

## Ayat 21

- `who join together the ties which Allah has bidden to be joined;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, all those social and civil relations that are conducive to the correct and right conduct of collective human life.
- `who fear their Lord and dread lest they are subjected to severe reckoning;`


## Ayat 22

- `who are steadfast in seeking the good pleasure of their Lord;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Those who are patient”: They remain self possessed and keep under control all their desires and lusts and do not transgress the bounds, and they do not yield to temptations to disobey their Lord in order to gain advantages and gratify their desires.
    - Nay, they bear with calm courage and endurance losses and afflictions that are inevitable in the obedience of Allah.
    - If we consider the life of a believer from this point of view, we shall find that his entire life is the life of endurance and fortitude, for he keeps himself under control in very trying circumstances in this world in the hope of winning the approval of his Lord and in the expectation of gaining permanent benefits in the Hereafter: so he fights with fortitude every temptation to sin.
- `who establish Prayer and`
- `spend both secretly and openly out of the wealth We have provided them, and`
- `who ward off evil with good.`
- `Theirs shall be the ultimate abode`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, if others do evil to them, they do not do evil in return but do good instead.
  - They do not fight mischief with mischief but with virtue.
  - Howsoever unjust one may be to them, they do justice in every case.
  - Likewise, they remain truthful and honest even in the case of those who tell lies against them and show dishonesty towards them.

## Ayat 23

- `- the Ever-lasting Gardens which they shall enter`
- `and so shall the righteous from`
  - `among their fathers,`
  - `and their spouses,`
  - `and their offspring.`
- `And angels shall enter unto them from every gate, and say:`

## Ayat 24

- `"Peace be upon you. You merit this reward for your steadfastness."`
- `How excellent is the ultimate abode!`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This implies two things. The angels will come in large numbers from every side and give them this good news: Now you have come to a place where there is peace for you. Here you are immune from every affliction, every trouble, every hardship, and every danger and worry. 
    - (For details see (E.N. 29 of Surah Al-Hijr).

## Ayat 25

- `As for those`
- `who break the covenant of Allah after firmly confirming it,`
- `who cut asunder the ties that Allah has commanded to be joined, and`
- `who create corruption in the land:`
- `Allah's curse shall be upon them and theirs shall be a wretched abode (in the Hereafter).`

## Ayat 26

- `Allah grants the provision to whomsoever He wills abundantly and grants others in strict measure.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This verse refutes the wrong criterion by which the disbelievers of Makkah (and all other disobedient people of the world) judged whether one was or was not a favorite of God.
    - They judged a man’s worth by his wealth and worldly prosperity and not by his faith and righteous conduct.
    - They thought that the one who was enjoying all the good things of life was a favorite of God, even if he had erroneous beliefs and did wicked deeds.
    - On the other hand, they considered the one who was poor and indigent to be under the wrath of God, even though he was righteous.
    - That is why in their judgment the chiefs of the Quraish were far superior to the followers of the Prophet (peace be upon him).
    - They would say, "You can see for yourselves that God is with the chiefs of the Quraish.
- `They exult in the life of the world, although compared with the Hereafter, the life of the world is no more than temporary enjoyment.`
