**Ayat 27 - 31**

## Ayat 27

- `Those who have rejected (the message of Muhammad) say:`
  - `"Why has no sign been sent down upon him from his Lord?"`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Please also keep in view the answer that has been given to this question in (Ayat 7).
- `Tell them:`
  - `"Allah lets go astray those whom He wills, and guides to Himself those who turn to Him."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This is the answer to their question. It is not due to the lack of signs that they were going astray, but it is the lack of any desire in them to seek right guidance.
      - For Allah does not force one to follow the right way, if he deliberately turns away from it.
      - He lets such persons wander on the wrong ways they choose to wander.
      - Nay, even all those things that should serve as a means to guidance for a seeker of truth become the means of deviation for the one who seeks deviation.
      - So much so that the light which helps show the way to the former, dazzles the eyes of the latter.
      - This is how Allah leads astray a person.

## Ayat 28

- `Such are the ones who believe (in the message of the Prophet) and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah.`
- `Surely in Allah's remembrance do hearts find rest.`

## Ayat 29

- `So those who believe (in the message of the Truth) and do good are destined for happiness and a blissful end.`

## Ayat 30

- `Thus have We sent you as a Messenger1 to a community before which many other communities have passed away that you may recite to them whatever We have revealed to you.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, in this way that We have not given you a sign they demanded.
- `And yet they deny the Lord of Mercy.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, instead of serving that most Compassionate Lord, they are discarding His service and setting up other partners in His attributes, powers, rights and giving thanks to others for His blessings.
- `Say to them:`
  - `"He is my Lord, there is no god but Him.`
  - `In Him I have placed all my trust and to Him I shall return."`

## Ayat 31

- `And what would have happened were a Qur'an to be revealed wherewith mountains could be set in motion, or the earth cleft, or the dead made to speak?1 (To show such signs is not at all difficult for)`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This verse has been addressed to the believers who were feeling uneasy that no such sign was being sent as was demanded by the disbelievers.
      - They thought that such a sign would convince the disbelievers and they would accept Islam.
    - Therefore when no such sign was sent, they became all the more uneasy for the lack of the fulfillment of the demand that gave rise to doubts about the Prophethood of the Messenger (peace be upon him).
    - The question posed in this verse is meant to remove that uneasiness of the Muslims. It is like this:
      - Do you think that they would have embraced Islam if such and such signs had been shown to them all of a sudden along with a Surah of the Quran? Are you under the delusion that they are quite ready to accept Islam and are waiting only for such a sign? Do you think that those people who have failed to see the light of the truth in the teachings of the Quran, in the phenomena of the universe, in the pure and spotless life of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and in the wonderful change in the lives of his companions, would see the light of the truth in the moving of the mountains, in the cleavage of the earth and in the coming out of the dead from the graves?
- `everything rests entirely with Allah.2`
- `So, do not the people of faith (still look forward to such a sign in response to the demand of the unbelievers and) despair as a result of knowing that had Allah so willed, He could have guided all to the Truth.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, if the object had been to make human beings believers even without consciously understanding it, Allah could have created them believers by birth.
- `Misfortune continues to afflict the unbelievers on account of their misdeeds, or to befall on locations close to their habitation.`
- `This will continue until Allah's promise (of chastisement) is fulfilled.`
- `Indeed Allah does not go back upon His promise.`
