**Ayat 01 - 07**

## Ayat 01

- `Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra'.`
- `These are the verses of the Divine Book.`
- `Whatever has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, and yet most (of your) people do not believe.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the introduction to this Surah, in which its aim and object has been enunciated in a few words. Allah has addressed the Prophet (peace be upon him) to this effect: O Prophet, most of your people are rejecting the teachings of the Quran for one reason or the other, but the fact is that what We are sending down to you is the truth whether people believe it or not.

## Ayat 02

- `It is Allah Who has raised the heavens without any supports that you could see,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In other words, “Allah is He who raised the heavens without (any) pillars that you can see.”
    - Though there is nothing apparent and visible that is supporting these heavens, yet there is an invariable and imperceptible Power which is not only holding but keeping in its place each and every one of these huge heavens and whatever is in between them.
- `and then He established Himself on the Throne (of Dominion).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - For further details of “Then He established upon the Throne,” please refer to (E.N. 41 of Surah Al-Aaraf).
    - Here the purpose will be served if it is understood that this thing has been mentioned in the Quran at many places in order to bring out clearly the fact that Allah has not only created the earth, but also rules over His Kingdom, and that His universe is a factory that is not working automatically as some ignorant people seem to think nor is it being ruled by many gods as other ignorant people seem to believe. 
    - But it is a regular system that is being run and ruled over by its Creator.
- `And He it is Who has made the sun and the moon subservient (to a law),`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It should be noted here that the addressees themselves accepted the truth of all the claims that have been made in this verse. Therefore no proofs were required of the facts that it is Allah Who has raised up the heavens without any visible support and subjected the sun and the moon to a fixed order.
    - These things have been mentioned here only as arguments to prove that Allah is the sole Sovereign and ruler of the entire universe.
- `each running its course till an appointed term.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Now let us consider this question: How can such an argument as this convince those who do not believe at all in the existence of God nor acknowledge that He is the Creator of the universe and the Director of all of its affairs?
    - The answer is that the arguments in support of the doctrine of Tauhid advanced in the Quran to convince the mushriks equally apply against the atheists to prove the existence of God.
    - It is like this: The entire universe, the earth, the moon, the sun and the countless heavenly bodies constitute a perfect system which is working under the same all powerful law.
    - This is a proof that such a system must have been designed by some All-Powerful Sovereign, Who possesses wisdom and unerring knowledge.
    - This proves conclusively the existence of that Allah Who has no other equal nor associate nor partner.
    - For there can be no system without an administrator, no law without a ruler, no wisdom without a sage, and no knowledge without the possessor of that knowledge. 
    - Above all, no one can ever conceive that there can be any creation without a Creator except the one who is obdurate or has no sense left in him at all.
- `He governs the entire order of the universe`
- `and clearly explains the signs`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This system is not only a standing proof of the fact that an All-Powerful Sovereign is ruling over it, but is also an evidence of the great wisdom underlying it.
    - It also bears witness that there is nothing everlasting in it. Everything in it remains for a fixed term after which it comes to an end. This is equally true for each and every component part of it as well as for the whole system. It is quite evident from its physical structure that there is nothing everlasting and immortal. There must be some fixed term for the system as a whole, after the expiry of which it shall come to an end.
    - Then there shall be another world. Therefore it is most likely that there shall be Resurrection as predicted in the Quran: nay, its inevitability is beyond any doubt.
- `that you may be firmly convinced about meeting your Lord.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Allah makes plain those signs which help prove the truth of what the Prophet (peace be upon him) was informing them.
    - These signs are spread all over the universe and everyone who observes these with open eyes can perceive that the realities towards which the Quran invites the people are testified by these signs.

## Ayat 03

- `He it is Who has stretched out the earth and has placed in it firm mountains and has caused the rivers to flow.`
- `He has made every fruit in pairs, two and two, and He it is Who causes the night to cover the day.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - After citing some heavenly signs in support of the doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter, a few signs are being cited from the earth for the same purpose. Briefly the following are the arguments for Tauhid, Resurrection and Accountability.
- `Surely there are signs in these for those who reflect.`

## Ayat 04

- `And on the earth there are many tracts of land neighbouring each other.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, If you observe carefully, you will find divine wisdom, design and purpose in the diversity of the structure of the earth.
    - Though it has countless regions adjoining one another, they are different from one another in their shapes, colors, component parts, characteristics, potentialities, productive capacity and source of minerals.
    - This diversity has countless points of wisdom and advantage.
    - Let alone other creatures, if we consider the diversity of regions from the point of the good it has done to mankind, we shall have to acknowledge that this is the result of the well thought and well planned design of the All-Wise Creator. For this diversity has helped the growth of human civilization so much that only an unreasonable person can assign this to mere accident.
- `There are on it vineyards, and sown fields, and date palms: some growing in clusters from one root, some standing alone.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Some of the date palm trees have only a single trunk from the root while others have two or more stems from the same root.
- `They are irrigated by the same water, and yet We make some excel others in taste.`
- `Surely there are signs in these for a people who use their reason.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The things mentioned in this verse contain many other signs besides the proofs of Tauhid and the boundless powers and All-Comprehensive Wisdom of Allah.
    - Let us consider one of these, that is, the diversity in the universe, including mankind. There is the one and the same earth but all its regions are quite different from one another. Then there is one and the same water but it helps to produce different kinds of corn and fruits. Then one and the same tree bears fruits which, in spite of likeness, differ from one another in shapes, sizes, and other features. Then there is one and the same root from which sometimes one and at others two trunks sprout up, with their own different characteristics.
    - If one considers these aspects of diversity, one shall come to the conclusion that the divine wisdom demands the same kind of diversity in the natures, temperaments and inclinations of human beings, and, therefore, in their conducts.
    - So, one need not worry about the existence of this diversity.
    - As it has been stated in (Ayat 31), if Allah had willed, He could have created all human beings alike and virtuous by birth. But the wisdom that underlies the creation of the universe, including mankind, requires diversity and not uniformity. Otherwise, all this creation would have become meaningless.

## Ayat 05

- `And were you to wonder, then wondrous indeed is the saying of those who say:`
  - `"What! After we have been reduced to dust, shall we be created afresh?"`
- `They are the ones who disbelieved in their Lord;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - They “disbelieved in their Lord”: their denial of the Hereafter is, in fact, the denial of the Power and Wisdom of Allah. As they say that it is impossible to bring them again to life after their death, it implies that, God forbid, their Allah Who has created them lacks not only power but wisdom, too.
- `they are the ones who shall have shackles around their necks.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - As a shackle around the neck is a symbol of imprisonment, the words “shackles upon their necks” have been used here idiomatically to show that they are slaves of ignorance, obduracy, lust and are blind followers of their forefathers.
    - As their thinking is influenced by their prejudices, they cannot believe in the Hereafter and would deny this, though there is every reason to believe that it is inevitable.
- `They shall be the inmates of the Fire, wherein they will abide for ever.`

## Ayat 06

- `They challenge you to hasten the coming of evil upon them before the coming of any good,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This refers to the demand of the Quraish from the Prophet (peace be upon him): If you are a true Prophet (peace be upon him) of God, why don’t you hasten to bring that scourge of God upon us of which you have been threatening us, when we are flouting and denying you? They did this in different ways. Sometimes they would invoke God mockingly and say: O Lord, settle our accounts now and do not postpone these to the Day of Resurrection. At another time, they would say: Our Lord, if what Muhammad (peace be upon him) says be true, and be from Thee, then stone us from the sky or send down some other scourge upon us from the sky or send down some other painful torment upon us.
    - In this verse an answer has been given to such impudent demands of the disbelievers. They have been admonished to refrain from such foolish demands and avail of the respite that was being given to them and mend their ways, for they were incurring the wrath of God by adopting the attitude of rebellion.
- `although people who followed a like course before had met with exemplary punishment (from Allah).`
- `Verily your Lord is forgiving to mankind despite all their wrong-doing.`
- `Verily your Lord is also severe in retribution.`

## Ayat 07

- `Those who refused to believe in you say:`
  - `"Why has no (miraculous) sign been sent down upon him from his Lord?"`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This showed their mentality.
      - The only criterion of judging whether Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a true Prophet or not according to these disbelievers, was whether he would perform a miracle to them.
      - This was because they would not judge his message by rational arguments: they would not learn a lesson from his high character nor from the moral revolution that was being brought about among his companions by his message and noble example: nor would they carefully consider the rational arguments given in the Quran to prove the errors of their religion of shirk and superstitions of ignorance. They would ignore these rational things and demand a miracle to decide the issue.
- `You are only a warner, and every people has its guide.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the concise answer to their demand, though it has not been directly addressed to the disbelievers but to the Messenger (peace be upon him).
    - It is this: O Prophet, you should not worry at all about some miracle which you might show to these people in order to convince them, for it is not a part of your mission. Your duty is only to warn the people of their negligence and of the evil consequences of their wrong ways. And for this purpose, We have always sent a guide to every people. Now you, too, are performing this duty, and it is for them to open their eyes and judge the truth of your Message.
    - After giving this concise answer, Allah overlooks their demand but warns them, in the succeeding verses, that they have to deal with the All- Knowing Allah Who has full knowledge about everyone of them from the time they were in the wombs of their mothers, and Who keeps a keen watch over everything they do. Therefore their fates shall be decided strictly with justice in accordance with their merits and that there is no power on the earth and in the heavens that can influence in the least His decisions and judgments.
