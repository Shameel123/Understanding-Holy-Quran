**Ayat 08 - 18**

## Ayat 08

- `Allah knows what every female bears;`
- `and what the wombs fall short of (in gestation),`
- `and what they may add.1`
- `With Him everything is in a fixed measure.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - When amplified the verse will mean: Allah remains fully aware of all the developments that take place in the child while in its mother’s womb, and He watches over the decrease or increase in each of its limbs, and its potentialities, capabilities and powers.

## Ayat 09

- `He knows both what is hidden and what is manifest. He is the Supreme One, the Most High.`

## Ayat 10

- `It is all the same for Him`
- `whether any of you says a thing secretly, or says it loudly, and`
- `whether one hides oneself in the darkness of night, or struts about in broad daylight.`

## Ayat 11

- `There are guardians over everyone, both before him and behind him, who guard him by Allah's command.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Allah not only directly watches over whatever each person does, and is fully aware of everything he does, but He has also appointed such guardians as accompany him everywhere and keep a full record of all his deeds.
    - This has been stated here to warn those people who live their lives under the delusion that they have been left absolutely free to do whatever they like and shall not be required to render an account of what they did in this worldly life. The warning is that such people invite their own retribution.
- **`Verily Allah does not change a people's condition unless they change their inner selves.`**
- `And when Allah decides to make a people suffer punishment, no one can avert it. Nor can any be of help to such a people against Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is to warn them further that they should not remain under any delusion that some holy person or saint or angel has the power to rescue them from divine retribution, for there is none who could defend them against Allah, even though they might have been paying homage and making offerings to their so called patrons and protectors in the hope that they would rescue them from punishment from Allah on the Day of Judgment.

## Ayat 12

- `He it is Who causes you to see lightning that inspires you with both fear and hope,`
- `and He it is Who whips up heavy clouds.`

## Ayat 13

- `The thunder celebrates His praise and holiness,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The thunder is a proclamation of Tauhid for those who have ears to hear the real meaning of its loud noise which follows the flash of lightning, though it is merely a kind of noise for those who hear it like animals.
    - For it proclaims that Allah Who raises clouds from the oceans and carries them wherever He wills, and makes the lightning flash from the clouds and then turns them into rain so as to supply water to the dwellers of the earth, is perfect and worthy of all praise, is All-Wise and All-Powerful and is flawless in every respect and has do partner whatsoever.
- `and the angels, too, celebrate His praise for awe of Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The mention of the fact that the angels are filled with awe of their Lord, and they proclaim His praise has a special significance here.
    - This is to refute the shirk of the ignorant people who have always worshiped the angels as gods and deities and believed them to be partners with God in His Godhead. It has been stated that they are not partners with Allah but His most obedient servants; so much so that they praise Him and are filled with awe of Him.
- `He hurls thunderbolts, striking with them whom He wills while they are engaged in disputation concerning Allah.`
- `He is Mighty in His contriving.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - He has countless plans and measures which are so effective and sudden that He can smite anyone with any one of them from any side He wills. So much so that the intended victim is absolutely unaware of it. This is a proof that those people, who say absurd things about such All- Powerful Being, are absolutely void of sense.

## Ayat 14

- `To Him alone should all prayer be addressed,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “For Him is the supplication of truth,” for Allah alone has the power and the authority to give help and remove difficulties.
- `for those to whom they do address their prayers beside Him are altogether powerless to respond to them.`
- `The example of praying to any other than Allah is that of a man who stretches out his hands to water, asking it to reach his mouth, although water has no power to reach his mouth.`
- `The prayers of the unbelievers are a sheer waste.`

## Ayat 15

- `All that is in the heavens and the earth prostrates itself, whether willingly or by force, before Allah;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “And to Allah falls in prostration whoever is in the heavens and the earth” in the same sense that every creation of His has to obey and submit to His Physical law in every detail.
    - The only difference between the submission of a believer and an unbeliever is that the former submits to it with a willing heart while the latter is forced to do so against his will, for it is absolutely beyond his power to oppose it.
- `and so do their shadows in the morning and in the evening.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Their shadows” in the sense that they fall to the west in the morning and to the cast in the evening and so on. This shows that they, too, have to submit to some law.

## Ayat 16

- `Ask them:`
  - `"Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?"`
- `Say: "Allah."`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It will be worthwhile to note that though the question, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?” was put to the disbelievers, Allah told the Prophet (peace be upon him) to answer it himself and say, “Allah”.
    - This was because the disbelievers hesitated to answer it one way or the other. They could not say that it was not Allah for they themselves believed that Allah was the Creator of everything.
    - On the other hand, they could not acknowledge this fact in so many words in answer to such question. For, they would then have to acknowledge the doctrine of Tauhid. Then no basis could have been left in favor of shirk.
    - As they realized their weak position, they would not give any answer to such questions.
    - That is why Allah asks His Messenger (peace be upon him) to put such questions to the disbelievers: “Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth? Who is the Lord of the Universe? Who sustains you with provisions of life?”
    - When they do not give any answer to such questions, Allah asks His Messenger (peace be upon him) to say “Allah” in answer.
    - He then proceeds on with this argument: When Allah does all these things, how do the deities you worship come in?
- `Tell them:`
  - `"Have you taken beside Him as your patrons those who do not have the power to benefit or to hurt even themselves?"`
- `Say:`
  - `"Can the blind and the seeing be deemed equals?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The blind man is the person who cannot see any of the countless signs of the Oneness of Allah, though these lie spread over before him in the universe.
      - On the other hand, the seeing man is the person who can see in every particle of the universe and in every leaf of grass and tree signs pointing to their Creator.
      - Thus the question that has been posed means: O disbelievers, if you are blind to the signs, why should the one who can see the signs should behave like a blind man and stumble along like you?
  - `Or can light and darkness be deemed equals?"`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Here “light” means the light of the knowledge of the truth which the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his followers possessed.
      - In contrast to this, there was the “darkness” of ignorance in which the disbelievers were wandering about.
      - The question that has been posed means to ask this: Why should those, who have received the light, extinguish it and wander about in the darkness like you? Well, if you do not know the worth of the light, you may choose to wander in the darkness. But how can you expect the one who has received the light and who appreciates the difference between the light and the darkness, and who is seeing the right way as if in broad daylight, to leave the light and wander about in the darkness?
- `If that is not so, then have those whom they associate with Allah in His Divinity ever created anything like what Allah did so that the question of creation has become dubious to them?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The question is intended to impress on the disbelievers that there is absolutely no reason why they should practice shirk.
    - When they themselves admit that their gods did not create even an iota in the universe and that they do not have even the smallest and most insignificant share in the creation, there remains no ground for them to cherish any doubts about it.
    - Why should, then, their false gods and deities share the rights and powers of the Real Creator?
- `Say:`
  - `"Allah is the creator of everything. He is the One, the Irresistible."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The Arabic word Qahhar literally means “The one who rules over all by virtue of His own power, and keeps all under His complete control.”

## Ayat 17

- `Allah sends down water from the heavens and the river-beds flow, each according to its measure, and the torrent carries along a swelling scum.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this simile the knowledge which had been sent down by Allah to the Prophet (peace be upon him) has been likened to the rain from the sky, and the believers to the streams, rivulets and rivers.
    - Just as the streams etc. fill themselves with rain water, each according to its capacity, so his followers gained knowledge from him, each according to his ability.
    - On the other hand, the hue and cry that was raised by the opponents of the Islamic movement has been likened to the swelling foam etc. that begins to dance about on the surface of flood water, but soon vanishes away.
- `In like manner, from that metal which they smelt in the fire to make ornaments and utensils, there arises scum like it.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - As it is but natural that scum should appear on the surface when ornaments are heated in the furnace for purification, likewise bad people would come to the surface and take prominent part in persecuting the good people who are passed through the furnace of persecution for their purification.
- `Thus does Allah depict truth and falsehood.`
- `As for the scum, it passes away as dross; but that which benefits mankind abides on the earth.`
- `Thus does Allah explain (the truth) through examples.`

## Ayat 18

- `There is good reward for those who respond to the call of their Lord.`
- `And those who do not respond to their Lord, (a time will come when) they shall offer all they have - even if they have all the riches of the world and the like of it besides to redeem themselves (from the chastisement of Allah).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This shows that the disbelievers would be in such a sad plight that they would not hesitate to give their all for their redemption.
- `They will be subjected to a severe reckoning and Hell shall be their refuge. What a wretched resting place it is!`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Those will have the worst reckoning”: they shall have to bear the full consequences of their evil deeds. No sin, no shortcoming, in short, nothing will be forgiven and no evil shall go unpunished.
