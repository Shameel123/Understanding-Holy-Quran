**Ayat 11 - 17**

## Ayat 11

- `(O Prophet), the bedouins who were left behind say to you:`
  - `“We were occupied with our goods and families. So ask forgiveness for us.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This refers to the people living in the suburbs of Al- Madinah whom the Prophet (peace be upon him) had invited to accompany him in his march out for Umrah, but they had not left their homes in spite of their claim to faith just because they were afraid of death. Traditions show that these were the people of the tribes of Aslam, Muzainah, Juhainah, Ghifar, Ashja, Dil and others.
- `They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts.`
- `Say to them:`
  - `“Who can be of any avail to you against Allah if He should intend to cause you any harm or confer upon you any benefit?”`
- `Allah is well aware of all that you do.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - (1) That after your returning to Madinah the excuse that these people will present for not going out with you, would only be a lame excuse, because they know in their hearts why they had stayed behind.


## Ayat 12

- `(But the truth is not what you say.) You had imagined that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families, and this notion was embellished in your hearts.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you were delighted to think that you had saved yourselves from the danger into which the Messenger (peace be upon him) and his believing supporters were going. You thought you had done so by dint of your great wisdom; and you also did not feel any compunction in rejoicing at the thought that the Messenger (peace be upon him) and the believers would not return alive from their expedition. You did not feel uneasy in spite of your claim to the faith but were pleased to think that you did not put yourselves in the danger by accompanying the Messenger (peace be upon him).
- `You harboured an evil thought, and you are an immensely evil people.”`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word ba-ir (pl. bur in the original) has two meanings:


## Ayat 13

- `As for those who do not believe in Allah and His Messenger,`
- `for such unbelievers We have prepared a Blazing Fire.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here, Allah in clear words is declaring all such people disbelievers and devoid of the faith, who are not sincere with regard to Allah and His religion, who shirk endangering their interests, their lives and wealth for the sake of Allah’s religion when the time comes of their trial and test. But one should remember that this is not the sort of disbelief on the basis of which somebody in the world may be regarded as excommunicated from Islam, but this is the disbelief because of which he will be declared a disbeliever in the Hereafter. The reason is that the Prophet (peace be upon him) even after the revelation of this verse did not regard as outside Islam those people in respect of whom it was sent down, nor treated them like the disbelievers.

## Ayat 14

- `To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth.`
- `He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom He pleases.`
- `He is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate.`

## Ayat 15

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the time is approaching when these very people who were shirking accompanying you on the dangerous journey, would see you going on an expedition in which there would be the possibility of attaining easy victory and much booty. Then they would come running and request you to take them also along.
  - Such a time came just three months after the truce of Hudaibiyah, when the Prophet (peace be upon him) marched to Khaiber and took it easily. At that time everyone could see that after the truce with the Quraish not only Khaiber but the Jewish settlements of Taima, Fadak, Wadi-al-Qura and also others from northern Arabia would not be able to withstand the might of the Muslims and would easily fall to the Islamic State.
  - Therefore, Allah in these verses forewarned the Prophet (peace be upon him) that the opportunists of the suburbs of Al-Madinah would come up to take part in and receive their share when they would see easy victories being attained, and that he should tell them plainly: You will never be allowed to take part in these, because only those who had gone forth to offer their lives in the conflict at Hudaibiyah regardless of every danger would be entitled o them.


- `When you press forth for the spoils, those who were left behind will say:`
  - `“Let us accompany you.”`
- `They want to change the command of Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Allah’s Word implies the decree that only those people would be allowed to accompany the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the expedition to Khaiber, who had taken part in the expedition to Hudaibiyah and sworn the pledge there, for Allah has reserved the spoils of Khaiber exclusively for them, as has been stated clearly in verse 18 below.
- `Say to them (in clear words):`
  - `“You shall not accompany us. Thus has Allah already said.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The words “Thus did Allah say before” caused the people the misunderstanding that this refers to some other command bearing upon the same subject that might have been sent down before this verse, and since no such command is found in this Surah before this verse, they started looking for it at other places in the Quran till they found (verse 84 of Surah At-Taubah), in which this very subject has been dealt with for another occasion. But that verse, in fact, does not apply to this, for it was sent down in connection with the Battle of Tabuk, and its period of revelation is three years after the period of revelation of Surah Al-Fatah. The fact of the matter is that this verse refers to( verses 18-19) of this Surah itself, and Allah’s already having said this does not mean its having been said before this verse but its having been said to the laggards before this conversation.
      - This conversation with the laggards about which advance instructions are being given to the Prophet (peace be upon him) was to take place at the time of the expedition to Khaiber, and this whole Surah, including (verses 18-19), had been sent down three months earlier on return from Hudaibiyah on the way. A careful study of the context shows that Allah here is giving this instruction to His Messenger: When after your return at Al-Madinah the laggards come to you with their excuses, you should give them this reply, and when they express their desire to accompany you in the expedition to Khaiber, you should tell them this.
- `Then they will say:`
  - `“Nay; but you are jealous of us.”`
- `The truth is that they understand little.`

## Ayat 16

- `Say to the bedouins who were left behind:`
  - `“You will be called against those who possess great might and be asked to fight against them unless they surrender.`
  - `If you obey (the command to fight), Allah will bestow upon you a goodly reward.`
  - `But if you turn away, as you turned away before, He shall inflict upon you a grievous chastisement.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The words au-yuslimuna in the original can have two meanings and both are implied:
    - (1) That they should accept Islam.
    - (2) That they should submit to the Islamic rule.


## Ayat 17

- `There is no blame on the blind, nor on the lame, nor on the sick (if they do not go forth to fight).`
- `Allah will admit those who obey Allah and His Messenger to the Gardens beneath which rivers flow and will inflict a grievous chastisement on those who turn away.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the one who has a genuine excuse for not joining jihad is not accountable, but if the able-bodied, strong people make excuses for not joining it, they cannot be regarded as sincere with regard to Allah and His religion, and they cannot be given the opportunity to take advantage of the gains as members of the Muslim community, but when time comes for making sacrifices for Islam, they should lag behind and seek the safety of their lives and properties.
