**Ayat 12 - 21**

## Ayat 

- `Allah it is Who has subjected the sea to you so that ships may sail upon it at His bidding`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - For explanation, see (Surah Bani-Israil, Ayats 66-67); (Surah Ar-Room, Ayat 46 and the corresponding E.Ns), and(E.N. 55 of Surah Luqman);(E.N. 110 of Surah Al-Mumin) and(E.N. 54 of Surah Ash-Shura).
- `and you may seek of His Bounty and give thanks to Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Seek His bounty: Seek lawful provisions by trade, fishing, diving, navigation and other means in the sea.

## Ayat 13

- `He has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and the earth,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - For explanation, see (Surah Ibrahim, Ayat 32 and E.N. 44 )on it, and(E.N. 35 of Surah Luqman).
- `all being from Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This sentence has two meanings:
      - (1) This gift and favor of Allah is not like the gift of the worldly kings, who favor their favorites with the wealth that they have collected from the people themselves, but, on the contrary, all the good things in the universe have been created by Allah Himself, and He has granted these to man from Himself.
- `Verily there are Signs in this for those who reflect.`

## Ayat 14

- `(O Prophet), tell the believers to indulge those who have no fear of any evil days coming upon them from Allah`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Literally: Who do not except the days of Allah. But in Arabic usage on such occasions, ayyam does not merely mean days but those memorable days in which important historical events may have taken place.
    - For example, the word ayyam-ul-Arab is used for the important events of the history of the Arabs and the major battles of the Arab tribes, which the later generations remember for centuries. Here, ayyam-Allah implies the **evil days of a nation when the wrath of Allah may descend on it and ruin it in consequence of its misdeeds**. That is: Those who do not fear the coming of evil days from Allah, i.e. those who do not fear that a day will come when they will be called to account for their actions and deeds, and this same fearlessness has made them bold and stubborn in acts of wickedness.
- `so that Allah may Himself requite them for their deeds.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The commentators have given two meanings of this verse and the words of the verse admit of both:

## Ayat 15

- **`Whoever acts righteously, does so to his own good; and whoever commits an evil will suffer its consequence.`**
- **`All of you will then be sent back to your Lord.`**

## Ayat 16

- `Indeed We endowed the Children of Israel with the Book and Wisdom and Prophethood,`
- `and provided them with good things as sustenance,`
- `and exalted them above the peoples of the whole world.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Hukm (judgment) implies three things:
    - (1) Knowledge and understanding of the Book and Religion.


## Ayat 17

- `We gave them clear directions in matters pertaining to religion.`
- `Yet they differed among themselves (not out of ignorance but) after knowledge had come to them;`
- `and they did so out of the desire to commit excesses against one another.`
- **`On the Day of Resurrection Allah will judge among them regarding what they had differed.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:  
  - For explanation, see (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 213); (Surah Aal-Imran, Ayat 19) and (E.Ns 22, 23 of Ash-Shura).


## Ayat 18

- `And then We set you, (O Prophet), on a clear high road in religious matters.`
- `So follow that and do not follow the desires of those who do not know.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It means: The mission that had been entrusted to the children of Israel before you has now been entrusted to you. They, in spite of receiving knowledge, created such differences in religion out of selfish motives and stirred up such divisions among themselves that they became disqualified to call the people to God’s way. Now you have been set upon the clear pathway of religion so that you may perform the service which the children of Israel have failed to perform and became disqualified to perform it. (For further explanation, see (Ash-Shura, Ayats 13-15 and E.Ns 20 to 26).)

## Ayat 19

- `Surely they will be of no avail to you against Allah.`
- `Indeed the wrong-doers are friends of each other,`
- `whereas Allah is the friend of the God-fearing.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, if you make any changes in Allah’s religion only to please them, they will not be able to save you from Allah’s accountability and punishment.


## Ayat 20

- `These are the lights of discernment for people and guidance and mercy for those endowed with sure faith.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, this Book and this Shariah present such a light for all the people of the world, which distinguishes the truth from falsehood, but only such people receive any guidance from it who believe in its truth; for them only it is a mercy.

## Ayat 21

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - After the invitation to Tauhid, the discourse now turns to the theme of the Hereafter.

- `Do the evil-doers imagine that We shall make them equal to those who believe and do good, making their lives and deaths alike?`
- `How vile is their judgement!`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the moral reasoning for the truth of the Hereafter. The difference of good and evil in morals and of goodness and wickedness in deeds necessarily demands that the good and the evil people should not meet with one and the same end, but the good should be rewarded for their good and the wicked punished for their evil deeds. Otherwise, if the good and the evil end up similarly, the distinction of virtue and vice in morals becomes meaningless and God becomes unjust. The people who follow evil ways in the world do want that there should be no accountability and no rewards and punishments, for this concept goes against their enjoyment of life, but it is against the justice and wisdom of the Lord of the worlds that He should treat the good and the evil alike, and should not care to see how the righteous believer has lived his life in the world and how the sinful unbeliever has been enjoying it.
  - One of them kept himself subjected to moral restrictions all his life, rendered the rights of those to whom they were due, restrained himself from the unlawful benefits and pleasures, and continued to incur losses for the sake of the truth. The other fulfilled his desires in every possible wary, neither recognized the rights of God nor hesitated from violating the rights of the people, but went on collecting benefits and good things of life in every possible way.
  - Can it be expected of God that He would overlook the difference between the lives of the two kinds of men? If the end of both be the same, no greater injustice could be conceived. (For further explanation, see (Surah Younus, Ayat 4); (Surah Houd, Ayat 106); (Surah An-Nahl, Ayats 38,39); ( Surah Al- Hajj, E.N. 9), (Surah An-Naml, E.N. 86),(Surah Ar-Rum, Ayat 7-8); (Surah Suad, Ayat 28;and E.N. 30) on it.)
