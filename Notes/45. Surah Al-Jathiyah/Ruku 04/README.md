**Ayat 27 - 37**

## Ayat 27

- `Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth,`
- `and on the Day when the Hour (of Resurrection) shall come to pass, the followers of falsehood shall be in utter loss.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In view of the context, this sentence by itself gives the meaning that it is not at all beyond the power of God Who is ruling over this great and marvelous universe that He should bring the human beings whom He has created in the first instance back into existence once again.

## Ayat 28

- `On that Day you shall see every people fallen on their knees.`
- `Every people will be summoned to come forth and see its Record and will be told:`
  - `“Today you shall be requited for your deeds.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the dread and terror of the Plain of Resurrection and the awe of the divine court will be such that it will break the stubbornness of the most arrogant and boastful people, and everyone will be found fallen on his knees humbly.

## Ayat 29

- `This is Our Record which bears witness against you with truth; We used to record all what you did.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The only possible way of getting a thing recorded is not by means of the pen and paper only. Man himself has discovered in this world several other forms of recording human words and actions and reproducing them exactly and accurately; and we cannot even imagine what other possibilities of it lie yet undiscovered, which man himself will discover and exploit in the future.
  - Now, who can know how and by what means is Allah getting recorded man’s every word, his every movement and action, even his hidden intentions and motives and desires and ideas, and how He will place before every man and every group and every nation his or its whole lifework accurately and exactly?

## Ayat 30

- **`As for those who believe and act righteously, their Lord shall admit them to His Mercy. That indeed is the manifest triumph.`**

## Ayat 31

- `But those who denied the Truth, they shall be told:`
  - `“Were My Signs not rehearsed to you?`
  - `But you waxed proud and became a guilty people.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, you thought it was below your dignity to believe in Allah’s revelations and submit to them, and considered yourselves to be above subjection and servitude.


## Ayat 32

- `And when it was said to them:`
  - `“Surely Allah's promise is true, and there is no doubt regarding the Hour of Resurrection,”`
- `you were wont to say:`
  - `“We do not know what the Hour (of Resurrection) is. We are simply making conjectures and are not at all certain.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The people mentioned in (verse 24 )above were those who denied the Hereafter openly and absolutely, here those who are not sure of it although they do not deny its possibility because of conjecture. 
  - Apparently there is a vast difference between the two groups in that one of them denies the Hereafter absolutely and the other regards it as possible on the basis of conjecture. But as for the result and final end, there is no difference between them, for the moral consequences of the denial of the Hereafter and of lack of the faith in it are the same.
  - A person, whether he disbelieves in the Hereafter or lacks faith in it, will in either case be inevitably devoid of the feeling of accountability before God, and this lack of feeling will necessarily involve him in the error and deviation of thought and action.
  - Only faith and belief in the Hereafter can keep a man on the right track in the world. In the absence of it, both doubt and denial give him a similar attitude of irresponsibility, and since this same attitude of irresponsibility is the real cause of man’s being doomed in the Hereafter, therefore neither the denier of it can escape Hell nor the one who lacks faith in it.

## Ayat 33

- `(On that Day) the evil of their deeds will become apparent to them`
- `and what they had mocked at will encompass them,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, there they will come to know that their ways of behavior, their practices and manners, and their actions and pastimes, which they regarded as very good in the world were, in fact, very bad: they had committed a basic mistake in thinking that they were not answerable to anyone, and this had rendered their entire lifework fruitless and vain.

## Ayat 34

- `and it will be said:`
  - `“We will forget you today as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours. The Fire shall now be your abode, and you shall have none to come to your aid.`

## Ayat 35

- `You reached this end because you made Allah's Signs an object of jest and the life of the world deluded you.”`
- `So they shall not be taken out of the Fire nor shall they be asked to make amends (and thus please their Lord).` 

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This last sentence depicts the manner of a master who after rebuking some of his servants turns to others and says: Well, these wretched people now deserve such and such punishment!

## Ayat 36

- **`So all praise be to Allah, the Lord of the heavens, the Lord of the earth, the Lord of the whole Universe.`**

## Ayat 37

- **`His is the glory in the heavens and the earth. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Wise.`**
