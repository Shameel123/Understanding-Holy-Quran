_Date: 01-10-2024_ from Ayat 13


**Ayat 01 - 29**

## Ayat 01

- `Ha'. Mim.`

## Ayat 02

- `By the Clear Book.`

## Ayat 03

- `We revealed it on a Blessed Night, for We were intent on warning;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The meaning of taking an oath by the lucid Scripture has been explained in (E.N.1 of Surah Az-Zukhruf). Here also what has been sworn by is that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is not the author of this Book but We are the author, and this Book by itself is enough to provide a proof of that. 
  - Furthermore, it has been said that the night in which it was revealed was full of blessings. That is, the foolish and ignorant people, who have no idea of their own well being or otherwise, regard the revelation of this Book as a disaster for themselves and are deeply anxious as how to get rid of it. But, as a matter of fact, the Hour when We decided to send down this Book to arouse the heedless, was highly blessed for them and for all mankind.


## Ayat 04

- `(We revealed it on the Night) wherein every matter is wisely determined`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The word amr-in-hakim as used in the text has two meanings: 


## Ayat 05

- `by Our command.`
- `Verily, We were set to send a Messenger`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In Surah Al-Qadr, this same thing has been expressed thus: The angels and the Spirit (Angel Gabriel) descend in it with every decree, by the leave of their Lord. This shows that it is such a night in the divine administration of Allah in which He decides the destinies of the individuals and nations and countries and entrusts His decisions to His angels, who then implement them accordingly. Some commentators among whom Ikrimah is most prominent, have been involved in the misunderstanding that this is the 15th night of Shaban, for in some traditions it has been said that the destinies of people are decided during that night. But Ibn Abbas, Ibn Umar, Mujahid, Qatadah, Hasan Basri, Saeed bin Jubair, Ibn Zaid, Abu Malik, Dahhak and many other commentators agree that this is the same night of Ramadan, which has been called lailat-ul-qadr, for the Quran itself has stated this, and where any Quranic statement exists, no other view can be formed on the basis of random reports. Ibn Kathir says: The traditions that Imam Zuhri has related from Uthman bin Muhammad that destinies are decided from one Shaban to the next Shaban is an indirect tradition and such traditions cannot be cited as against the clear texts of the Quran. Qadi Abu Bakr Ibn al-Arabi says: No Hadith in respect of the 15th of Shaban is reliable, either in respect of its merit, or about this that decisions with regard to the destinies are taken in it; therefore, they do not merit attention, (Ahkam ul-Quran).


## Ayat 06

- `as a Mercy from your Lord.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it was not only a demand of wisdom to send a Messenger with this Book but also of Allah’s mercy, for He is the Provider, and Provider requires that not only should arrangements be made for nourishing the servants’ bodies but they should also be afforded right guidance by knowledge, that they should be made aware of the distinction between right and wrong and that they should not be left wandering in darkness.
- `Surely He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The object of mentioning these two attributes of Allah in this context is to warn the people of the truth that He alone can give correct knowledge for He alone knows all the realities. Not to speak of one man, even if all men join to determine a way of life for themselves, there can be no guaranty of its being the right way, for even the entire mankind together cannot become all-hearing and allknowing. It does not lie in its power to comprehend all those realities whose knowledge is essential for determining a correct way of life. This knowledge is only with Allah. He alone is All-Hearing and All-Knowing. Therefore, He alone can tell what is guidance for man and what is falsehood, what is the truth and what is wrong, what is good and what is evil.


## Ayat 07

- `the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of all that is between them: if you would only have sure faith.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Arabs themselves admitted that Allah alone is the Lord (Master and Provider) of the Universe and of everything in it. Therefore, it has been said to them: If you are not admitting only verbally but are really conscious of His being the Provider and are convinced of His being the Master, you should admit that:


## Ayat 08

- `There is no god but He:`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The real God Who alone has the right that He should be worshiped and served.
- `He gives life and causes death.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, there is no god other than Allah, nor can there be. Therefore, it is against reason that you should disdain the worship of Him Who breathed life into dead matter and made you a living man. And Who possesses full powers to keep you alive as long as He likes and bring your life to an end whenever He likes. So, it is against reason that you serve any other than Him, or start worshiping others besides Him.
- `He is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers of yore.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - There is a subtle allusion in it to this: He is also Lord of those of your ancestors who took other gods besides Allah; they had not done the right thing by giving up their real Lord and serving others that you should be justified in imitating them and regard their conduct as an argument for the soundness of your creed. They ought to have served only Him, because He alone is their Lord.

## Ayat 09

- `(But the fact is, they lack certainty) and frolic about in doubt.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In this brief sentence an allusion has been made to an important truth. **Even atheists or polytheists do come across occasions when their being from within says: There is somewhere some weakness in the creed that we have adopted.** The atheist may apparently be very firm in his denial of God, his heart at one or the other time does bear the testimony that this wonderful and wise system which extends from the particle of dust to the galaxies and from a blade of grass to the creation of man, could not come into existence without an All-Wise Designer. Likewise, a polytheist may be deeply submerged in his polytheism, his heart also sometimes cries out: Those whom you have adopted as deities cannot be God.
  - But this testimony of the heart neither leads the atheist nor the polytheist to the conviction about the existence and Oneness of God, nor to conviction and satisfaction about their creed of atheism and polytheism itself. Instead, their religion, in fact, is based on doubt, no matter how convinced they might appear to be of its truth.
  - As for the question: Why doesn’t this doubt make them restless and why don’t they seek the truth seriously so as to obtain a satisfactory ground for their convictions? **The answer is: they lack seriousness in religious matters.** What they really regard as important are the worldly earnings and acquisitions and their enjoyment, in search of which they expend all their powers and abilities of the heart and mind and body. As for the religious matters, they are in fact no more than fun, a mere pastime, amusement, or a mental diversion for them, for which they cannot spare even a few moments of serious study. Religious rites are being performed as an entertainment; discussions about denial and atheism are being engaged in as an amusement. No one can spare a few moments from his worldly pursuits to consider whether he has turned away from the truth, and if so, what would be its consequences.


## Ayat 10

- `So watch for the Day when the sky will come down with a pall of smoke,`

## Ayat 11

- `enveloping people.`
- `that will be a grievous scourge.`

## Ayat 12

- `(People will then say):`
  - `“Our Lord, remove this scourge from us; we shall believe.”`

## Ayat 13

- `But how will they take heed?`
- `Such are they that a Messenger`
- `came to them clearly expounding the Truth,`

## Ayat 14

- `yet they turned away from him and said:`
  - `“This is a well-tutored madman.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - What they meant was: this was a simple man, some others have incited and deceived him. They secretly forge and teach him verses of the Quran, and he comes and recites them before the people. They sit back in peace and leave him alone to receive the abuses and be pelted with stones. They would make a mockery of all the arguments, the admonitions and the serious teachings which the Prophet (peace be upon him) had been presenting since several years and was growing weary. Neither they paid any attention to the rational things being expressed in the Quran nor recognized the extraordinary character of the man who was presenting them, nor took any trouble to think what nonsense they were uttering when they imputed such things to the Prophet (peace be upon him).
  - Obviously, if there had been another person who gave secret instruction to the Prophet (peace be upon him), he could not have remained hidden from Khadijah and Abu Bakr, Ali and Zaid bin Harithah and other early Muslims, who were the closest and constant companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Then, how it is that these very people only became his most devoted and dedicated followers, whereas if the business of prophethood had depended on the secret instruction of some other person, these very people would have been in the forefront to oppose him
  - (For further explanation, see (Surah An-Nahl, Ayat 103); (Surah Al-Furqan, Ayats 4-6) and the corresponding E.Ns).
  

## Ayat 15

- `Yet We will hold the scourge back for a while,`
- `(but no sooner than We will do so) you will revert to your old ways.`

## Ayat 16

- `The Day when We shall seize them with a mighty seizing,`
- `that will be the Day on which We shall inflict upon you full retribution.`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The commentators have seriously disputed the meaning of these verses, and the difference of opinion existed even in the time of the companions. 
  - Masruq, the well-known student of Abdullah bin Masud, states: One day when we entered the mosque of Kufah, we saw a preacher addressing the people. He recited the verse: Yauma tatissama- u bidukhan-im-mubin, then asked: Do you know what kind of smoke it is? This smoke will appear on the Day of Resurrection and will make the disbelievers and the hypocrites blind and deaf, but the believers will be affected only to the extent as if they had caught cold.
    - Hearing this commentary we went to Abdullah bin Masud and reported to him what the preacher had said. Abdullah at that time was lying down. On hearing this commentary he sat up startled and said: **When a person does not have the knowledge, he should ask those who have it.**
  - The fact is that when the people of the Quraish went on refusing to accept Islam and continued to oppose the Prophet (peace be upon him), the Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed: *O God, help me with a famine like the famine of Joseph (peace be upon him); consequently, a very severe famine overtook Makkah and the people were forced to eat bones, skins and carrion. The conditions became so bad that whoever looked up to the sky would see nothing but smoke due to intensity of hunger.* At last, Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said: **You tell the people to treat their kindred kindly, your own people are starving, kindly pray to God to remove this calamity.**
  - This was the time when the people of the Quraish had started saying: O God, if You remove this torment from us, we will believe. This same event has been referred to in these verses; and the severest blow implies the calamity that was inflicted on the Quraish in the Battle of Badr. 
    - This tradition has been related by Imam Ahmad, Bukhari Tirmidhi, Nasai, Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from Masruq with several chains of authorities. Besides Masruq, Ibrahim Nakhai Qatadah, Asim and Amir have also related that Abdullah bin Masud had given the same commentary of this verse. Therefore there cannot be any doubt that Ibn Masud actually held this same opinion. Among the immediate followers of the companions, Mujahid, Qatadah. Abul Aliyah, Muqatil, Ibrahim Nakhai, Dahhak and Atiyyah al-Aufi and others have also concurred with Ibn Masud in this commentary.

## Ayat 17

- `Indeed before that We subjected the Pharaonites to the same test.`
- `A noble Messenger came to them`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The words rasul-un karim in the original imply a man who is characterized with most noble traits of character and highly praiseworthy qualities.

## Ayat 18

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - One should note that the sayings of the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) being cited here, are not parts of a continuous address delivered by him at any one time, but they are a summary in a few sentences of what he said to Pharaoh and his courtiers on different occasions during many years.
  - (For the details, see(Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 103-136);(Surah Younus, Ayats 75-92); (Surah TaHa, Ayats 45-76); (Surah Ash-Shuara, Ayats 10-68); (Surah An-Naml, Ayats 7-14);(Surah Al-Qasas, Ayats 32-42); (Surah Al-Mumin, Ayats 23-46); (Surah Az-Zukhruf, Ayats 46-56); and the corresponding E.Ns.)

- `(and said):`
  - `“Deliver to me Allah's servants.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, leave the children of Israel to go with me. This demand is synonymous with the demand made in(Surah Al- Aaraf, Ayat 105); (Surah TaHa, Ayat 47 )and(Surah Ash- Shurra, Ayat 17).
      - Another translation that has been reported from Abdullah ibn Abbas is: Servants of Allah, fulfill my right, i.e. accept what I say, believe in me, follow my guidance. This is my right on you from Allah.
      - The following sentence: I am a trustworthy Messenger to you is more in keeping with the second meaning.
  - `I am a trustworthy Messenger to you,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, I am a reliable Messenger: I do not forge anything from myself, nor am I the one who would present something based on personal interest or desire, or forge a command or law, in the name of Allah. Rest assured that I shall convey to you intact only that which my Sender has commanded. It should be noted that these two sentences belong to the time when the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) first started preaching Allah’s message.

## Ayat 19

- `and do not exalt yourselves in defiance of Allah.`
- `I have come to you with a clear authority (as a Messenger).`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In other words, it means: Your rebellion against me is in fact rebellion against Allah, for what annoys you is not what I say but what Allah says, and I only present those things as His Messenger. If you doubt whether I have really been sent by Hun or not, I present before you a clear authority of my appointment from Allah.
  - This authority does not imply any one miracle but a long series of the miracles which the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) continued to show to Pharaoh and his people for years since the time he came in the court of Pharaoh till his last days in Egypt. Whatever sign they denied, was followed up by a greater sign of authority by him.
  - (For explanation, see (E.Ns 42, 43 of Surah Az-Zukhruf).)

## Ayat 20

- `I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord lest you should attack me with stones.`

## Ayat 21

- `But if you do not believe what I say, leave me alone (and desist from laying hands on me).”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran
  - This was said at the time when, as against all the signs presented by the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him), Pharaoh was still showing stubbornness, but was feeling upset and confounded at the realization that all classes of the Egyptian society were rapidly being influenced by those signs.
  - In that period, first of all he made the speech before his packed court as mentioned in (verses 51-53 of Surah Az- Zukhruf (see E.Ns 45 to 49)), then, when he felt the ground slipping from under his feet, he made up his mind to kill Allah’s Messenger.
  - At that time the Prophet (peace be upon him) said the words as mentioned in (Surah Al-Mumin, Ayat 27) to the effect: **I have taken refuge in my Lord and your Lord against every arrogant person who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.**
  - Here, the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) is referring to that same thing and telling Pharaoh and his chiefs: Look, I have sought Allah’s refuge against all sorts of violence from you, now you cannot harm me. But if you wish yourselves well, do not harm me. If you do not want to believe what I say, you may not, but you should never lay your hands on me, otherwise you will meet with catastrophic consequences.


## Ayat 22

- `Then he called upon his Lord:`
  - `“These are a criminal people.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the final report that the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) presented before his Lord, saying: These are the people who are criminals. That is, their being the criminals has been confirmed finally and absolutely. They have exhausted every chance of concession and respite for reformation. It is time that the final fatal decision be passed against them.


## Ayat 23

- `(He was told):`
  - `“Set out with My servants by night` 
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - With my servants: With all those people who have believed, including both the Israelites and the Egyptian Copts who had become Muslims since the time of the Prophet Joseph till that of the Prophet Moses (peace be upon them), and those also who had been influenced by the signs shown by Moses (peace be upon him) and His preaching and accepted Islam from among the Egyptians. (For explanation, see (Surah Yousuf: E.N. 68).)
  - `for you will certainly be pursued.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This was the initial command given to the prophet Moses (peace be upon him) for the migration.
      - (For explanation, see (Surah TaHa, Ayat 77); (Surah Ash-Shuara, Ayats 52-68) and the corresponding E.Ns).


## Ayat 24

- `And leave the sea behind you as calm as ever`
- `Surely they are an army that is doomed to be drowned.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This command was given when the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) had crossed the sea along with his caravan and wanted that he should restore the sea to its former state by smiting it with the staff so that Pharaoh and his hosts should not pursue them on the dry path created by the miracle.
  - At that times it was said: Leave the sea divided as it is, so that Pharaoh and his armies should descend into it. Then the sea will be restored and they will be drowned all together.


## Ayat 25

 - `How many gardens did they leave behind, and how many fountains`

## Ayat 26

- `and sown fields and splendid mansions,`

## Ayat 27

- `and the life of ease in which they took delight!`

## Ayat 28

- `Thus it was; and We made another people inherit all that.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Hasan Basri says that “other people” here implies the children of Israel, whom Allah made heirs of the land of Egypt after Pharaoh’s people, and Qatadah says it implies the other people who inherited Egypt after the people of Pharaoh, for the history does not make any mention that the Israelites ever returned to Egypt after the exodus and inherited it. This same point has been disputed by the later commentators also. (For a detailed discussion, see (Surah Ash Shuara, Ayats 57-59) and the E.Ns on it).


## Ayat 29

- `Then neither the sky shed tears over them nor the earth.`
- `They were granted no respite.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, when they were the rulers, they were known for their glory and grandeur, hymns were sung of their praise, flatterers flattered them to such an extent as if the whole world was devoted to them for their excellences and indebted to them for their favors and there was none more popular in the world than they. But when they fell, there was none to shed a tear on their fall, rather the world felt relieved that a cause of distress had been removed. Obviously, they had neither done any good to the people that the dwellers of the earth might weep on them, nor anything for the sake of Allah’s pleasure that the dwellers of the heavens might grieve over their ruin. As long as Allah continued to give them respite by His will, they enjoyed life as they pleased; but when they transgressed all limits in their crimes, they were cast aside like rubbish.
