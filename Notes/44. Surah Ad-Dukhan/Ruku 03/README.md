## Ayat 51

- `Verily the God-fearing shall be in a secure place`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - A secure place: A place safe from every kind of fear, grief, worry and danger, hardship and trouble. According to a Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: It will be proclaimed to the dwellers of Paradise: You will remain in good health, will never fall ill, will live forever, will never die, will ever remain happy and prosperous and will never meet with a misfortune, will ever remain youthful, will never become old. (Muslim, on the authority of Abu Hurairah and Abu Saeed Khudri).

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Sundus and istabraq in the original are fine silk cloth and thick silk cloth respectively.


## Ayat 54

- `Thus shall it be: and We shall espouse them to fair, wide-eyed maidens.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In the original, hur-un ein means fair complexioned, large-eyed women. (For further explanation, see (E.Ns 28 and 29 of Surah As-Saaffat).)

## Ayat 55

- `While resting in security, they shall call for all kinds of fruit.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, they will order the attendants in Paradise to bring anything they would like in any measure they would demand, and it will be presented before them. In this world, a man cannot ask for a thing in an inn, or even his own things in his own house, with the freedom and satisfaction as he will ask for these in Paradise. 
  - For, in the world nothing is found anywhere in unlimited measure, whatever man uses here, he has to pay for it. In Paradise, things will belong to Allah, and the servants will enjoy full freedom to use them. Neither will there be the danger of the failure of the supply, nor the necessity of a bill to pay.


## Ayat 56

- `They shall not taste death except the death in this world.`
- `And Allah will save them from the chastisement of Hell`

## Ayat 57

- **`(O Prophet), We have made this Book easy in your tongue so that they may take heed.`**

## Ayat 59

- `Wait, then; they too are waiting.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, if they do not accept the admonition even now, you should wait to see how they are visited by their doom; and they are also waiting to see what becomes of the message that you are giving them.
