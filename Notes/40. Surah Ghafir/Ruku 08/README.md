**Ayat 69 - 78**

## Ayat 69

- `Did you not see those who dispute concerning Allah's Signs?`
- `Whence are they, then, being turned astray?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, have you not understood even after the above discourse what is the real source of these people’s misunderstanding and misconduct, and what has caused them to go astray? (One should note that the addressee here is not the Prophet (peace be upon him) but every such person who reads these verses or hears them read).

## Ayat 70

- `Those who gave the lie to this Book`
- `and all the Books which We had sent with Our Messengers`
- `shall soon come to know the Truth`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the real cause of their going astray. Their denial of the Quran and the teachings brought by the Messenger (peace be upon him) of Allah and their resisting by disputation the revelations of Allah instead of pondering over them seriously, was the basic cause, which has led them astray and exhausted all possibilities of their adopting the right way.

## Ayat 71

- `when fetters and chains shall be on their necks, and they shall be dragged into`

## Ayat 72

- `boiling water, and cast into the Fire.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, when compelled by the intensity of thirst they will ask for water, the keepers of Hell will drag them by the chains towards the springs of boiling water, and when they will have drunk from them, they will drag them back to be cast into the fire of Hell.

## Ayat 73

- `It will then be said to them:`
  - `Where are those whom you`

## Ayat 74

- `associated with Allah in His Divinity?”`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, if they really were gods or associates in Godhead, and you worshiped them in the hope that they would help you in the evil time, then why don’t they come to rescue you now?
- `They will say:`
  - `“We have lost them; rather, we never used to call upon anyone before.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - They do not mean to say, we did not associate them with God in the world, but they mean: Now we have understood well that those whom we invoked in the world were nothing and mere nonentities.
- `Thus will Allah cause them to stumble in error.`

## Ayat 75

- `(They will be told):`
  - `“This is because while you were on earth you took delight in untruth and exulted in it.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, you not only followed that which was untrue and false, but you became so enamored of the untruth that when the truth was presented before you, you paid no heed to it, but continued to exult in your worship of the falsehood.

## Ayat 76

- `Enter Hell now to abide in it. How woeful is the abode of those who wax proud!`

## Ayat 77

- `So be patient, (O Prophet).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you should have patience at what those people say and do, who are opposing you by disputation and wrangling and want to defeat you by mean devices.
- `Surely Allah's promise is true.`
- `Whether We show them a part of the woeful consequences against which We warn them (while you are still in their midst) or We recall you (from this world) before that,`
- `eventually it is to Us that they shall be brought back.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it is not necessary that We should punish every such person who has tried to harm you, in this world and during yow lifetime. Whether a person receives his punishment here or not, he cannot in any case escape our grasp: He has to return to Us after death. Then he will receive full punishment of his misdeeds.

## Ayat 78

- `Indeed We sent many Messengers before you:`
- `of them there are some whose account We have narrated to you and there are others whose account We have not narrated to you.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - A new theme starts from here. The disbelievers of Makkah said to the Prophet (peace be upon him): We would not believe you to be Allah’s Messenger unless you showed us the miracle that we ask you to show us. In the following verses an answer is being given to this very demand without mentioning it. (For the type of the miracles they demanded, see (Surah Houd, Ayat 12); (Surah Al-Hijr, Ayat 7); (Surah Bani Israil, Ayats 90-93); (Surah Al-Furqan, Ayat 21) and the E.Ns thereof).
- `It did not lie in any Messenger's power to bring any Sign except with Allah's leave.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, no Prophet ever showed a miracle by his own will and desire, nor had any Prophet the power to show a miracle by himself. Whenever a miracle was shown through a Prophet, it was shown when Allah willed it to be shown through him to the disbelievers. This is the first answer to the disbelievers' demand.
- `So when Allah's decree came, the matter was decided with justice, and those steeped in error courted utter loss, then and there.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, a miracle has never been shown for the mere fun of it. It is a decisive thing. If a nation does not believe even after a miracle has been shown, it is destroyed. You are demanding a miracle only for the sake of fun, but you have no idea that by making such a demand you are, in fact, inviting your own doom. This is the second answer to their demand.
    - (For details, please see (Surah Al-Hijr, Ayats 8, 58-60); (Surah Bani Israil, Ayat 59); (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 5-9); (Surah Al-Furqan, Ayats 22-23);(Surah Ash- Shuara, Ayats 66-67) and the E.Ns thereof).
