**Ayat 01 - 09**

## Ayat 01

- `Ha'. Mim.`

## Ayat 02

- `This Book is a revelation from Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing;`

## Ayat 03

- `the Forgiver of sins,`
- `the Accepter of repentance,`
- `the Stern in retribution,`
- `the Bountiful.`
- `There is no god but He.`
- `To Him are all destined to return.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the introduction to the discourse. By this the listener has been forewarned to the effect: What is being presented before you is not the word of an ordinary being but of that God Who has infinite power. After this, some of Allah’s attributes have been mentioned, one after the other, which bear a deep relevance to the following theme:

## Ayat 04

- `None but the unbelievers`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here, the word kufr has been used in two meanings: for ingratitude and for denial of the truth.
    - According to the first meaning, the sentence would mean: As against the revelations of Allah this sort of behavior is adopted only by those who have forgotten His bounties and who have even lost the feeling that it is by His bounty that they are flourishing.
    - According to the second, it would mean: This sort of behavior is adopted only by those who have turned away from the truth and are determined not to accept it.
    - From the context it becomes obvious that here the disbeliever does not imply every non-Muslim, for a non- Muslim who disputes a point in good faith for the sake of understanding Islam, and who tries to grasp thoroughly those things which he fends hard to follow, although a non Muslim technically, yet that which has been condemned in this verse does not apply to him.
- `dispute regarding the Signs of Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - There is a gap between the previous sentence and this, which has been left for the listener to fill.
    - From the context and style it becomes evident that those who adopt the attitude of disputation as against the revelations of Allah Almighty, can never escape the punishment. Therefore, they shall inevitably meet their doom.
    - Now, if one sees that those people, even after adopting such an attitude, are strutting about, their business is flourishing, their governments functioning in a grand style and they are enjoying the good things of life, one should not be misled into thinking that they have escaped Allah’s punishment, or that war against Allah’s revelations is a sport which can be adopted as a pastime and its evil consequences warded off easily. **This, in fact, is a respite which they have been granted by Allah.** Those who abuse this respite for doing more mischief are indeed preparing for an ignominious end.
- `So let not their strutting about in the land delude you.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the torment that seized them in the world was not their final punishment, but Allah has also decreed that they shall go to Hell.
    - Another meaning can be: Just as the nations of the past have gone to their doom, so will those people also who are committing disbelief go to Hell, according to the fixed decree of Allah.

## Ayat 05

- `Before them the people of Noah also gave the lie (to Messengers), and so did many parties after them.`
- `Each nation sallied forth against its Messenger to seize him, and they disputed with false arguments seeking therewith to repudiate the Truth.`
- `Then I seized them; and behold, how woeful was My retribution!`

## Ayat 06

- `Thus has the decree of your Lord become due against the unbelievers.`
- `They are destined for the Fire.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the torment that seized them in the world was not their final punishment, but Allah has also decreed that they shall go to Hell.
  - Another meaning can be: Just as the nations of the past have gone to their doom, so will those people also who are committing disbelief go to Hell, according to the fixed decree of Allah.

## Ayat 07

- `The angels that bear the Throne`
- `and those that are around to extol your Lord's glory with His praise,`
- `they believe in Him,`
- `and ask forgiveness for the believers,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This thing has been said for the consolation of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) companions, who were feeling greatly discouraged at the impudence and rebellious attitude of the disbelievers of Makkah as against their own helplessness, as if to say: Why do you feel grieved at what these mean and worthless people say? You have the support of the angels who bear the divine Throne and of those who stand around it. They are interceding with Allah for you. The mention of the angels who bear the divine Throne and of those who stand around it, has been made, instead of the common angels, to impress the fact that not to speak of the common angels of divine kingdom, **even the angels who are the pillars of this kingdom, being nearest in rank and station to Allah, bear deep sympathy and regard for you**.
    - Then the words: They affirm faith in Him and ask forgiveness for the believers, show that the relationship of the faith is the real relationship, which has joined the heavenly creatures and the earthly creatures together, and which has induced sympathy and esteem in the angels stationed around the Throne for the mortal humans inhabiting the earth, who affirm faith in Allah just like them.
    - The angels affirming the faith in Allah does not mean that they could disbelieve, and they adopted belief instead of disbelief, but it means that they believe in the sovereignty of Allah, the One, alone there is no other being that may be commanding them and they submit before it in utter obedience.
    - When the same attitude and behavior was adopted by the human believers, a strong relationship of cherishing a common creed and faith was established between them and the angels in spite of the great disparity in species and remoteness in rank and station.
- `saying:`
  - `“Our Lord! You encompass everything with Your Mercy and Knowledge.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, the weakness, lapses and errors of Your servants are not hidden from You. You indeed know everything, but like Your knowledge, Your Mercy also is infinite. Therefore, forgive the poor creatures in spite of knowing their errors.
      - Another meaning can be: Forgive by Your Mercy all those about whom by knowledge You know that they have repented sincerely and have, in reality, adopted Your way.
  - `So forgive those that repent and follow Your Path,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - To forgive and to save from the torment of Hell are although not related, and there seems to be no need to mention the other when one has been mentioned, this style, in fact, reflects **the deep interest the angels have in the believers**.
      - It is customary that when a person who is deeply involved in a matter, finds an opportunity to make submissions before a judge, he presents the same petition humbly over and over again, in different ways, and does not rest content with making the petition just once.
  - `and guard them against the chastisement of Hell.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - And save those who have given up disobedience and rebellion, adopted obedience and followed the way which You Yourself have shown.

## Ayat 08

- `Our Lord, admit them to the everlasting Gardens You have promised them`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here again there is the same state of solicitude as referred to in E.Ns above.
    - Obviously, forgiving and saving from Hell by itself amounts to admitting to Paradise.
    - And then soliciting Allah for granting the believers the same Paradise which He Himself has promised them, seems to be unnecessary, but the angels are so earnest in their desire of well-being for the believers that they go on repeating their good wishes for them although they know that Allah will certainly bless them with these favors in the Hereafter.
- `and those of their fathers and spouses and progeny that were righteous.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is. join with them their parents and their wives and children for the comfort of their eyes.
    - This same thing Allah Himself has stated as among the blessings which the believers will be granted in Paradise.
    - For this see (Surah Ar- Raad, Ayat 23) and (Surah At-Toor, Ayat 21).
    - In the verse of Surah At-Toor, there is also the explanation that if a person will deserve a higher rank in Paradise, which his parents will not deserve, he will not be lowered in rank to be joined with them but Allah will raise them to join him in the higher station.
- **`Surely You alone are Most Mighty, Most Wise;`**

## Ayat 09

- `and guard them against all ills.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word sayyiat (evils) is used in three different meanings and all three arc implied here:
      - (1) False beliefs, perverted morals and evil deeds.
      - (2) Consequences of deviation and evil deeds.
      - (3) Calamities, disasters and suffering in this world, or in barzakh, or on the Day of Resurrection.
    - The object of the angels’ prayer is that they be saved from everything which may be evil for them.
- `He whom You guard against ills on that Day, to him You have surely been Most Merciful.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Evils of that Day” implies the dread and terror of the Day. deprivation of the shade and every other comfort, severity of accountability, the ignominy of exposing every secret of life before all mankind, and other humiliations and hardships which the guilty ones will experience in the Hereafter.
- `That is the great triumph.”`
