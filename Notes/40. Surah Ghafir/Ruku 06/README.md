**Ayat 51 - 60**

## Ayat 51

- `Surely We shall help Our Messengers and the believers in the life of this world`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - For explanation, see (E.N. 93 of Surah As-Saaffat).
- `and on the Day when witnesses will rise to testify,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, when Allah’s Court will be established and the witnesses will be produced before Him.

## Ayat 52

- `the Day when the excuses offered by the wrong-doers shall not avail them.`
- `They shall be victims of the curse and a woeful abode.`

## Ayat 53

- `We surely guided Moses`
- `and made the Children of Israel the heirs of the Book`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, We did not just leave Moses alone when We sent him against Pharaoh, but We gave him guidance at every step till success.
  - This contains a subtle allusion to the effect: O Muhammad, We shall help you too in the same manner. We have neither left you alone after raising you as a Prophet in the city of Makkah and the tribe of Quraish so that these wicked people may treat you as they like, but We Ourselves are with you and are giving you guidance at every step.

## Ayat 54

- `which was a guidance and good counsel to people endowed with understanding and wisdom.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is just as those who disbelieved in Moses (peace be upon him) were deprived of this blessing and the Israelites who believed in him were made heirs to the Book, so will also those who deny you be deprived and only those who believe in you will have the good fortune to inherit the Quran and rise in the world as the standard bearers of guidance.

## Ayat 55

- `Be steadfast,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Have patience”: Bear up with a cool mind against these hardships through which you are passing.
- `then, (O Prophet),`
- `Allah's promise is true.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The allusion is to the promise made above in the sentence: We do help Our Messengers and the believers in the life of this world.
- `Seek forgiveness for your shortcomings,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - A study of the context shows that here “sin” implies the state of impatience that was being caused to the Prophet (peace be upon him) on account of the severe antagonism, especially the persecution of his followers.
    - He earnestly desired that either some miracle should be shown, which should convince the disbelievers or something else should soon come down from Allah, which should quell the storm of opposition.
    - Though this desire in itself was not a sin, which should have called for repentance, the high rank with which Allah had blessed the Prophet (peace be upon him) demanded great grit and will power; so the little impatience shown by him was regarded as inconsistent with his high rank. 
    - Therefore, he was required to ask Allah’s forgiveness for showing the weakness and was told to hold his ground like a rock as a man of a high rank like him should.
- `and celebrate the praise of your Lord, evening and morning.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Glorification of Allah with His praises is the only means by which those who work for the sake of Allah can get the strength to resist and overcome the hardships faced in the way of Allah. Glorifying the Lord morning and evening can have two meanings:

## Ayat 56

- `Verily those who dispute regarding the Signs of Allah without any evidence that might have come to them, nothing but vain pride fills their hearts.`
- `Yet they shall never be able to satisfy the pride`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the real cause for their opposition without any argument and their irrational crooked argumentation is not that they do not understand the thruth and the themes of goodness and reform being presented before them in the form of the revelations of Allah; therefore, they dispute about them in good faith in order to understand them.
    - But the actual reason for their wrong attitude is that their selfconceit does not permit any tolerance. They do not want that in Arabia the guidance and leadership of Muhammad (peace be upon him) should be accepted and acknowledged. 
    - And ultimately one day they themselves should have to accept the leadership of the person against whom they think they have a greater right to be the chiefs and leaders. That is why they are straining every nerve not to let Muhammad (peace be upon him) have his way, and they do not hesitate to use any mean device whatsoever for the purpose.
- `with which they are puffed up.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In other words it means: He whom Allah has made great, will remain great, and the efforts of the small people who are trying to establish their superiority will ultimately end in failure.
- `So seek refuge with Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, just as Moses (peace be upon him) had become free from fear and anxiety after invoking Allah Almighty’s help and refuge against Pharaoh’s threats, so should you also seek His help and refuge against the threats and conspiracies of the chiefs of the Quraish, then should busy yourself in raising His word being free from every anxiety.
- **`Verily He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.`**

## Ayat 57

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - After reviewing the conspiracies and plots of the chiefs of the Quraish in (verses 21-56), the address is now being directed towards the common people, and they are being made to understand that the truths to which Muhammad (peace be upon him) is inviting them, are absolutely rational, as if to say: Your own good and well-being lies in accepting them, and rejecting them is ruinous for your own selves.
  - In this connection, first of all arguments have been given for the doctrine of the Hereafter, for the disbelievers regarded this very doctrine as most bewildering and incomprehensible.

- `Surely the creation of the heavens and the earth is a greater act than the creation of human beings.`
- `But most people do not know.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is an argument for the possibility of the Hereafter. The disbelievers thought it was impossible for man to be resurrected after death. In answer to this, it is being said: Those who talk like this are, in fact, ignorant. If they use their common sense, they will easily understand that for that God Who has created this wonderful Universe it cannot at all be difficult to create men once again.

## Ayat 58

- `Never can the blind and the seeing be equal;`
- `nor those that believe and act righteously and those that do evil.`
- `Little do you understand.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is an argument for the necessity of the Hereafter.
  - In the preceding sentence it was said that the Hereafter can take place, and its occurrence is not impossible.
  - In this it is being said that the Hereafter should take place. It is the demand of both reason and justice that it should occur, and its nonoccurrence is against reason and justice. After all, how can a reasonable man believe it to be right that those who live like the blind in the world and fill God’s earth with mischief by their immoral and wicked deeds, should not see the evil end of their misdeeds and wrong conduct. Likewise, those people who pass their lives in the world with open eyes, and believe and do good works, should be deprived of seeing a good result of their righteousness? If this is expressly against reason and justice, then the belief of denying the Hereafter also should be against reason and justice, for the non-occurrence of the Hereafter means that the good and the bad should both become dust after death and meet with one and the same end. For in this case, not only are reason and justice destroyed but morality also is proved to be meaningless and absurd. For if good and evil have one and the same end and destiny, then the evildoer would be highly wise, because he gratified all his desires before his death, and the good man highly foolish because he kept himself subjected to every sort of moral restoration without any reason.

## Ayat 59

- `The Hour will indeed come;`
- `there is no doubt about that.`
- `Yet most people do not believe.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the absolute assertion about the occurrence of the Hereafter, which can be made only on the basis of knowledge and not on the basis of reasoning, and in no other discourse than of revelation this assertion can be made with such absoluteness. That which can be said without revelation only on the basis of intellectual reasoning is that Resurrection can take place and it should take place. Beyond this, to assert that Resurrection will certainly take place, can be said only by that Being Who knows that Resurrection will occur, and that Being is none but Allah. It is here that it becomes explicit and evident that if religion can be based on pure knowledge, instead of speculation and reasoning, it can only be on the knowledge obtained through divine revelation.

## Ayat 60

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - After the Hereafter, the discourse now turns to Tauhid which was the second point of dispute between the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the disbelievers.
- `Your Lord said:`
  - `“Pray to Me, and I will accept your prayers.`
  - `Surely those who wax too proud to worship Me shall enter Hell, utterly abased.”`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, all the powers to answer our prayers rest in Me only; so you should not pray to others but pray to Me. To understand the spirit of this verse well, three points should be comprehended properly:
    - First, man prays only to that being whom he regards as All- Hearing and All-Seeing and Possessor of supernatural powers. And the real motive of prayer for man is the internal feeling that the natural means and resources of the material world are not enough to remove any of his troubles and to fulfill any of his needs, or are not proving to be enough. Therefore, it is inevitable that he should turn to a being who is possessor of supernatural powers and authority. Man invokes that Being even without having seen Him; he invokes Him at all times, at all places, and under all circumstances; he invokes Him in solitude, aloud as well as in a low voice, and even in the depths of his heart. He does so inevitably on the basis of the belief that that Being is watching him everywhere, is also hearing whatever he has in his heart, and possesses such absolute powers that, it can come to the help of the supplicant wherever he is, and can help him out of every trouble and difficulty. After having known this truth about the prayer, it remains no longer difficult for man to understand that the one who invokes another than Allah for help, commits shirk absolutely and purely and clearly, for he believes those attributes to be belonging to the other being, which only belong to Allah. Had he not believed the other being to be an associate of Allah in the divine attributes, he would never have even thought of invoking it for help.
