**Ayat 79 - 85**

## Ayat 79

- `Allah it is Who has made cattle for you so that you ride some of them and from some of them you derive food.`

## Ayat 80

- `In them there are also other benefits for you,`
- `and through them you fulfil your heartfelt need (to reach places),`
- `and you are borne along upon them as upon the ships.`

## Ayat 81

- `Allah shows His Signs to you;`
- `then which of Allah's Signs will you deny?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It means this: If you are not demanding a miracle only for the sake of fun and amusement but want to have the satisfaction whether that to which Muhammad (peace be upon him) is inviting you (i.e. Tauhid and the Hereafter) is true or not, then God’s those signs which you are observing and experiencing at all times, are quite enough.
  - For there remains no need for other signs when there are these signs to help you understand the truth.
  - This is the third answer to their demand of the miracles. This answer also has been given at several places in the Quran and we have given detailed commentary on it.
    - ((See Surah Al-Anaam, Ayats 37-39); (Surah Younus, Ayat 101);(Surah Ar-Raad, Ayats 7- 13);(Surah Ash-Shuara, Ayats 4-9) and the E.Ns thereof).

## Ayat 82

- `Did they not journey in the land that they may behold the end of those who had gone before them?`
- `They were more numerous and greater in strength and left behind more splendid traces in the land.`
- `Yet their attainments did not avail them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the conclusion to the discourse. While studying this please also keep in view( verses 4-5) and( verse 21) of this Surah.

## Ayat 83

- `When their Messengers came to them with Clear Signs, they arrogantly exulted in whatever knowledge they had.`
- `They were then encompassed by what they had mocked.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, they took their philosophy and their science, their law, their secular sciences and their mythology and theology invented by their religious guides as the real knowledge, and regarded the Knowledge brought by the Prophets of Allah as worthless and therefore paid no heed to it.

## Ayat 84

- `When they saw Our chastisement,`
- `they said:`
  - `“We have come to believe in Allah, the Only One, and we reject all what we had associated (with Allah in His Divinity).”`

## Ayat 85

- `But their believing after they had seen Our chastisement did not avail them.`
- `That has been Allah's Way concerning His servants.`
- `And the unbelievers courted utter loss, then and there.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Allah’s established way”: the Law that repentance and faith are beneficial only till the time man is not seized by the torment of Allah or death.
  - Believing or repenting after the torment has arrived or the signs of death have appeared, is not acceptable to Allah.
