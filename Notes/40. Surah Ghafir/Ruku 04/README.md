**Ayat 28 - 37**

## Ayat 28

- `Then a man endowed with faith, from Pharaoh's folk, who had kept his faith hidden, said:`
  - `“Do you kill a person simply because he says:`
    - `'My Lord is Allah'`
  - `even though he brought to you clear Signs from your Lord?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, He has shown such manifest signs to you as have made it absolutely clear that he is a Messenger sent by your Lord. The Believer, from among the people of Pharaoh, was obviously referring to the signs the details of which have already been given in(Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 107-117, 130-133); (Surah Bani-Israil, Ayats 101-102); (Surah TaHa, Ayats 56-73);(Surah Ash-Shuara, Ayats 30-51); (Surah An-Naml, Ayats 10-13).
  - `If he is a liar, his lying will recoil upon him;`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, if in spite of such manifest signs as he has shown you, you regard him as a liar, you should leave him alone, for the alternative probability, and a very strong probability too, is that he is truthful, and therefore you may involve yourselves in God’s torment by laying your hands on him. Therefore, even if you think that he is a liar, you should leave him to himself. For if he is lying, in the name of Allah, Allah Himself will take him to task.
      - Similar words had the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) himself said to Pharaoh before this: If you do not believe in me, do not harm me. (Surah Ad-Dukhan, Ayat 21).
  - `but if he is truthful, you will be smitten with some of the awesome consequences of which he warns you.`
- `Allah does not guide to the Right Way any who exceeds the limits and is an utter liar.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here one should keep in mind that the Believer of the people of Pharaoh had not openly disclosed in the beginning that he had affirmed faith in the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him), but he spoke as if he also belonged to Pharaoh’s side, and was only wishing his people well.
    - But when Pharaoh and his courtiers did not seem to see reason and continued to behave stubbornly, he at last disclosed the secret of his faith, as becomes obvious from his speech in( verses 38-44).

## Ayat 29

- `My people, today the kingdom is yours, and you are supreme in the land.`
- `But if Allah's chastisement were to come upon you, who will come to our help?”`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, why are you being ungrateful to Allah for His blessing of granting you domination in the land and are inviting His scourge to visit you?
- `Pharaoh said:`
  - `“I only counsel what I consider right;`
  - `I only direct you to the Path of Rectitude.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - From this answer of Pharaoh it appears that he had not yet found out that the noble of his court had become a Believer in his heart. That is why he did not show any displeasure at what he said, but made clear that he was not inclined to change his opinion even after hearing what he had to say.

## Ayat 30

- `He who had faith said:`
  - `“My people, I fear that you will confront a day like that which overtook many parties before you,`

## Ayat 31

- `like the day that overtook the people of Noah and Ad and Thamud, and those who came after them.`
- `Allah does not wish to subject His servants to any injustice.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, Allah has no enmity with His servants that He should destroy them without any reason. He sends calamities upon them only when they have transgressed all limits, and sending the torment then is the very demand of justice.

## Ayat 32

- `My people, I fear that you will encounter a day when there will be much wailing and you will cry out to one another for help,`

## Ayat 33

- `the day when you will turn around to retreat,`
- `there will be none to protect you from Allah.`
- `He whom Allah lets go astray, none will be able to show him the Right Way.`

## Ayat 34

- `Verily Joseph came to you with Clear Signs before,`
- `yet you continued to doubt his Message.`
- `Thereafter when he died, you said:`
  - `'Allah shall send no Messenger after him.'”`
- `Thus Allah leads astray those who transgress the limits and are given to much doubting;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, your deviation, and then your stubbornness, is such that before Moses (peace be upon him), there came in your land the Prophet Joseph (peace be upon him) about whom you yourselves admit that he was a man of the highest morals, and you also admit that by giving the right interpretation of the king’s dream he saved you from the dreadful effects of the seven year long famine, which had struck Egypt in his time, and your entire nation also acknowledges that Egypt has never witnessed a period of greater justice and prosperity than the period of his rule.
  - But in spite of knowing and recognizing all his merits and high qualities you did not believe in him during his life time, and when he died, you said: Never will the like of him came again! That is, you recognized his excellences only for an excuse to deny every prophet who came after him. This means that you would not accept guidance in any case.

## Ayat 35

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It so appears that the next few sentences are an addition by Allah and an explanation of the words of the Believer of the people of Pharaoh.

- `those who contend regarding Allah's Signs without any evidence that might have come to them.`
- `That is exceedingly loathsome to Allah and to those that believe.`
- `Thus does Allah seal the heart of everyone who is proud and high-handed.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, Allah allows only those people to go astray who possess the following three qualities:
    - (1) They transgress all limits in their evil doing, and then develop such a taste for it that they do not feel inclined to accept any invitation to reform their morals.

## Ayat 36

- `Pharaoh said:`
  - `“Haman, build for me a lofty tower that I may scale the highways`

## Ayat 37

- `the highways to the heavens`
- `and have a look at the God of Moses,`
- `although I am certain that Moses is a liar.”`
- `Thus Pharaoh's evil deed was made to seem fair to him, and he was barred from the Right Path.`
- `Pharaoh's guile only led him to his own perdition.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Pharaoh addresses these words to Haman, his minister, interposing in the speech of the Believer in a way as though he has no regard for what he was saying. Therefore, he turns away from him arrogantly and says to Haman: Build me a high tower so that I may climb it to see where the God of whom this Moses speaks, lives.
    - (For explanation, see( Surah Al-Qasas, Ayat 38) and E.Ns thereof).
