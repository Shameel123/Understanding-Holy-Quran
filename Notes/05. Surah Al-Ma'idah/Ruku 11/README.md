**Ayat 78 - 86**


## Ayat 78

- `Those of the Children of Israel who took to unbelief`
- `have been cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary,`
- `for they rebelled and exceeded the bounds of right.`

## Ayat 79

- `They did not forbid each other from committing the abominable deeds they committed.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The corruption of any nation begins with that of a few individuals.
    - If the collective conscience of that nation is alive, the pressure of public opinion keeps those persons in check and prevents the nation as a whole from becoming corrupted.
    - But if instead of censuring such individuals, the nation leaves them free to behave corruptly, the corruption originally confined to a few continues to spread till it engulfs the whole nation.
    - It was this which ultimately caused the degeneration of Israel.
      - (For the curse against Israel in the words of David and Jesus see Psalms 10, 50 and Matthew 23.)
- `Indeed what they did was evil.`


## Ayat 80

- `And now you can see many of them taking the unbelievers (instead of the believers) for their allies.`
- `Indeed they have prepared evil for themselves.`
- `Allah is angry with them, and they shall abide in chastisement.`

## Ayat 81

- `For had they truly believed in`
  - `Allah and`
  - `the Messenger and`
  - `what was sent down to him,`
- `they would not have taken unbelievers (instead of believers) for their allies.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It seems natural that those who believe in God and the Prophets and the Scriptures, compared with the polytheists, would naturally be more sympathetic to those who at least share with them belief in God, in prophethood and in .revelation (whatever their disagreements on other religious issues).
    - It was ironic, therefore, that the Jews should openly support the polytheists in the struggle between polytheism and monotheism, and that their sympathies in the conflict between those who rejected prophethood and those who believed in it should lie expressly with the former. Despite all this, they brazenly claimed to be true believers in God, in the Prophets and in the Scriptures.
- `But many of them have rebelled against Allah altogether.`


## Ayat 82

- `Of all men you will find the Jews and those who associate others with Allah in His divinity to be the most hostile to those who believe;`
- `and you will surely find that of all people they who say: 'We are Christians',`
  - Note: I changed *of ail people* to *of all people*.
- `are closest to feeling affection for those who believe.`
- `This is because there are worshipful priests and monks among them, and because they are not arrogant.`


## Ayat 83

- `And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger`
- `you see that their eyes overflow with tears because of the Truth that they recognize and they say:`
  - `'Our Lord! We do believe; write us down, therefore, with those who bear witness (to the Truth).`


## Ayat 84

- `And why should we not believe in Allah and the Truth which has come down to us`
- `when we do fervently desire that our Lord include us among the righteous?'`

## Ayat 85

- `So Allah rewarded them for these words with Gardens beneath which rivers flow`
- `so that they would abide there for ever.`
- `Such is the reward of the people who do good.`

## Ayat 86

- `Those who disbelieved and gave the lie to Our signs are rightfully the inmates of the Blazing Flame.`
