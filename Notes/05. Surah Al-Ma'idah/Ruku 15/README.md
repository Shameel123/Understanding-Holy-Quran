**Ayat 109 -115**

## Ayat 109

- `The Day when Allah will gather together the Messengers and say:`
  - `'What answer were you given?'`
- `They will reply:`
  - `'We have no real knowledge of it. You alone fully know all that lies beyond the reach of human perception.`

## Ayat 110

- `Imagine, then, when Allah will say:`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The initial question would be addressed to all Prophets as such.
    - Then each of them would be called upon to bear witness separately, as stated in several places in the Qur'an.
    - In this connection the question that will be addressed to Jesus is specifically mentioned here.
- `'Jesus, son of Mary, recall My favour upon you and your mother,`
- `and when I strengthened you with the spirit of holiness so that you talked to men in the cradle and also when you became of age;`
- `and when I taught you the Book and Wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel;`
- `and when, by My leave, you fashioned from clay the likeness of a bird and you breathed into it, and by My leave it became a bird;`
- `you healed, by My leave, the blind from birth and the leprous;`
- `and when, by My leave, you caused the dead to come to life.`
- `And recall when I restrained the Israelites from you when you came to them with clear proofs whereupon those of them who disbelieved said:`
  - `"This is nothing but clear magic."`


## Ayat 111

- `And recall when I revealed to the disciples to believe in Me and in My Mes-senger,`
- `they said:`
  - `"We do believe, and we bear witness that we indeed are the ones who submit to Allah"`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Jesus is being told that the faith of the disciples in him was also the result of God's grace and succour, for he, himself, did not have the power to produce even one man of faith in that land of disbelief.
      - It is also made clear that the true religion of the disciples of Jesus was Islam.


## Ayat 112

### Overview
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Since the disciples have been mentioned here, the continuity of the subject is interrupted momentarily in order to introduce another incident connected with the disciples.
  - This clearly shows that those who had been directly instructed by Jesus considered him merely a human being and a slave of God; they had no conception of their master either being God or a partner of God or the son of God.
  - Jesus had, rather, presented himself to them as a slave of God with no claims to divine authority.
  - One might feel inclined here to raise the question: What is the occasion for this parenthetical interjection in a conversation that is to take place on the Day of Judgement?
  - This parenthesis, in my opinion, is not in fact part of such a conversation, but rather forms part of a discussion in this world regarding a conversation that will take place on the Day of Judgement.
  - The conversation that will take place on the Day of Judgement is mentioned here precisely in order that the Christians may derive a lesson from it and direct themselves to the right way.
  - Hence, the mention of this incident regarding the disciples - even though it seems to interrupt the continuity of narration - is in no sense out of place.That is, are Muslims - Ed.


- `Also recall when the disciples asked Jesus, son of Mary:`
  - `'Jesus, son of Mary, has your Lord the power to send down to us a repast from the heaven?'`
- `There- upon Jesus said:`
  - **`'Fear Allah if you do indeed have faith.'`**


## Ayat 113

- `They said:`
  - `'We desire to partake of it that our hearts be satisfied and we know that you did speak the truth to us, and that we are its witnesses.'`

## Ayat 114

- `Jesus, son of Mary, then prayed:`
  - `'O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a repast from the heavens that shall be a festival for the first of us and for the last of us, and a sign from You. And provide us with sustenance, for You are the best Provider of sustenance.'`

## Ayat 115

### Overview
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Qur'an is silent on the question of whether this meal was sent down in response to this prayer. There is also no other authoritative basis to help us arrive at a clear conclusion. It is possible that the repast was actually sent down. It is also possible that the disciples withdrew their prayer after hearing the stern warning in response to it.

- `Allah said:`
  - `'I shall indeed send it down to you;`
  - `then, I shall afflict whoever among you who disbelieves with a chastisement wherewith I will afflict none in the worlds.'`
