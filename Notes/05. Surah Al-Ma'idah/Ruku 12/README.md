**Ayat 87 - 93**


## Ayat 87

- `Believers!`
- `Do not hold as unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful to you,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This verse embodies two directives.
    - The first is that man should not attribute to himself the authority to proclaim things either lawful or unlawful according to his own wishes.
      - Only that which God has held to be lawful is lawful, and only that which God has declared unlawful is unlawful.
      - If men were to declare certain things either lawful or unlawful on their own authority, they would not be following the law of God but their own laws.
    - The second directive is that they should not adopt the course of world-renunciation and abstention from worldly pleasures as the Christian monks, Hindu mendicants, Buddhist bhikshus and illuminist mystics did. Religious-minded and virtuous people have always tended to consider their physical and carnal desires an impediment to spiritual growth. They have considered suffering, deprivation from worldly pleasures and abstention from the means of worldly sustenance to be acts of goodness and indispensable for achieving proximity to God.
    - Even some of the Companions leaned in this direction. The Prophet (peace be on him) once came to know that some Companions had resolved that they would fast without interruption, that instead of spending the night on their beds they would remain awake praying, that they would consume neither meat nor fat, and would have no (sexual) relations with women. The Prophet (peace be on him) addressed the people on this subject and said: **'I have not been commanded to do so. Even your own self has rights against you. So, fast on certain days and refrain from fasting on others. Stay awake praying at night and also sleep. Look at me; 1 sleep as well as stay awake (praying); sometimes I fast and sometimes I don't. I consume meat as well as fat. Whosoever dislikes my way does not belong to me.'** He then added: **'What has happened to people that they have prohibited for themselves women, good food, perfumes, sleep and the pleasures of the world, whereas I have not taught you to become monks and priests. In my religion there is neither abstention from women nor from meat, neither seclusion nor withdrawal.For the purposes of self-control my religion has fasting. As for monasticism, all its benefits can be derived from jihad (struggle in the way of God). Serve God and associate none with Him. Perform Hajj and 'Umrah, establish Prayers, dispense Zakah and observe the fasts of Ramadan. Those who were destroyed before you were destroyed because they were severe with themselves, and when they became severe with themselves God became severe with them as well. It is the remnants of such people who you see in the oratories and hermitages of monks.'** 
      - (Ibn Kathir, vol. 2, pp. 626 and 628-9 - Ed.)
    - There are traditions to the effect that the Prophet (peace be on him) once came to know that one of his Companions was always so preoccupied with worship and devotion that he did not approach his wife for long periods. The Prophet (peace be on him) called for him and directed him to go to his wife. On being told that he was fasting, the Prophet (peace be on him) asked him to break the fast and proceed to his wife.
    - During the reign of 'Umar a lady once lodged the complaint that her husband fasted all day and prayed all night and had no relations with her. 'Umar appointed the famous Successor (Tabi'i), Ka'b b. Thawr al-Azdi to look into the matter. He issued the judgement that the husband had the right to spend three nights in Prayer if he so wished, but every fourth night was the right of his wife. (Fiqh al-Sunnah, vol. 2, p. 164 - Ed.)
- `and do not exceed the bounds of right.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - 'Do not exceed the bounds of right' has a broad signification.
    - To hold the things which are lawful to be unlawful, and to shun the things declared by God to be clean as if they were unclean, is in itself an act of wrongful excess.
    - It should be remembered, at the same time, that extravagant indulgence even in clean things is an act of wrongful excess.
    - Likewise, to overstep the limits of the permissible is also an act of wrongful excess. 
    - God disapproves of all three kinds of excess.
- `Allah does not love those who transgress the bounds of right.`


## Ayat 88

- `And partake of the lawful, good things which Allah has provided you as sustenance,`
- `and refrain from disobeying Allah in Whom you believe.`

## Ayat 89

- `Allah does not take you to task for the oaths you utter vainly,`
- `but He will certainly take you to task for the oaths you have sworn in earnest.`
- `The expiation (for breaking such oaths) is either to feed ten needy persons with more or less the same food as you are wont to give to your families, or to clothe them, or to set free from bondage the neck of one man; and he who does not find the means shall fast for three days.`
- `This shall be the expiation for your oaths whenever you have sworn (and broken them.)`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Since some people had taken an oath prohibiting for themselves the things which He had permitted, God laid down this injunction regarding oaths made inadvertently.
    - The injunction makes it unnecessary to feel bound by the terms of inadvertent oaths, and for which one will not be reproached by God.
    - And if a person had deliberately made an oath which entails sin he should not abide by his oath and should expiate it (see Towards Understanding the Qur'an, vol. I, (Surah 2,nn. 243-4); for expiation see(Surah 4, n. 125) above.
- `But do keep your oaths.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - To be mindful of one's oaths has several meanings. 
    - First, one should make proper use of oaths and should not employ them either frivolously or sinfully.
    - Second, when a person takes an oath, he should take care not to forget it lest he be led to break it.
    - Third, when a man deliberately takes an oath regarding something sound in itself he should pay the penalty if he happens to violate it.
- `Thus does Allah make clear to you His commandments;`
- `maybe you will be grateful.`

## Ayat 90

- `Believers!`
  - `Intoxicants,`
  - `games of chance,`
  - `idolatrous sacrifices at altars,`
  - `and divining arrows`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - For 'altars' and divination by arrows see (nn.12 )and 14 )above.
      - For games of chance see (n. 14) above.
      - While divination by arrow-shooting essentially constitutes a game of chance there is nevertheless a certain difference between the two, since divination by arrow-shooting, in addition to being a game of chance, is also tainted with polytheistic beliefs and superstitions. As for games of chance, this expression is applied to those games and acts in which accidental factors are considered the criteria for acquisition, fortune-making and the division of goods and property.
- `are all abominations, the handiwork of Satan.`
- `So turn wholly away from it that you may attain to true success.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this verse four things are categorically prohibited:
        1. intoxicants;
        2. games of chance; 
        3. places consecrated for the worship of anyone else besides God, and altars for either sacrifices or offerings in the name of others than God;
        4. polytheistic divination by arrow-shooting.
      - The last three items have already been explained.
        - (See Towards Understanding the Qur'an, vol. I,( Surah 2: 219, n. 235 )and (Surah 5: 3, n. 14 above).
      - Two injunctions had already been revealed concerning the prohibition of intoxicants See(Surahs 2: 219 )and( 4: 43).
      - Before the revelation of the last injunction, the Prophet (peace be on him) had warned the people that intoxicants were highly displeasing to God. Hinting at the possibility of their being prohibited, he advised people to dispose of intoxicants if they had any. A little later on the present verse was revealed and the Prophet (peace be on him) then proclaimed that those who had intoxicants should neither consume nor sell them, but rather destroy them. Intoxicating liquors were poured into the streets of Madina. When asked if such liquor might be offered to the Jews as a gift the Prophet (peace be on him) replied in the negative and said: **'He Who has prohibited it has also required it not to be given away as a gift.'** 
      - Some people inquired whether it was permitted to make vinegar out of such liquor. The Prophet (peace be on him) told them not to do so, but to throw it away instead.
      - Another person asked insistently whether or not an intoxicant could be used as medicine. The Prophet (peace be on him) replied that far from being a remedy for any malady it was in itself a malady.
      - Others sought permission to consume intoxicating liquor on the plea that they lived in a very cold region and had to work very hard, and that the people of that region habitually drank intoxicants to combat exhaustion and cold. The Prophet (peace be on him) inquired if the drink concerned did cause intoxication. On being told that it did, he said that they should abstain from it. They pointed out that the people of their region would not accept this, to which the Prophet (peace be on him) replied that they should fight them.It is reported by 'Abd Allah Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet (peace be on him) said: **'God has cursed khamr (wine) and him who drinks it, him who provides it to others and him who buys or sells it, him who squeezes (the grapes) into wine and him who causes others to squeeze grapes (in order to make wine), him who carries it and him to whom it is carried.'** 
        - (See Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 2, p. 97; vol. 1, p. 316; Abu Da'ud, 'Ashribah', 2 - Ed.)
      - According to another tradition the Prophet (peace be on him) instructed not to eat at the table where intoxicating drinks were being taken. In the beginning the Prophet (peace be on him) even forbade the use of vessels in which intoxicating drinks had either been made or served. Later on, when the prohibition of drinks was completely observed the Prophet (peace be on him) withdrew the interdiction regarding the use of these vessels. 
        - (See Abu Da'ud, 'At'imah', 18; Tirmidhi, 'Adab', 43; Darimi, 'Ashribah', 15; Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 1, p. 20; vol. 3, p. 339 - Ed.)
      - Though the word khamr in Arabic means literally 'the drink made from grapes', it was also used figuratively for intoxicating liquors made from wheat, barley, raisins, dates and honey. The Prophet (peace be on him) applied the prohibition of wine to all intoxicants. In this regard we find categorical statements from the Prophet (peace be on him) embodied in traditions: 'Every intoxicant is khamr, and every intoxicant is prohibited.' 'Every drink which causes intoxication is prohibited.' 'I forbid everything which intoxicates.' In a Friday sermon 'Umar defined khamr in the following manner: 'Whatever takes hold of the mind is khamr.' 
        - (See Bukhari, 'Wudu", 71; 'Maghazi', 60, 'Ashribah', 4,10, 'Adab', 8, 'Ahkam', 22; Muslim, 'Ashribah', 67-9; Abu Da'ud, 'Ashribah', 5, 71; Ibn Majah, 'Ashribah', 9, 13, 14; Darimi, 'Ashribah', 8, 9; Muwatta', 'Dahaya', 8; Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 1, pp. 274, 289, 350; vol. 2, pp. 16, 158, 171, 185, 429, 501; vol. 3, pp. 63, 66, 112, 119, 361; vol. 4, pp. 41, 416; vol. 6, pp. 36, 71, 72, 97, 131, 190 and 226 - Ed.)
      - The Prophet (peace be on him) also enunciated the following principle: **'If anything causes intoxication when used in large quantity, even a small quantity of it is prohibited.'** **'If a large quantity of something causes intoxication, to drink even a palmful of it is prohibited.'** 
        - (See Abu Da'ud, 'Ashribah', 5; Ibn Majah, 'Ashribah', 10; Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 2, pp. 167, 179 and vol. 3, p. 343 - Ed.)
      - In the time of the Prophet (peace be on him) no specific punishment had been laid down for drinking. A person caught drunk would be struck with shoes, fists, and whips made of twisted cloth and palm sticks. The maximum number of lashes to which any culprit was subjected was forty. In the time of Abu Bakr the punishment continued to be forty lashes. In the time of 'Umar the punishment initially remained at forty lashes also, but when he saw people persist in drinking he fixed the punishment at eighty lashes after consulting the Companions. This was considered the prescribed legal punishment for drinking by Malik and Abu Hanifah, and even by Shafi'i according to one tradition. But Ahmad b. Hanbal, and, according to a variant tradition, Shafi'i, considered the punishment to consist of forty lashes, and 'Ali is reported to have preferred this opinion.
      - According to Islamic Law, it is the bounden duty of an Islamic government to enforce this prohibition.
      - In the time of 'Umar the shop of a member of the Thaqif tribe, by the name of Ruwayshid, was burnt down because he carried on the sale of liquor. On another occasion a whole hamlet was set on fire because it had become a center of illegal traffic in liquor.
