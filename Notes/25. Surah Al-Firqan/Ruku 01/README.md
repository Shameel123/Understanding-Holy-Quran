**Ayat  01 - 09**


## Ayat 1

- `Most blessed is He`
- `Who sent down this Criterion on His servant,`
- `to be a warner to all mankind;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Arabic word tabaraka is very comprehensive, and cannot be understood fully and completely by “blessed”, not even by a sentence. However, its meanings may be grasped by keeping in view the remaining portion of (verses 1-2). Here it has been used to convey the following meanings:
    1. **He is the most Beneficent**: that is why He has bestowed the great blessing of Al-Furqan by degrees on His servant so that he may admonish all mankind.
    2. **He is the most Exalted and Great**: for the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth belongs to Him.
    3. **He is the most Holy, Pure and Perfect**: He is free from every tinge of shirk and has neither a partner in His Godhead, nor needs a son to succeed Him; for He is Ever- Lasting.


## Ayat 2

- `He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “To Him belongs the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth.” That is, He alone has an exclusive right to it, and no one else has any right to it nor any share in it.
- `Who has taken to Himself no son`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, He has neither any relation of direct parenthood to anyone, nor has He taken anyone as a son. Therefore, none else in the universe is entitled to worship. He is Unique and there can be no partner in His Godhead. Thus all those who associate with Him angels or jinns or saints as His offspring, are ignorant. Likewise, those who believe that someone is His son, are also ignorant. They have no true conception of the Greatness of Allah and consider Him to be weak and needy like human beings, who require someone to become their inheritor. It is sheer ignorance and folly. For further details, see (E.Ns 66 to 68 of Surah Younus).
- `nor has He taken any partner in His kingdom;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Arabic word mulk means Sovereignty, Supreme Authority, and Kingship. Thus the sentence will mean: **Allah is the Absolute Ruler of the whole universe and there is none other who may have any right to authority; therefore He alone is God.**
    - For, whenever a man takes anything else as his lord, he does so under the presumption that his deity has the power to do good or bring harm and make or mar his fortune; nobody will like to worship a powerless deity. Now when it is recognized that none but Allah has the real power and authority in the universe, nobody will bow before anyone other than Him in worship, nor will sing anybody else’s hymns, nor commit the folly of bowing in worship before anything else except his real God, or recognize any other as his ruler, because **“To Allah belongs the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and to Him alone.”**
- `Who created everything and then determined its destiny.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - There may be other translations of this also: He has ordained it in due proportion; or He has appointed an exact measure for everything. But no translation can convey its real meaning, which is: **Allah has not only created everything in the universe but also determined its shape, size, potentialities, characteristics, term of existence, the limitations and extent of its development and all other things concerning it. Then, He has created the means and provisions to enable it to function properly in its own separate sphere.**

## Ayat 3

- `Yet people have taken, instead of Him, other deities;`
- `those that create nothing but are themselves created;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The words are comprehensive and cover all the false gods whom the mushriks worship whether they are angels, jinns, Prophets, saints, the sun, the moon, the stars, trees, rivers, animals etc., which have been created by Allah, or those which have been created by man, as the idols of stone, wood, etc.
- `who do not have the power to hurt or benefit even themselves;`
- `who have no power over death, nor over life, nor over the resurrection of the dead.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Allah has sent down Al-Furqan on His servant so that he may invite the people to the truth, which they have forsaken due to heedlessness and waywardness, and warn them of the evil consequences of their folly. The Furqan is being revealed piecemeal so that he may distinguish right from wrong and the genuine from the counterfeit.

## Ayat 4

- `Those who disbelieve in the Message of the Prophet say:`
  - `"This (Criterion) is nothing but a lie which he has forged with the help of others."`
- **`Such have indeed resorted to a grievous wrong and sheer falsehood.`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Another translation may be: a great injustice.

## Ayat 5

- `They say:`
  - `"These are merely fairy tales of the ancients which he has got inscribed and they are then recited to him morning and evening."`

## Ayat 6

- `Say to them (O Muhammad):`
  - `"It is He Who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This is the same objection which the modern orientalists have raised against the Quran, but strange as it may seem, no contemporary of the Prophet (peace be upon him) ever raised such an objection against him.
      - Nobody, for instance, ever said that Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a boy had met Buhairah, the monk, and had attained religious knowledge from him, nor did anybody claim that he had obtained all that information from the Christian monks and Jewish rabbis during the trade journeys in his youth.
      - In fact, they knew that he had never traveled alone but in the caravans and if they said such a thing, it would be refuted by hundreds of their own people from the city.
  - `Who has sent down this Book.`
  - `Indeed, He is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate."`


  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Then, one could ask, if he had gained all that knowledge from Buhairah when he was about 12, and during trade journeys when he was 25, why did he keep it secret from the people till he became 40?
    - Whereas he did not leave his country even for a single day, but lived for years among his own people in the same city. That is why the people of Makkah dared not bring such an impudent and baseless charge against him. Their objections related to the time when he claimed to be a Prophet (peace be upon him) of Allah and not to the time preceding that claim.
    - Their argument was like this: **This man is illiterate and cannot obtain any knowledge through books.**
    - He has lived among us for forty years, but we have never heard from him anything that might have shown that he had any acquaintance with what he is preaching; therefore he must have had the help of other people who copied these things from the writings of the ancients for him: he learns these things from them and recites them as divine revelations: this is a fraud.
    - So much so that according to some traditions, they named some of his helpers, who were the people of the Book, were illiterate and lived in Makkah. They were:
      1. Addas, a freed slave of Huvaitib bin Abdul Uzza.
      2. Yasar, a freed slave of Ala bin Al Hadrami.
      3. Jabr, a freed slave of Amir bin Rabbiah.

## Ayat 7

- `They say:`
  - `"What sort of a Messenger is this: he eats food and walks about in the markets?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, he cannot be a Messenger of Allah because he is a human being like us. Had Allah willed to send a Messenger, He would have sent an angel, and if at all a human being was to be sent, he should have been a king or a millionaire, who would have resided in a castle and been guarded by attendants.
      - A Messenger could not be an ordinary person who has to move about in the market places like the common people, for it is obvious that such a human Messenger cannot attract the attention of the people. In other words, they thought that a Messenger was not meant to guide the people to the right path but to coerce them to obedience by show of worldly power and grandeur. For details, see (E.N. 26 of Surah Al-Mominoon).
  - `Why was an angel not sent down to him so that he may remain with the Messenger and warn those that do not believe in him?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, if a human being was to be sent as a Messenger, an angel should have been appointed to accompany him to proclaim: If you do not believe in him, I will scourge you. But what kind of a Messenger is he, who has to suffer from abuse and persecution?

## Ayat 8

- `Why was a treasure not bestowed upon him, or a garden whereof he might obtain his sustenance?"`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, if nothing else, Allah should at least have made extraordinary arrangements for his livelihood. But this man has no treasure and no gardens; yet he claims to be a Messenger of the Lord of the universe.
- `The evil-doers say:`
  - `"You are simply following a bewitched man."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The disbelievers of Makkah made the false propaganda against the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he had been bewitched by some jinn or by the sorcery of an enemy or by the curse of some god or goddess for his insolence.
      - But it is strange that they also admitted that he was a clever man who could make use of extracts from the ancient writings for the sake of his prophethood, could practice sorcery and was also a poet.

## Ayat 9

- `See what specious arguments they put forth before you:`
- `they are so strayed that they will not find their way to anything sound.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - As these objections were frivolous and meaningless like others, the Quran has ignored them, saying: Your objections are irrelevant, unreasonable and void of sense. You bring no sound argument to prove your doctrine of shirk, or to refute the doctrine of Tauhid put forward by him, whereas the Messenger gives such proofs of the doctrine of Tauhid that you cannot refute them except by saying: He is bewitched.
  - The same is true of the doctrine of the life-after-death and of the moral system of the Quran, which has produced men of high character. You cannot deny these things; you reject them, saying, He is a human being like us, etc.
