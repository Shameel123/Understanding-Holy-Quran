**Ayat 68 - 89**

## Ayat 68

- `(It will be said to them):`
  - `“My servants, today you have nothing to fear or regret,` 

## Ayat 69

- `you who believed in Our Signs and had surrendered yourselves (to Us)!`

## Ayat 70

- `Enter Paradise joyfully,`
- `both you and your spouses.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The word azwaj as used in the original can be used both for the wives and for those people who are a person’s close associates, friends and peers. This comprehensive word has been used so as to cover both the meanings. The believers will be accompanied both by their believing wives and by their believing friends in Paradise.

## Ayat 71

- `Platters and cups of gold shall be passed around them,`
- `and there shall be all that they might desire`
- `and all that their eyes might delight in.`
- `(They shall be told):`
  - `“Herein shall you abide for ever.`

## Ayat 72

- `Such is the Paradise that you shall inherit by virtue of your good deeds in the life of the world.`

## Ayat 73

- `Herein you will have abundant fruits of which you will eat.”`

## Ayat 74

- `But the evil-doers shall abide in the torment of Hell.`


## Ayat 75

- `Never will their torment be lightened for them.`
- `They shall remain in utter despair.`

## Ayat 76

- `It is not We Who wronged them;`
- `rather, it is they who wronged themselves.`

## Ayat 77

- `They shall call out:`
  - `“O Malik, let your Lord put an end to us.”`
- `He will reply:`
  - `“You must stay on in it.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Malik: a keeper of Hell as is evident from the context.

## Ayat 78

- `We brought you the Truth;`
- `but to the truth most of you were averse.”`

- Tahafim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, We made the reality plain to you, but you were fond of the imaginary, and you had an aversion to the truth. Now, why do you lament at the fate of your foolish choice?
  - It may be a part of the Hell-keeper’s answer, and it may also be that his answer ended with: Here you must remain, and this second sentence as an addition by Allah.
  - In the first case, the keeper’s saying: We had brought the Truth to you, is just like an official’s using the word “we” on behalf of his government, when he wants to say: Our government did this or gave such and such an order.

## Ayat 79

- `Have they contrived some scheme?`
- `If so, We too will contrive a scheme.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The allusion is to the plans that the chiefs of the Quraish were devising in their secret assemblies in order to take a decisive action against the Prophet (peace be upon him).

## Ayat 80

- `Or do they think that We do not hear their secret talks and their whispering counsels?`
- `Yes, indeed We do and Our messengers [i.e., angels) are with them, writing.`

## Ayat 81

- `Say:`
  - `“If the Merciful One had a son, I would have been the first one to worship him.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It means: My rejection of somebody’s being God’s offspring and my refusal to worship those whom you regard as His offspring is not due to any stubbornness and obduracy. My reason for the refusal is only this that God has no son or daughter, and your such beliefs are against the reality; otherwise I am such a faithful servant of my Lord that if at all the reality had been the same as you state I would have submitted myself in worship before you.


## Ayat 82

- **`Exalted be the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne, above what they attribute to Him.`**


## Ayat 83

- `So leave them alone to indulge in their vanities and to frolic about`
- `until they encounter that Day of theirs against which they have been warned.`

## Ayat 84

- **`He it is Who is God in the heavens and the earth.`**
- **`He is the Most Wise, the All-Knowing.`**

## Ayat 85

- `Blessed is He Who has dominion over the heavens and the earth and all that is between them.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, He is far above it that another should be His associate in Godhead and may have any share whatsoever in ruling this great universe.
    - Whatever is there in the earth and the heavens, whether the Prophets, the saints, the angels, jinn, spirits, stars or planets, they are His servants and slaves and subjects. It is impossible for them to be characterized with a divine attribute or be possessed with a divine power.
- `With Him is the knowledge of the Hour; and to Him you shall all be sent back.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you may have taken anyone as your helper and patron in the world, but after death you will have to face only One God and render an account of your deeds before Him alone.

## Ayat 86

- `Those whom they call upon, instead of Allah have no power of intercession,`
- `except such that testify to the truth based on knowledge.`

## Ayat 87

- `If you were to ask them:`
  - `“Who created them?”`
- `they will surely say:`
  - `“Allah.”`
- `Whence are they, then, being led astray?`

## Ayat 88

- `We call to witness the cry of the Messenger:`
  - `“O Lord, these are a people not wont to believe!”`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is one of the most difficult verses of the Quran as it involves the complicated syntactic question of the kind of **waw** that has been used in **wa qili-hi**. From the translation of Shah Abdul Qadir it appears that the waw here is not conjunctive but for taking oath, and is related to fa-anna yu-fakun, and the pronoun in qili-hi turns to the Prophet (peace be upon him) of Allah.
  - Therefore, the verse means this: By this saying of the Messenger: O my Lord, these are a people who would not believe. They are so utterly deluded that although they themselves admit that Allah alone is their Creator and Creator of their gods, yet they abandon the Creator and persist in worshiping His creatures.

## Ayat 89

- `Indulge them, (O Prophet), and say to them: “Peace to you.”1 For soon they shall come to know.`
