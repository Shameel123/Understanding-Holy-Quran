**Ayat 46 - 56**

## Ayat 46

- `Indeed We sent Moses with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his nobles.`
- `He told them:`
  - `“I am a Messenger of the Lord of the Universe.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This story has been narrated here for three objects:
    - (1) That when Allah sends His Prophet to a country and nation and affords it the opportunity which He has now given to the Arabs by appointing the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to Prophethood, and it, instead of taking advantage of this, commits the folly of Pharaoh and his people, it meets the same fate which has become an object lesson in history.

## Ayat 47

- `Yet when he brought forth Clear Signs from Us,`
- `then lo, they burst into laughter.`

## Ayat 48

- `Every Sign that We showed them was greater than its predecessor;`
- `and then We seized them with Our chastisement so that they may return (to the Right Way).`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This implies the signs which Allah showed them through the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) afterwards, and these were the following:

## Ayat 49

- `(Whenever they faced an affliction) they would say:`
  - `“O magician, pray for us to your Lord according to your station with Him. We shall certainly be guided to the Right Way.”`

## Ayat 50

- `But lo, each time We removed Our affliction from them,`
- `they would go back on their word.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The stubbornness of Pharaoh and the chiefs of his people can be judged from the fact that when distressed by the torment they wanted the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) to pray for its removal, even then they did not recognize him as a Prophet but addressed him as a magician, whereas they were not unaware of the truth about magic, and they also knew that those miraculous things could not be brought about by the power of magic. The most that a magician can do is that in a limited area he can so influence the people present in front of him as to make them feel that water has become blood, or frogs are coming out in large numbers or swarms of locusts are advancing. And within this limited place also no water will actually become blood, but water will remain water as soon as it comes outside it; no frog will be produced in actual fact, but will prove to be an imaginary thing as soon as brought outside the circle; locusts also would be imaginary: they would not be able to destroy any crop.
  - As for this that a famine appears throughout a country, or that the canals and springs and wells of the country are filled with blood, or that swarms of locusts spread over thousands of square miles and eat up crops growing over thousands of acres, **this has neither been accomplished by a magician so far, nor can it ever happen by the power of magic**.
  - Should such magicians be there in the service of a king, he need not keep forces and fight wars; **he could conquer the whole world by the power of magic**. Even if the magicians possessed such power, they would not seek service under the kings, but would assume kingship themselves.

## Ayat 51

- `And Pharaoh proclaimed among his people:`
  - `“My people, do I not have dominion over Egypt, and are these streams not flowing beneath me? Can't you see?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Pharaoh probably sent heralds to the cities and towns throughout the country to proclaim what he said in his address to his ministers and courtiers in the capital. Pharaoh could not have availed of the services of a sycophantic press, controlled news agencies and official radio.
  - The words of the proclamation clearly show that ground was slipping from under the Pharaoh’s feet. The miracles performed one after the other by the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) had caused the common people’s beliefs in their gods to waver and the Pharaoh’s spell under which their dynasty was ruling over Egypt as representatives of the gods, was shattered. Thereupon, Pharaoh cried out: O wretched people, can’t you see who is ruling over this land and under whose control are the canals which have been dug out from the Nile, upon which depends your whole economy? All these developments in this country have been brought about by me and my predecessors, but you are being devoted, charmed and fascinated by this pauper!

## Ayat 52

- `Am I better or this contemptible man`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Who is despicable: the person who has neither wealth, nor power, nor authority. This same objection had been raised by the disbelieving Quraish against the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
- `who is scarcely able to express himself?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Some commentators have expressed the opinion that Pharaoh referred to the impediment of speech from which the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) suffered since childhood.
    - But this is not a correct opinion. As has been mentioned in Surah TaHa above, when the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) was being appointed to Prophethood, he had implored Allah Almighty to remove the defect from his tongue so that the people might understand his speech and at that very time his request had also been granted along with his other requests (verse 27-36). Moreover, orations of the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) that have been cited at different places in the Quran, point to his perfect eloquence and fluency.
    - **Therefore, the basis of Pharaoh’s objection was not any impediment of speech from which Moses (peace be upon him) might be suffering** but what he meant was: This person talks confusedly, at least I have never been able to understand what he says.

## Ayat 53

- `Why were bracelets of gold not bestowed upon him?`
- `Why did a retinue of angels not accompany him as attendants?”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In the ancient times when a person was appointed to be governor of a land or sent as an ambassador to a foreign country, a robe of honor was conferred on him by the king, which also included bracelets of gold, and he was also accompanied by a contingent of soldiers and servants for over-awing the people and for showing the glory and grandeur of the king who had appointed him.
  - What Pharaoh meant to say was: If the King of the heavens had really sent Moses (peace be upon him) as His ambassador to His counterpart on the earth, he should have been dressed in a robe of honor and come with several contingents of angels in attendance.
  - How strange that a poor man should appear with a staff in his hand and say that he was the messenger of the Lord of the worlds!

## Ayat 54

- `He incited his people to levity and they obeyed him.`
- `Surely they were an iniquitous people.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - A tremendous reality has been expressed in this brief sentence. 
  - When a person wishes to become autocratic in a country and contrives every plan openly to achieve his object, he practices every deception and trick. He buys and sells consciences and persecutes and crushes ruthlessly those who cannot be purchased. He, in fact, shows by his actions, whatever he may say to the contrary, that he takes the people of the country to be light as regards to their intellect, morals and manliness, and has formed the impression that he can drive the foolish, unscrupulous and cowardly people wherever he likes. Then, when he has succeeded in his designs and the people have become his obedient servants, they prove by their conduct and behavior that they are actually what the wicked man had taken them to be, and the main cause of their depravity is that they are basically a sinful people. They are not in the least concerned as to what is the truth and what is falsehood, what is justice and what is injustice, whether the noble traits of character are truthfulness and honesty or falsehood and dishonesty and meanness. Instead of this, only their personal interests are of real importance to them, for the sake of which they remain ever ready to cooperate with every wicked person, to yield to every tyrant, to accept every falsehood and to suppress every protest that is voiced in favor of the truth.

## Ayat 55

- `So when they incurred Our wrath, We exacted retribution from them, and drowned them all,`

## Ayat 56

- `and made them a thing of the past and an example for those who would come after them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, they are a precedent for those who do not learn any lesson from their example, and an object lesson for those who are keen to learn a lesson.
