**Ayat 26 - 35**

## Ayat 26

- `Call to mind when Abraham said to his father and his people:`
  - `“I totally disown all whom you serve`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For details, see(Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayats 124-133); (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayats 74-84); (Surah Ibrahim, Ayats 35- 41);(Surah Maryam, Ayats 41-50);(Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 51-73); (Surah Ash-Shuara, Ayats 69-89),(Surah Al-Ankabut, Ayats 16-27); (Surah As-Saaffat, Ayats 83-100) and the corresponding E.Ns.

## Ayat 27

- `except the One Who created me;`
- `and, behold, it is He Who will direct me to the Right Way.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In these words not only did the Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) state his creed but also gave the argument for it. The reason for not having any connection with the other deities is that they neither have created nor they give right guidance in any matter, nor they can; and the reason for having a connection only with Allah Almighty is that He alone is the Creator and He alone gives, and can give the right guidance to mankind.

## Ayat 28

- `And Abraham left behind this word`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - A word: the word that none but the Creator is worthy of worship in the world.
- `to endure among his posterity so that they may return to it.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, whenever they swerve from the right path, this word should be there to guide them so that they return to it again. This event has been mentioned here in order to expose the foolishness of the disbelieving Quraish and to put them to shame, as if to say: When you have adopted obedience of your ancestors, you have selected the most depraved of them for the purpose instead of the most righteous and illustrious, who were the Prophets Abraham and Ishmael (peace be upon them). The basis of the leadership of the Quraish in Arabia was that they were the descendants of the Prophets Abraham and Ishmael (peace be upon them) and were the attendants of the Kabah built by them. Therefore, they should have followed them and not their ignorant forefathers who had given up the way of the Prophets and adopted polytheism from the neighboring idol-worshipers.
    - Furthermore, by mentioning this event another error of those people has been pointed out. That is, if the blind imitation of the forefathers, without the distinction of good and evil had been the right thing, the Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) should have done so in the first instance. But he had plainly told his father and his people that he could not follow their creed of ignorance in which they had abandoned the Creator and made those imaginary beings their deities, who were not the creator.
    - This shows that the Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) did not believe in following the forefathers, but his creed was that before one followed the forefathers one should see whether they were following the right way or not, and if it became known by reason that they were following the wrong way, one should give up their way and adopt the way that was proved right.

## Ayat 29

- `(Even when they began worshipping others than Allah We did not destroy them) but bestowed sustenance on them and on their forefathers until there came to them the Truth and a Messenger who clearly expounded things to them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Another meaning of the word rasulum-mubin can be: A Messenger whose being a Messenger was obvious and apparent: Whose life before and after the Prophethood clearly testified that he was certainly Allah’s Messenger.

## Ayat 30

- `And when the Truth came to them they said:`
  - `“This is just sorcery and we reject it.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For explanation, see (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayat 3 and E.N. 5) on it, and (E.N. 5 of Surah Suad).

## Ayat 31

- `They say:`
  - `“Why was this Qur'an not sent down upon some great man from the two (main) cities?”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The two towns: **Makkah and Taif**.
  - What the disbelievers meant was: Had Allah really willed to send a messenger and intended to send down a book to him, He would have selected a great man from our these central cities for the purpose. 
  - For Allah could not have selected for this great mission a person who was born an orphan, who did not inherit much property, who passed his youth by tending goats, who even at present earned his living through business with his wife’s money, and who was neither the chief of a tribe nor the head of a family.
  - Were not there well known chiefs like Walid bin Mughirah and Utbah bin Rabiah in Makkah, and nobles like Urwah bin Masud, Habib bin Amr, Kinanah bin Abdi Amr and Ibn Abd Yalil in Taif? This was their reasoning in the first instance, they were also not inclined to believe that a man could be a Messenger. But when the Quran refuted this misconception by argument and reason and they were told that in the past only men had come as Messengers and a man only could be a Messenger for the guidance of the people, and not another kind of being and the Messenger who came did not descend suddenly from heavens but were born in the same ordinary dwellings, walked about in the streets, had children and families and stood in need of food and drink
  - (see(Surah An-Nahl, Ayat 43); (Surah Bani Israil, Ayats 94-95); (Surah Yousuf, Ayat 109);(Surah Al-Furqan, Ayats 7, 20); (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 7-8); (Surah Ar-Raad, Ayat 38),
  - they took this stand, saying: Well, even if a human being, he should be a big man, who should be wealthy, influential and awe-inspiring and having a large following. How could Muhammad bin Abdullah (peace be upon him) be fit for this appointment?)

## Ayat 32

- `Is it they who distribute the Mercy of your Lord?`
- `It is We Who have distributed their livelihood among them in the life of this world, and have raised some above others in rank that some of them may harness others to their service.`
- `Your Lord's Mercy is better than all the treasures that they hoard.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the answer to their objection, which briefly mentions many important things:
    - First, it asks: Since when do these people become responsible for distributing the mercy of your Lord? Is it for them to decide whom Allah should favor with His mercy and whom He should not? (Here, by Allah’s mercy is implied His general mercy from which everyone has a share).

## Ayat 33

- `Were it not that all mankind would become a single community (and follow the same way), We would have provided for all those who disbelieve in the Merciful One silver roofs for their houses, and (silver) stairs on which to go up,`

## Ayat 34

- `and (silver) doors to their houses, and couches (of silver) upon which they would recline;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, this silver and gold whose possession by somebody is the highest blessing and the very climax of good fortune in your sight, is so base and contemptible a thing in the sight of Allah that had there been no danger of all human beings being inclined towards unbelief, He would have made every disbeliever's house of gold and silver.
  - Since when has the abundance of this worthless commodity become proof of man’s nobility and his piety and his spiritual purity? This kind of wealth is even found in the possession of those foul and wicked people whose filthy characters make the whole society stink. And this you have made the criterion of man’s greatness of character.

## Ayat 35

- `or that they be made of gold.`
- `Surely all this is only the enjoyment of the life of the world.`
- `But (true prosperity) in the Hereafter with Your Lord is only for the God-fearing.`
