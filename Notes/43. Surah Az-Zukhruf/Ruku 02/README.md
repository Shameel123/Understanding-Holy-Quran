**Ayat 16 - 25**

## Ayat 16

- `Has Allah taken for Himself daughters out of those whom He creates and has chosen you to have sons?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here, the folly of the polytheists of Arabia has been fully exposed. They said that the angels were the daughters of Allah. They had carved out their images as females, and these were their goddesses whom they worshiped. About this Allah says: In the first place, in spite of knowing and recognizing that the Creator of the earth and heavens is Allah and it is He Who has made this earth a cradle for you and it is He Who sends down the rain from the sky, and it is He Who has created these animals for your service, yet you have taken others as gods beside Him, whereas those whom you serve as deities are not God but creatures of God. Then, further more, you have made some of the servants associates of Allah not only in His attributes but in His Being as well, and invented the creed that they were Allah’s offspring. Then, not resting content with this, you assigned to Allah that kind of the offspring which you regard as disgraceful for your own selves. **When a daughter is born in your house, your face grows dark, you feel distressed, and sometimes you bury her alive.** This offspring you assign to Allah and reserve for yourselves the sons, whom you regard as a source of joy and pride. Even then you claim that you believe in Allah.

## Ayat 17

- `(They believe so although when) any of them is given tidings of the birth of a female child the like of which he assigns to the Merciful One, his countenance darkens and he is choked with grief.`

## Ayat 18

- `Do they assign to Allah one who grows up amidst ornaments and is not well-versed in the art of disputation?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quaan:
  - In other words, You have assigned to Allah the offspring that is by nature delicate, weak and frail, and adopted for yourselves the offspring that is bold, courageous and fearless.
  - This verse shows permissibility of the ornaments for the women, for Allah has mentioned the ornaments as a natural thing for them. The same is also confirmed by the Hadith. Imam Ahmad, Abu Daud and Nasai have related on the authority of Ali that **the Prophet (peace be upon him) took silk in one hand and gold in the other and said that both were forbidden to be used in dress by the men of his Ummah**. Tirmidhi and Nasai have related from Abu Musa Ashari a tradition, saying that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: **Silk and gold have been forbidden for the men but made lawful for the women of my Ummah.** Allama Abu Bakr al-Jassas has discussed this question in his Ahkam ai-Quran and related the following traditions:

## Ayat 19

- `They claim that angels, who are Allah's chosen servants, are females.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, who are free from this that they should be males or females.
- `Did they witness how their body is constituted?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Another translation can be: Were they present at the time of their creation?
- `Their testimony shall be written and they shall be called to account.`

## Ayat 20

- `They say:`
  - `“Had the Merciful One so willed, we would never have worshipped these deities.”`
 - `But they have no knowledge of the matter and are simply conjecturing.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This was their reasoning from destiny to cover up their deviation and error, and this has been the argument of the wrongdoers in every age. They argued that their worshiping the angels became possible only because Allah allowed them to do so. Had He not willed so they could not have done it; and then it had been a practice with them for centuries and no torment from Allah had descended on them, which meant that Allah did not disapprove of their this practice.

## Ayat 21

- `Or did We bestow upon them a Book before on whose authority they are holding on (to angel-worship)?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It means this: These ignorant people think that whatever is happening in the world has the approval of Allah for it, because it is happening according to His will.
    - This argument, however, is wrong.
  - For it is not only shirk which is being committed in the world, but countless other crimes like stealing, robbery, murder, bribery, etc. are also taking place, which nobody likes. Then, can it be said by the same reasoning that all such acts are lawful and good only because Allah is letting them happen in His world, and when He allows them to happen, He must have approved of them also? The means of knowing what Allah likes and what He hates are not the events that are happening in the world, but the Book of Allah, which comes through His Messenger and in which Allah Himself states as to what beliefs, what deeds and what morals He likes and what He dislikes.
  - If these people have a Book, which came before the Quran, and which tells that Allah has appointed the angels also as deities beside himself and that they should worship them also, they should cite it. 
    - (For further explanation, see (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayats 107-112, 137, 148-149); (Surah Al- Aaraf, Ayat 28);(Surah Younus, Ayat 99); (Surah Hud, Ayats 118-119);(Surah Ar-Raad, Ayat 31); (Surah An-Nahl, Ayats 9, 35-36, 93); and(E.N. 20 of Surah Az-Zumar) and(E.N. 11 of Surah Ash-Shura).)

## Ayat 22

- `Nay; they simply claim:`
  - `“We found our forefathers on a way, and we continue to find guidance in their footsteps.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, they have no authority of any divine book. The only authority they have is that it has been the practice since the time of their forefathers. Therefore, they have taken the angels as goddesses in imitation of them.

## Ayat 23

- `And thus it is: whenever We sent any warner to a city its affluent ones said:`
  - `“We found our forefathers on a way and we continue to follow in their footsteps.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here, the point worth consideration is why only the well to do people of every community have resisted the Prophets and upheld the imitation of their forefathers in every age. Why have they alone been in the forefront to oppose the truth and to endeavor to maintain the established falsehood and to beguile and incite the common people against them? Its basic causes were two:

## Ayat 24

- `Each Prophet asked them:`
  - `“Will you do so even if we were to show you a way better than the way of your forefathers?”`
- `They answered:`
  - `“We disbelieve in the religion with which you have been sent.”`

## Ayat 25

- `Then We exacted retribution from them. So do consider the end of those who gave the lie (to the Prophets).`
