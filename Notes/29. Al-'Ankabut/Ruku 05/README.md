**Ayat 45 - 51**

## Ayat 45

- `(O Prophet),`
- **`recite the Book that has been revealed to you and establish Prayer.`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The address apparently is directed to the Prophet (peace be upon him) but, in fact, it is meant for all the believers.
    - Until now they were being counseled patience and reliance on Allah to brave the extreme trying conditions in which they found themselves, and the persecutions they were being subjected to on account of their faith. Now they are being told to recite the Quran and establish the Salat as a practical device, for these are the two things which endow a believer with a strong character and a wonderful capacity by which he can not only brave successfully the most violent storms of evil and falsehood but can even subdue them. But man can acquire this power from the recitation of the Quran and the prayer only when he does not remain content with the mere recital of the words but also understands well the Quranic teachings and absorbs them in his soul. And his prayer does not remain confined to physical movements but becomes the very function of his heart and the motive force for his morals and character.
    - The desired quality of the prayer is being mentioned by the Quran itself in the next sentence. As for its recitation, one should know that the recitation which does not reach the heart beyond the throat, cannot even give man enough power to remain steadfast to his faith, not to speak of enabling him to withstand the furies of unbelief. About such people, a Hadith says: **“They will recite the Quran, but the Quran will not go beyond their throats; they will leave the faith just as the arrow leaves the bow.”** (Bukhari, Muslim, Muatta).
    - As a matter of fact, the recitation which does not effect any change in a man’s way of thinking, and his morals and character, and he goes on doing what the Quran forbids, is not the recitation of a believer at all. About such a one the Prophet (peace be upon him) has said: **“He who makes lawful what the Quran has declared unlawful, has not believed in the Quran at all.”** (Tirmidhi).
    - Such a recitation does not reform and strengthen a man’s self and spirit, but makes him even more stubborn against Allah and impudent before his own conscience, and destroys his character altogether. For the case of the person who believes in the Quran as a divine Book, reads it and comes to know what his God has enjoined, and then goes on violating His injunctions, is of the culprit, who commits a crime not due to ignorance but after full knowledge of the law. The Prophet (peace be upon him) has elucidated this point in a brief sentence, thus: **“The Quran is a testimony in your favor as well as against you,”** (Muslim). That is, “If you follow the Quran rightly, it is a testimony in your favor. Whenever you are called to account for your deeds, here or in the Hereafter, you can produce the Quran as a testimony in your defense, saying that whatever you did was in accordance with this Book. If what you did was precisely according to it, no jurist in the world will be able to punish you, nor will God in the Hereafter hold you accountable for it. But if this Book has reached you, and you have read it and found out what your Lord demands from you, what He enjoins and what He forbids, and then you adopt an attitude opposed to it, then this Book will be a testimony against you. It will further strengthen the criminal case against you in the court of God. Then it will in no way be possible for you to escape the punishment, or receive a light punishment, by making the excuse of ignorance.
- **`Surely Prayer forbids indecency and evil.`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is an important characteristic out of the many characteristics of the prayer, which has been presented here prominently in view of its relevance to the context. To counter the severe storm of opposition and resistance that the Muslims were experiencing in Makkah, they stood in need of a moral force rather than any material power. To bring about the moral force and develop it suitably two practical devices were pointed out in the first instance, the recitation of the Quran and the establishment of the Salat. Now they are being told that the establishment of the Salat is the means through which they can get rid of those evils in which they themselves had been involved before they embraced Islam and in which the non-Muslim Arabs and the non Arab world around them were involved at that time.
- **`And Allah's remembrance is of even greater merit.`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - With a little thinking one can easily understand why this special advantage of the prayer has been particularly mentioned here. Evidently, getting rid of the moral evils is not only useful insofar as it is beneficial for those who attain the moral purity, both here and in the Hereafter, but its inevitable advantage is that it gives them unique superiority over those who might be involved in diverse moral evils, and who might be exerting their utmost to sustain the impure system of ignorance, which nourishes those evils, against the efforts of the morally pure people.
    - Indecent and evil acts are those which man by nature abhors, and which have always been held as evil in principle by the people of every community and society, however depraved and perverted practically.
    - The Arab society in the days of the revelation of the Quran was no exception to this. Those people also were aware of the moral virtues and the evils: they valued the good above the evil and there might be none among them, who regarded the evil as identical with the good, or depreciated goodness. Under such conditions, in a perverted society like that, the emergence of a movement which revolutionized morally members of the same society itself as soon as they came into contact with it, and raised them in character high above their contemporaries, inevitably had widespread effects. The common Arabs could not possibly fail to feel the moral impact of the movement, which eradicated evils and promoted goodness. And could not go on following those who were morally corrupt and were fighting to sustain a system of ignorance which had been nourishing those evils since centuries. That is why the Quran at that time exhorted the Muslims to establish Salat instead of urging them to collect material resources and force and strength that could win over the people’s hearts and defeat the enemy without any material force.
- **`Allah knows all that you do.`**

## Ayat 46

- `Argue not with the People of the Book`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It should be noted that a little below in this Surah the people are being exhorted to migrate. At that time Habash was the only place of safety to which the Muslims could migrate, and Habash in those days was under the domination of the Christians. Therefore, in these verses the Muslims are being instructed as to how they should argue and discuss matters concerning religion with the people of the Book when such an occasion arises.
- `except in the fairest manner,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the discussion should be conducted rationally, in a civilized and decent language, so that the ideas of the other person may be reformed. The preacher’s main aim should be to appeal to the addressee’s heart, convey the truth to him and bring him to the right path. He should not fight like a wrestler whose only object is to defeat his opponent. He should rather conduct himself like a physician who is ever cautious not to cause the patient’s ailment to worsen by any of his own mistakes, and tries to cure him with the least possible trouble. This instruction bas been given here especially in connection with the conduct of a discussion with the people of the Book, but is a general instruction pertaining to the preaching of the religion and it has been given at several places in the Quran. For example, **“O Prophet, invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and excellent admonition and discuss things with the people in the best manner.”** (Surah AnNahl: Ayat 125). **“O Prophet, goodness and evil are not alike, repel evil with what is best. You will see that he, with whom you had enmity, has become your closest friend.”** (Surah Ha Mim As-Sajdah: Ayat 34). **“O Prophet, repel evil with what is best: We are fully aware of what they utter against you.”** (Surah Al-Muminun: Ayat 96). **“O Prophet, adopt the way of leniency and forbearance; enjoin what is good and avoid useless discussions with the ignorant people. If Satan ever excites you to anger, seek refuge in Allah.”** (Surah Al-Aaraf: Ayat 199-200).
- `unless it be those of them that are utterly unjust.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, with those who adopt an attitude of wickedness a different attitude may also be adopted according to the nature and extent of their wickedness. In other words, one cannot, and should not adopt a soft and gentle attitude towards all sorts of the people under all circumstances at all time, which might be mistaken for the weakness and meekness of the inviter to the truth. Islam does teach its followers to be polite, gentle and reasonable, but it does not teach them to be unduly humble and meek so that they are not taken for granted by every cruel and wicked person.
- `Say to them:`
  - `“We believe in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to you. One is our God and your God; and we are those who submit ourselves to Him.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
        - In these sentences Allah has provided guidance to the best method of discussion, which the inviters to the truth should adopt. The method is this: “Do not make the error or deviation of the other person the basis and starting point of the discussion, but begin the discussion with those points of truth and justice which are common between you and your opponent. That is, the discussion should start from the points of agreement and not from the points of difference. Then, arguing from the agreed points, the addressee should be made to understand that, in the matter of the things in which you differ, your stand is in conformity with the agreed points whereas his stand is contradictory to them.


## Ayat 47

- `(O Prophet), thus have We bestowed the Book on you.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This can have two meanings:
      - (1) Just as We had sent down the Books to the former Prophets, so We have sent down this Book to you; and
      - (2) We have sent down this Book with the teaching that it should be believed in not by rejecting Our former Books but by affirming faith in all of them.
- `So those on whom We had bestowed the Book before believe in it,`
- `and of these (Arabs) too a good many believe in it.`
- `It is none but the utter unbelievers who deny Our Signs.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The context itself shows that this does not imply all the people of the Book but only those who were blessed with the right understanding and the knowledge of the divine scriptures, and were the people of the Book in the true sense. When this last Book of Allah came before them, confirming His earlier Books, they did not show any stubbornness or obstinacy but accepted it sincerely as they had accepted the previous Books.

## Ayat 48

- `(O Prophet), you did not recite any Book before, nor did you write it down with your hand; for then the votaries of falsehood would have had a cause for doubt.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the same argument that has already been given in Surahs Yunus and Al-Qasas as a proof of the Prophet’s Prophethood. See(E.N. 21 of Surah Yunus) and(E.N.'s 64 and 109 of Surah Al-Qasas). For further explanation, see (E.N. 107 of Surah An-Nahl), (E.N. 105 of Surah Bani Israil),(E.N. 66 of Surah Al-Muminun), (E.N. 12 of Surah Al- Furqan), and(E.N. 84 of Surah Ash-Shuara).

## Ayat 49

- `But it is a set of Clear Signs in the hearts of those who have been endowed with knowledge.`
- `None except the utterly unjust will deny Our Signs.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the presentation of a Book like the Quran by an unlettered person, and the manifestation by him, all of a sudden, of extraordinary qualities of character while nobody ever noticed him making any preparation for these previously, are in fact the clearest signs which serve as pointers to his prophethood for those who are possessed of knowledge and wisdom.”
  - If one reviews the life-story of any great historical personage, one can always discover the factors in his environment, which molded his personality and prepared him for the excellences and qualities that emanated from him in life. There always exists a clear relationship between his environment and the component aspects of his personality. But no source whatever can be discovered in his environment of the wonderful qualities and excellences that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) displayed.
  - In his case, neither in the contemporary Arab society nor in the society of the neighboring countries with which Arabia had any relations can one discover those factors which could have any remote relationship with the component aspects of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) personality. This is the reality on the basis of which it has been asserted here that the Prophet Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) personality is not one sign but a collection of many clear signs. An ignorant person may not see any of these signs but those who are possessed of knowledge have become convinced in their hearts by seeing these signs that he is most certainly a true Prophet of Allah.

## Ayat 50

- `They say:`
  - `“Why were Signs from his Lord not sent down upon him?”`
- `Say:`
  - `“The Signs are only with Allah. As for me, I am no more than a plain warner.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, miracles by seeing which one may be convinced that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is really a Prophet of Allah.

## Ayat 51

- `Does it not suffice for them (as a Sign) that We revealed to you the Book that is recited to them?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “A Book like the Quran has been sent down to you in spite of your being unlettered. Is it not by itself a great miracle which should convince the people of your Prophethood? Do they yet need another miracle after this? The other miracles were the miracles for those who witnessed them. But this miracle is ever present in front of them. It is being recited before them almost daily; they can witness it as and when they like.” Even after such an assertion and argument by the Quran the audacity of those who try to prove that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was literate is astonishing. The fact, however, is that the Quran here has presented in clear terms the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) being illiterate as a strong proof of his prophethood. The traditions which lend support to the claim that the Prophet (peace be upon him) could read and write, or had learned reading and writing later in life, stand rejected at first glance, for no tradition opposed to the Quran can be acceptable. Then these traditions in themselves are too weak to become the basis for an argument.
    - **One of these is a tradition from Bukhari that when the peace treaty of Hudaibiya was being written down, the representative of the disbelievers of Makkah objected to the word Rasul-Allah being added to the name of the Prophet (peace be upon him). At this the Prophet ordered the writer (Ali, may Allah be pleased with him) to cross out the word Rasul-Allah and write Muhammad bin Abdullah instead. Ali refused to cross out Rasul-Allah. Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) took it in his own hand, struck out the word himself and wrote Muhammad bin Abdullah.**
- `Surely there is mercy and good counsel in it for those who believe.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - But this tradition from Bara bin Azib appears at four places in Bukhari and at two places in Muslim and everywhere in different words:
