**Ayat 52 - 63**

## Ayat 52

- `Say (O Prophet):`
  - `“Allah suffices as a witness between me and you.`
  - `He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth.`
  - **`As for those who believe in falsehood and are engaged in infidelity with Allah, it is they who will be the losers.”`**

## Ayat 53

- `They ask you to hasten in bringing chastisement upon them.`
- `Had there not been an appointed term for it, the chastisement would have already visited them;`
- `in fact it will come down upon them all of a sudden (at its appointed time) while they will not be aware of it.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “They are challenging you again and again that If you are a true messenger and they are really denying the truth, then you should not delay the torment with which you threaten them.”


## Ayat 54

- `They ask you to hasten the chastisement upon them although Hell encompasses the unbelievers.`

## Ayat 55

- `(They will become aware of it) the Day when the chastisement will overwhelm them from above and from under their feet, and He will say to them:`
  - `“Taste now the consequence of the deeds that you used to commit.”`

## Ayat 56

- `O My servants who believe, verily My earth is vast; so serve Me alone.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is an allusion to the Hijrah, which implies this: if you feel that it is becoming difficult to worship God in Makkah, you may leave it and move to another place where you can live as the true servants of God, for God’s earth is vast. You should serve Allah and not your nation and country. This shows that the real thing is not the nation and the home and the country but the worship of Allah. If at any time the demands of the nation and country’s love clash with the demands of Allah’s worship, it is the time of trial for the believer’s faith. The true believer will worship Allah and spurn the nation and the country and home. The false claimant to the faith will abandon the faith and remain clinging to his nation and his country and home.
  - This verse is clearly indicative of the fact that a true worshiper of God can be a patriot but he cannot be a worshiper of the nation and the country. For him the worship of God is the dearest thing in life for the sake of which he will sacrifice everything else, but with never be prepared to sacrifice it for anything else.

## Ayat 57

- `Every being shall taste death, then it is to Us that you shall be sent back.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “Do not be anxious for your life: one has to die sooner or later. No one has come to live forever in this world. Therefore, your real problem is not how to save life, but your real problem is how to save your faith, and fulfill the requirements of God worship. You have ultimately to return to Us. If you lost your faith for the sake of saving your life, the result in the Hereafter will be different. But if you lost your life for the sake of saving your faith, the result will be just the opposite. **Therefore, you should be anxious only about what you will bring when you return to Us.** Will you come with a faith sacrificed for the sake of life, or a life sacrificed for the sake of the faith?”

## Ayat 58

- `We shall house those who believed and acted righteously in the lofty mansions of Paradise beneath which rivers flow.`
- `There they shall remain for ever.`
- `How excellent a reward it is for those who acted (in obedience to Allah),`

## Ayat 59

- `who remained steadfast`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Who are patient: who remained steadfast in faith in the face of hardships and afflictions and losses and persecutions; who have endured the consequences of the faith and have not turned away; who have seen the advantages and benefits of abandoning the faith and have not been lured away by them; who have seen the disbelievers and the wrongdoers prosper in the world and have not cast even a stray glance at their wealth and splendor.”
- `and put their trust in their Lord!`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “In their Lord put their trust: who did not put their trust in their possessions and their business and their clans and tribes but in their Lord; who were prepared to fight every power and endure every danger for the sake of their faith only on the basis of their trust in their Lord irrespective of the worldly means, and left their homes if their faith so demanded; who trusted their Lord that He would not let go waste the rewards of their faith and good works, and were sure that He would succor His believers and righteous servants even in this world and bless them with the best rewards in the Hereafter as well.”


## Ayat 60

- `How many an animal there is that does not carry about its sustenance.`
- `Allah provides sustenance to them and to you.`
- `He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “While migrating you should not be worried about your means of livelihood as you should not worry about your life’s safety. For none of the birds and the animals of the land and the sea that you find around yourself carries its provision with it. Allah is providing for all of them; wherever they go they get their provision through Allah’s bounty. Therefore, do not be disheartened by the thought that if you left your homes for the sake of your faith, you would have nothing to eat. Allah will provide for you as well from the sources from which He is providing for the countless of His other creatures.”

## Ayat 61

- `If you were to ask them:`
  - `“Who created the heavens and the earth and Who has kept the sun and the moon in subjection?”`
- `they will certainly say:`
  - `“Allah.”`
- `How come, then, they are being deluded from the Truth?`

## Ayat 62

- `Allah enlarges the sustenance of any of His servants whom He will,`
- `and straitens the sustenance of whom He will.`
- `Surely Allah has knowledge of everything.`

Very profound Ayah for myself.

## Ayat 63

- `If you were to ask them:`
  - `“Who sent down water from the sky and therewith revived the earth after its death?”`
- `they will certainly say:`
  - `“Allah.”`
- `Say:`
  - `“To Allah alone be praise and thanks.”`
- `But most people do not understand.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here the word al-hamdu-lillah (Praise be to Allah) gives two meanings:
    - (1) “When all this is done by Allah, then He alone is worthy of all praise, and none else”, and
    - (2) “Thank God that you yourselves also admit this.”
