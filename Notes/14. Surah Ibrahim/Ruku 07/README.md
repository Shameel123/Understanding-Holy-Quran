**Ayat 42 - 52**


## Ayat 42

- `Do not think Allah is heedless of the evil deeds in which the evil-doers are engaged.`
- `He is merely granting them respite until a Day when their eyes shall continue to stare in horror,`

## Ayat 43

- `when they shall keep pressing ahead in haste,`
- `their heads lifted up,`
- `their gaze directed forward,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This graphic picture depicts the horrible plight of the wrongdoers on the Day of Reckoning. When they will realize the situation, they will be so taken aback that they will have their looks fixed straight in front of them without seeing anything.
- `unable to look away from what they behold,`
- `their hearts utterly void.`

## Ayat 44

- `(O Muhammad),`
- `warn mankind of the Day when a severe chastisement shall overtake them,`
- `and the wrong-doers will say:`
  - `"Our Lord, grant us respite for a short while; we shall respond to Your call and will follow Your Messengers."`
- `(But they will be clearly told):`
  - `"Are you not the same who swore earlier that they shall never suffer decline?"`

## Ayat 45

- `You said so even though you had lived in the dwellings of those who had wronged themselves (by sinning),`
- `and you were aware how We dealt with them,`
- `and We had even explained to you all this by giving examples.`

## Ayat 46

- `Indeed the unbelievers contrived their plan,`
- `but it is in Allah's power to nullify their plan,`
- `even though their plans were such that would move even mountains.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, you have seen that the former people who violated the divine law, and who opposed the message, devised very effective and cunning schemes to avert the consequences of their iniquity, but Allah defeated them with His single counter device.
  - You did not give up your crafty schemes against the message of truth in the vain hope that your strong measures would succeed where the schemes of your predecessors had failed.

## Ayat 47

- `So, do not think, (O Prophet), that Allah will go back upon His promise to His Messengers.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Though this has been addressed to the Prophet (peace be upon him), it is really meant for his opponents.
    - They are being warned that they should not delude themselves because of the delay in their punishment.
    - They should note it well that Allah fulfilled the promises He made to the former Messengers and defeated their opponents. 
    - Likewise He will surely fulfill the promises He had made to Muhammad (peace be upon him).
- `Surely Allah is Mighty, Lord of retribution.`

## Ayat 48

- `(Do warn them of the) Day when the heavens and the earth shall be altogether changed;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It is obvious from this verse and some hints in the Quran that on the occasion of Resurrection, the Earth and the Heavens will not be totally destroyed
    - but at the blowing of the First Trumpet, the existing physical system shall be disarranged.
    - After this, between the blowing of the First and the Last Trumpet (Allah alone knows how long this interval will last), the present form and aspect of the earth and the heavens shall be transformed and a new physical system with new physical laws will come into existence.
    - That will be the world of the Hereafter.
    - When the Last Trumpet will be blown, all human beings from Adam to those born before the First Trumpet, shall be brought to life and appear before Allah.
    - **The Quran calls this Hashr which literally means “to muster and gather together”.**
    - It appears from the wording of the Quran and some clear statements in the traditions that this will take place on this Earth.
    - The Seat of Judgment and the Scales will be established on the Earth and the decisions will be passed here.
    - This is also clear from the Quran and the traditions that the life in the Hereafter will not merely be a spiritual life but the very physical and spiritual life which we are living now on this earth;
    - and every individual shall receive his reward or punishment exactly in that personality in which he or she is living in the life of this world.
- `when all will appear fully exposed before Allah,`
- **`the One, the Irresistible!`**

## Ayat 49

- `On that Day you shall see the guilty ones secured in chains;`

## Ayat 50

- `their garments shall be black as if made out of pitch,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Some commentators and translators are of the opinion that Qatiran stands for sulphur or molten copper but actually it stands for tar and the like.
- `and flames of the Fire shall cover their faces`

## Ayat 51

- `so that Allah may requite each person for his deeds.`
- `Allah is swift in reckoning.`

## Ayat 52

- `This is a proclamation for all mankind that they may be warned by it, and that they may know that their God is none but the One True God, and that men of understanding may take heed.`
