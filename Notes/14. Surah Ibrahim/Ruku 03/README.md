**Ayat 13 - 21**

## Ayat 13

- `Then the unbelievers told their Messengers:`
  - `"You will have to return to the fold of our faith or else we shall banish you from our land."`
- `Thereupon their Lord revealed to them:`
  - `"We will most certainly destroy these wrong-doers,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It will be wrong to conclude from this demand of theirs that the Prophets professed the religion of their people before their appointment to the divine office.
  - This only meant that their people thought so because before their appointment they led a quiet life and did not propagate a new religion nor refuted the religion in vogue at that time.
  - That is why their people were under the wrong impression that the Prophets also professed the religion of their forefathers, and, therefore, accused them of apostasy.
  - The fact, however, is that they had never followed the religion of their mushrik forefathers and were not guilty of apostasy.

## Ayat 14

- `and will then cause you to settle in the land as their successors.`
- `That is the reward for him who fears to stand for reckoning and holds My threat in awe."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This was to reassure the Prophets that they should not worry at all about the threat that the disbelievers would banish them from their country, as if to say: We will uproot them from their land, and establish you and your followers firmly in their place.

## Ayat 15

- `They sought Our judgement.`
- `And (thanks to that judgement) every obstinate tyrant opposed to the Truth was brought to naught.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In order to grasp the real significance of these historical events, it should be kept in view that these are being related here as answers to those objections which the disbelievers of Makkah raised before the Prophet (peace be upon him).
  - As the conditions there at the time of the revelation of this Surah were exactly like those of the peoples of the former Prophets, they have been cited here to warn the Quraish along with the other mushriks of Arabia of the consequences, as if to say:
    - The former disbelievers challenged their Messengers and were destroyed and the believers were established in the land. Likewise your future also entirely depends on the attitude you adopt towards the message of your Prophet. If you accept this, you will be allowed to remain in the land of Arabia, and if you reject it you shall be utterly uprooted from here.
  - The subsequent events proved that this prophecy was literally fulfilled within fifteen years after this, for there remained not a single mushrik in the whole of Arabia.

## Ayat 16

- `Hell is before him and he shall be made to drink of the oozing pus,`

## Ayat 17

- `which he will gulp but will scarcely swallow, and death will come upon him from every quarter, and yet he will not be able to die.`
- `A terrible chastisement lies ahead in pursuit of him.`

## Ayat 18

- `This is the example of those who disbelieve in their Lord: their works are like ashes upon which the wind blows fiercely on a tempestuous day.`
- `They shall find no reward for their deeds.1`
- `That indeed is the farthest point in straying.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, those who were perfidious, faithless, and disobedient to the divine message, and refused to adopt that way to which the Messengers invited, will find in the end that all the deeds and earnings of their lives were as worthless as a heap of ashes.
  - Just as each and every particle of a high mound of ashes formed during a long course of years is scattered by the wind on a stormy day, likewise all their grand works will prove on the stormy doomsday to be no more than a mound of ashes. Their dazzling culture, their grand civilization, their wonderful kingdoms and states, their magnificent universities, their sciences and their literatures, nay, even their hypocritical worship, and so called virtuous deeds, their charitable and reformative works of which they were very proud in the worldly life, shall prove to be as worthless as a heap of ashes, and will be scattered by the storm of the Day of Resurrection.
  - So much so that there shall not remain a single particle of their works worthy of being placed in the divine scale on that Day in their favor.

## Ayat 19

- `Do you not see that Allah created the heavens and the earth in Truth?1`
- `Were He to will, He could take you away and bring a new creation.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the proof of the preceding statement that the works of the disbelievers are worthless like ashes. The question implies: Why are you skeptical of this? Do you not see that the grand system of the earth and the heavens is based on the survival of truth and not on the survival of falsehood. Everything bears witness to the fact that anything which is not based on truth and reality but rests on unreal speculation and guess work cannot continue to live long. Therefore anyone who builds his works on the latter will most surely fail in his designs. For it is obvious that such a person builds his works on sand and should not, therefore, expect that they can last long. Likewise those who discard the truth and reality and build their works on false theories and presumptions should not expect at all that they can have any lasting value for they are bound to be scattered like worthless ashes. If this is obvious as it is, why should you cherish any doubts about the fact that anyone who builds the system of his life on the basis that he is independent of Allah or on the godhead of someone else (whereas there is no other God) shall inevitably find all his works to be worthless. When the fact is that man is not absolutely independent in this world nor is he the servant of anyone else than Allah, why should you not expect that anyone who builds his works on this falsehood, shall find that all his works were worthless like the heap of ashes that was scattered all over by the wind?

## Ayat 20

- `That is not at all difficult for Allah.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is by way of admonition that follows immediately the proof of the statement in the preceding verse. This removes also any doubt that might arise concerning that decisive statement.
  - One might question it like this: If the creation is really based on the survival of truth, why is it that every follower of falsehood and every wrongdoer is not destroyed forthwith?
  - This is the answer: O foolish man, do you think that it is difficult for Allah to destroy such a person? Or, do you think that Allah does not destroy him because he has some close relationship with Him? If this is not so, and you yourself know that it is not so, you should understand it well that any community that follows falsehood and commits wicked deeds is always in danger of being removed to make room for a better community to work in its stead. If respite is given and the threat does not take a practical shape, it does not mean that there is no danger at all. Instead of being neglectful, you should make use of every moment of this respite and realize that the false system which you are following is not stable and durable. You should, therefore, build it on stable and durable foundations.

## Ayat 21

- `Then all of them will appear exposed before Allah,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word baruz means to emerge and also implies to become known. 
    - That is why it has been translated into “shall appear before Allah”, for it implies both these meanings.
    - As a matter of fact, all the people are fully exposed all the time before Allah but they do not realize it.
    - They will, however, realize it on the Day of Judgment when they shall be presented before the Greatest of all Judges that they were fully exposed before Him all along. So much so that every deed they did and each and everything they thought and desired is known to Him.
- `and the weak ones will say to the haughty ones:`
  - `"We merely followed you. Will you, then, protect us from Allah's chastisement?"`
- `They will say:`
  - `"Had Allah shown us the Way to our salvation, we would surely have also guided you. Now it is all the same whether we cry or suffer patiently, we have no escape."`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is to serve as a warning to all those people who follow others blindly or obey and submit to tyrants because they say: We are weak. They are warned, as if to say: You should note it well that those leaders, saints, officers and rulers whom you arc following blindly today, will not be able to protect you at all from the chastisement of Allah. Therefore, you should consider it well today where such people, whom you are following or obeying, are themselves going and where they are leading you.
