**Ayat 07 - 12**

## Ayat 07

- `Also call to mind when your Lord proclaimed:`
  - `"If you give thanks, I will certainly grant you more;`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, if you are grateful, you will appreciate Our favors and make right use of them, and will not rebel against Our commandments, but will surrender and submit to Us to show your gratitude to Us.
  - `but if you are ungrateful for My favours, My chastisement is terrible.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Deuteronomy (Bible) contains a long and detailed discourse to this effect.
      - According to it, Prophet Moses (peace be upon him), on the eve of his death, reminded the Israelites of all important events from their history, and reiterated all the divine commandments of the Torah which Allah had sent to them through him. Then he told them in a long speech that if they obeyed their Lord, they would be given great rewards. But if they adopted the attitude of disobedience, they would get a terrible punishment.
      - This discourse spreads over chapters 4, 6, 8, 10, 11 and 28, 30.
      - Some of these passages are so impressive and instructive that it will be worthwhile to quote a few of them: Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. (Deut. 6: 47).

## Ayat 08

 - `Moses said:`
   - `"Were you to disbelieve`
   - `- you and all those who live on earth -`
   - `Allah is still Self-Sufficient, Innately Praiseworthy."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It should be noted that a reference to Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) and his people has been made here to warn the people of Makkah of the consequences of their ingratitude towards this favor of Allah that He has raised Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) from among them.
  - This was a timely warning, for at that time they were showing ingratitude by rejecting that message. They were, therefore, warned to learn a lesson from the miserable condition of the Israelites, which was the result of their ingratitude to and rebellion against Allah’s favors.


## Ayat 09

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The speech of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) ended with( Ayat 8). From here begins a direct address to the disbelievers of Makkah.

- `Have the accounts of your predecessors not reached you:`
  - `the people of Noah, the Ad, the Thamud, and those who came after them - they whose number is not known to any except Allah?`
- `Their Messengers came to them with Clear Signs, but they thrust their hands in their mouths, and said:`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - There has been a great deal of difference of opinion in regard to the meaning of the Arabic words of the text and different commentators have assigned different meanings to them. But we arc of the opinion that these express merely the intolerance and perplexity and a bit of anger that was being shown by the disbelievers towards the message and this is confirmed by the subsequent sentence.
  - `"We do surely reject the Message you have brought, and we are in disquieting doubt about what you are summoning us to."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - They had a “grave doubt” about the message because it had taken away their peace of mind.
      - This was because invitation to the message always makes the minds uneasy, for it becomes hard even for its opponents to reject it outright or oppose it with peace of mind.
      - Howsoever they might give vent to their doubts about it and oppose it tooth and nail the force of its truth and its sound arguments, its frankness and candor and its winning manners of exposition produce a great agitation in the minds of its bitterest opponents.
      - Then the pure and spotless character of the Messenger and the marked change for the better brought about in his followers produce such an accumulative effect on their minds that even their most bitter antagonists begin to feel uneasy about their own stand.
      - Thus, those who try to disturb the peace of mind of the upholders of the truth are themselves deprived of their own peace of mind.

## Ayat 10

- `Their Messengers said:`
  - `"Can there be any doubt about Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The Messengers posed this question to those who rejected the message in order to bring home to them the absurdity of their stand with regard to God.
      - For though, the mushriks of every age believed in the existence of God and acknowledged that He was the Creator of the heavens and the earth, they did not accept the message, its logical result, that He alone was entitled to their worship.
      - That is why the Messengers asked them: Do you have any doubt about the existence of Allah?
  - `He invites you that He may forgive you your sins and grant you respite till an appointed term."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - In the case of individuals, the appointed term may be either the time of one’s death or the doomsday.
      - As regards the appointed term for the rise and fall of communities, it is determined by their collective behavior. For instance, if a capable community degenerates before the expiry of its term, the assigned period is shortened and it is deposed. On the other hand, if a degenerate community changes its ways for the better, its term is extended, so much so that it may extend even to the doomsday.
      - This same thing is implied in (Ayat 11 of Surah Ar-Raad): The fact is that Allah does not change a people’s lot unless they themselves change their own characteristics.
- `They replied:`
  - `"You are only a human being like ourselves.`
  - `You seek to prevent us from serving those whom our forefathers have been serving all along.`
  - `If that is so, produce a clear authority for it."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The disbelievers meant to imply: You are a human being like us in every respect: you eat, drink and sleep like us and have wife and children like us. You feel hungry and thirsty, and suffer from heat and cold, disease and calamities like us. In short, you have every human limitation like us, and we see nothing unusual and extraordinary in you to induct us to accept you as a Prophet and believe that God communicates with you and sends His angels to you.

## Ayat 11

- `Their Messengers told them:`
  - `"Indeed we are only human beings like yourselves, but Allah bestows His favour on those of His servants whom He wills.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, if you still insist that you are a Prophet, bring a tangible proof of your appointment so as to convince us that you have really been sent by God and your message is from Him.
  - `It does not lie in our power to produce any authority except by the leave of Allah.`
  - `It is in Allah that the believers should put their trust.`

## Ayat 12

- `And why should we not put our trust in Allah when it is indeed He Who has guided us to the ways of our life?`
- `We shall surely continue to remain steadfast in face of your persecution.`
- `All those who have to put trust, should put their trust only in Allah."`
