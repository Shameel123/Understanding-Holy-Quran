**Ayat 01 - 06**

## Ayat 01


- `Alif. Lam. Ra'.`
- `This is a Book which We have revealed to you`
- `that you may bring forth mankind from every kind of darkness into light, and direct them,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the purpose for which the Prophet (peace be upon him) had been sent. He was entrusted with the mission that he should bring mankind back from the ways of darkness and ways of wickedness into the way of God by the help of the light of the Quran.
    - For everyone who is not on the way of God is, in fact, wandering about in the ways of the darkness and ignorance, even though he might consider himself to be very enlightened and full of knowledge. 
    - On the other hand, the one who finds the Way of Allah, comes into the light of knowledge, even though he might be an illiterate person.
- `with the leave of their Lord,`
  - `to the Way of the Mighty,`
  - `the Innately Praiseworthy,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - As regards to “by the permission of their Lord”, this implies that the most a missionary of Islam, even though he be a Messenger of Allah, can do is to present the right way.
      - It is not in his power to bring anyone forcibly to the way, for this can only happen by the help and permission of Allah.
      - That is why only that person whom Allah helps and permits gets guidance.
      - Otherwise, even a perfect missionary like a Messenger fails to bring a person to the right way.
      - As regards to the divine law, according to which Allah helps and permits a person to gain guidance, we learn from different passages of the Quran that Allah gives help only to that person who himself has a desire to get guidance: who frees himself from obduracy, obstinacy and prejudice: who is not a follower of his lust, nor a slave of his desires: who is inclined to see with open eyes and hear with open ears and think with a clear mind, and is ready to accede to any reasonable thing.

## Ayat 02

- `(to the Way of) Allah to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth.`
- `Woe be to those who reject the Truth for a severe chastisement,`

## Ayat 03

- `to those who have chosen the life of the world in preference to the Hereafter,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Those who reject the truth are the people whose interests are entirely bound with the life of this world, and who do not care at all for the interests of the life of the Hereafter: who are prepared to undergo any punishment in the next world for the sake of the interests, pleasures and comforts of this world: who, on the other hand, cannot bear the sacrifice of even the smallest pleasure in this world, nor are ready to bear any loss or encounter danger or trouble in this world for the sake of the joys of the next world.
    - In short, such are the people who have coolly considered and weighed the pleasures of this world against the joys of the next world, and decided in favor of this world: therefore, they readily sacrifice the interest of the next world whenever there is a clash between the two.
- `who hinder people from the Way of Allah,`
- `and seek to make it crooked.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, "They do not want to follow the Way of Allah, but endeavor that Allah's Way should follow their desires: it should adjust itself in such a way as to include all their conjectures, theories and whims as its part and parcel, and exclude every creed that does not suit their way of life: it should provide sanction for all their habits, customs and manners: it should not demand from them anything which they do not like: in short, the way of Allah should be their obedient slave and turn in the direction their devilish lusts want it to turn: nay, it should neither criticize them nor ask them to follow Allah’s injunctions. This is their condition for accepting the guidance of Allah.
- `They have gone far astray.`

## Ayat 04

- `Never have We sent a Messenger but he has addressed his people in their language that he may fully expound his Message to them.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This implies two things:
      - First, Allah sent down His message in the language of the people from among whom a Prophet was raised so that they might not have any excuse left that they could not understand the language of the message.
      - Secondly, this ruled out the presumption that a Messenger was ever given the message in a different language merely for the sake of a miracle. For Allah considered it more important to make the people understand the message and guide them rightly than to satisfy their curiosity. Obviously the purpose could best be served only if the message was sent down to them in their own language by their Prophet and not in any other.
- `(And after the Message is expounded), Allah lets go astray whomsoever He wills, and guides to the Right Way whomsoever He wills.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, although the Messenger conveys the message in the mother tongue of the people, which is understood by everyone of them, yet all of them are not guided aright. This happens because of the fact that all of those who understand a message do not necessarily accept it. For it is entirely with Allah to show guidance by means of His message to anyone He wills and to let go astray anyone in spite of it.
- `He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - As Allah is All-Powerful, no one is able by oneself to get guidance or to go astray, for none is completely independent but is under the power of Allah.
    - But as He is All-Wise, He does not use His power blindly so as to show guidance to anyone He wills and to let go astray anyone He desires without rhyme or reason. In fact, the one who gets guidance from Him gets it on merit and the one who is let go astray is deprived of guidance because he himself deliberately chooses deviation.

## Ayat 05

- `We indeed sent Moses with Our Signs, saying:`
  - `"Lead your people out of all kinds of darkness into light, and admonish them by narrating to them anecdotes from the Days of Allah."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The Arabic word ayyam technically means memorable historical events.
      - Therefore Ayyam-u-Allah (divine history) implies all those eventful chapters of human history which mention the rewards and punishments that were meted out to the great personalities and nations according to their deeds in the past ages.
  - `Verily in it there are great`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Those historical events are signs in this sense that their proper and intelligent study provides proofs of the fact that there is only one God: and that the law of retribution is universal and is based absolutely on the differentiation between the knowledge and moral practice of the truth and falsehood: that this law also requires another world (the Hereafter) for its due fulfillment.
      - Moreover, these events contain signs that serve as warnings against the evil consequences of building up systems of life on false creeds and theories, and help one to learn lessons from them.
  - `for everyone who is patient and gives thanks (to Allah).`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Though these signs are always there, only those persons learn lessons from them who remain steadfast in trials and appreciate the blessings of Allah rightly and are grateful to Him.
      - Obviously, frivolous and ungrateful persons cannot learn any lesson from these signs, even though they might grasp their significance.

## Ayat 06

- `And call to mind when Moses said to his people:`
  - `"Remember Allah's favour upon you when He delivered you from Pharaoh's people who afflicted you with a grievous chastisement, slaughtering your sons, while letting your women live.`
  - `In it there was a terrible trial from your Lord."`
