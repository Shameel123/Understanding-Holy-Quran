**Ayat 22 - 27**

## Ayat 22

- `After the matter has been finally decided Satan will say:`
  - `"Surely whatever Allah promised you was true; as for me, I went back on the promise I made to you.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - When the criminals will charge Satan with leading them astray, he will plead guilty, as if to say: You yourselves see now that all the promises and warnings made by Allah have come out true and all the promises which I made have proved to be false.
      - I also confess that it was all deception that I gave you false assurances of prosperity, beguiled you by greed and enticed you in the snare of great expectations. I assured you that in the first instance there will be no life in the Hereafter, and that, if there be any, you will be freed by the intercession of such and such a saint. The only thing you have to do is to make offerings before him: then you may do whatever you please, for he will deliver you from all the consequences.
      - I repeat that I said all these things and asked my agents to say the same.
  - `I had no power over you except that I called you to my way and you responded to me.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, you cannot say and prove that it was I who forced you to follow the wrong way, whereas you wanted to follow the right way. You will yourselves admit that it is not so. I did no more than this that I invited you to falsehood in opposition to the invitation to the truth and tempted you to vice instead of virtue. 
      - But I had no power to force you to the wrong way, if you desired to follow the right way, when you had the power and the option to follow either of the ways.
      - Now I am ready to bear the burden of the wicked invitation I extended to you, but you are not justified in any way to throw on me the burden of accepting my invitation for you did it on your own responsibility.
      - You should, therefore, yourselves bear all its consequences.
  - `So, do not blame me but blame yourselves.`
  - `Here, neither I can come to your rescue, nor can you come to mine.`
  - `I disavow your former act of associating me in the past with Allah.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This is a clear proof of shirk in practice, as apart from shirk in creed. As Satan will charge his followers with making him a partner with God, it is obvious that as far as creed is concerned there is no one who makes Satan a partner with God in His Godhead or His worship: nay, every one curses him for his evil ways. 
      - Nevertheless, people obey and submit to him and follow him blindly, as if he were their god and that is what has been termed shirk.
  - `A grievous chastisement inevitably lies ahead for such wrong-doers."`


## Ayat 23 

- `As for those who had believed and did good in the world, they shall be admitted to the Gardens beneath which rivers flow.`
- `There, with the leave of Allah, they shall abide forever, and will be greeted with: "Peace".`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Arabic word tahiyyah is literally a prayer for long life, but in usage it is a greeting at meeting. Therefore, the expression may mean: They will welcome one another with peace be upon you, or will be welcomed with these words. It may also be noted that the word salam implies both a prayer for peace and a congratulation on it.

## Ayat 24

- `Do you not see how Allah has given the example of a good word?1`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Though the expression literally means pure word, here it stands for truthful saying and righteous creed.
    - According to the Quran, this saying and creed are the acceptance of the doctrine of Tauhid, belief in Prophethood and revelation, and in the life of the Hereafter, for it declares these things to be the fundamental truths.
- `It is like a good tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and whose branches reach the sky,2`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is to show the strength and extent of the pure word. As the entire system of the universe hangs upon the reality contained in this pure word which the believer professes, the earth and its entire system cooperates with him and the heaven with its entire system welcomes him.
    - There is, therefore, no conflict between him and the law of nature, and everything in its very nature extends its help to him.

## Ayat 25

- `ever yielding its fruit in every season with the leave of its Lord.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the pure word is so fruitful that every person (or community) who bases his system of life on it, gets benefit from it every moment for it helps to produce clearness in thought, balance in temperament, strength in character, purity in morals, firmness in conduct, righteousness in talk, straightforwardness in conversation, good temperament in social behavior, nobility in culture, justice and equity in economy, honesty in politics, nobility in war, sincerity in peace; confidence in promises and pledges. In short, it is the elixir that changes everything into gold if one makes the proper use of it.
- `Allah gives examples for mankind that they may take heed.`

## Ayat 26

- `And the example of an evil word1 is that of an evil tree,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Evil word is the opposite of pure word.
    - It may be applied to everything that is unreal and wrong but here it stands for any false creed that one might adopt as a basis of his system of life, irrespective of whether it be atheism or heresy or disbelief or shirk or idol worship or any other ism that has not been brought by a Messenger.
- `uprooted from the surface of the earth, wholly unable to endure.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - And evil word (false creed) has no stability because it is against the law of nature. Therefore, everything in the universe opposes it and refutes it, as if the earth hates it and is ready to spit out its seeds every time they are sown in it, and if some seed succeeds in growing an evil tree, heaven suppresses down its branches.
    - In fact, false creed could never have been allowed to develop, if man had not been given the freedom of choice and respite for work for the sake of his trial.
    - That is why when same foolish people exert to establish a system of life on it, it is allowed to grow to a certain extent, but it produces nothing but harmful results as long as it lasts. And no sooner does it encounter with adverse circumstances than it is thoroughly uprooted from the earth.

## Ayat 27

- `Thus, through a firm word,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the believers remain steadfast during the life of this world because of their stable system of life based on this pure word.
    - For this gives than a straight point of view, a sound system of thought and a comprehensive theory of life, and it serves as a master key to the unraveling of all knots and the solving of all problems.
    - With its help, they acquire that strength of character and that firmness of conduct which keep them steady in the face of every vicissitude of life.
    - This provides them also with such solid principles of life which give them peace of mind and heart, and prevent them from deviation and caprice.
    - Above all, when, after the life of this world, they will enter into the life of the Hereafter, they will remain perfectly calm without any tinge of fear or anxiety, for they will find everything therein to be in accordance with their expectations, as if they were fully acquainted with every aspect of it before they entered into it.
    - For they had been fully informed of, and therefore fully prepared for every stage and phase of this life. That is why they will pass through every stage with perfect calmness and firmness in contrast to the disbelievers who built their worldly lives on an evil word and will, therefore, be taken aback to find everything against their expectations.
- `Allah grants firmness to the believers both in this world and in the Hereafter.`
- `As for the wrong-doers, Allah lets them go astray.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Allah lets the transgressors, who discard the pure word and follow an evil word, go astray by creating confusion in their minds and misdirecting their efforts because of this deviation. That is why they cannot find the right way of thought and action and so fail miserably.
- `Allah does whatever He wills.`
