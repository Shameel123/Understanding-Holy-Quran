**Ayat 11 - 20**

## Ayat 11

- `Were Allah to hasten to bring upon men (the consequence of) evil in the way men hasten in seeking the wealth of this world, their term would have long since expired.`
- **`(But that is not Our way.)`**
- `So We leave alone those who do not expect to meet Us that they may blindly stumble in their transgression.`

## Ayat 12

- `And (such is man that) when an affliction befalls him, he cries out to Us, reclining and sitting and standing.`
- `But no sooner than We have removed his affliction, he passes on as though he had never cried out to Us to remove his affliction.`
- `Thus it is that the misdeeds of the transgressors are made fair-seeming to them.`

## Ayat 13

- `Surely We destroyed the nations (which had risen to heights of glory in their times) before you`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Arabic word qarn is commonly used for the people living during the same period. But from the way the Quran has used this word on different occasions, it is evident that by qarn is, meant the community which had been invested with power and authority and appointed wholly or partially to the position of leadership of the world.
    - One way in which such a community is destroyed is that it is totally exterminated but there are other forms of its destruction also.
- `when they indulged in wrong-doing`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here the word zulm has not been used in its commonly known limited sense, but it covers all sorts of sins that are committed, when people transgress the boundaries of Allah’s slavery. Refer to (E.N. 49 of Surah Al-Baqarah).
- `and refused to believe even when their Messengers brought clear signs to them.`
- `Thus do We recompense the people who are guilty.`

## Ayat 14

- `Now We have appointed you as their successors in the earth to see how you act.`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - (Ayats 13-14) have been pointedly addressed to the Arabs so as to say,
    - “O Prophet (peace be upon him) of Arabia, learn a lesson from the communities that have passed before you. They were given an opportunity for doing good deeds in their time but instead of this they adopted the attitude of transgression and rebellion and rejected the teachings of the Messengers who had been sent for their guidance.
    - As they failed in Our test, We dismissed them from leadership. 
    - Now, O people of Arabia, your turn has come and you have replaced them and have gotten the opportunity for doing the same work under the guidance of Our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
    - You must understand that you are undergoing the same test in which your predecessors have failed. If you do not want to meet with the end they met, you should make the right use of this opportunity by learning a lesson from their end and by avoiding the errors, which became the ultimate cause of their destruction.

## Ayat 15

- `And whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who do not expect to meet Us say:`
  - `'Bring us a Qur'an other than this one, or at least make changes in it.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - They implied two things when they said these words.
        - First, they meant that what Muhammad (peace be upon him) was presenting as divine revelation was really the product of his own mind but he was ascribing it to Allah merely to make his claim weighty.
        - Secondly, they implied this: If you want to be the leader of your people, present something that may make them prosperous in the world and give up the doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter and the moral restrictions you are prescribing in your teaching. And if it is not possible, make some amendments in the Quran so that a compromise may be made between you and us on the principle of give and take so that there should be some scope for our shirk in your Tauhid and for our self worship and for our salvation in the Hereafter, irrespective of what we do in this world. You should also note it well that we cannot accept your absolute morality: therefore you should make an allowance for our prejudices, our rites and customs, our personal and national interests and our desires. We propose that with mutual agreement we should make a list of those religious demands which should be obligatory on us for the fulfillment of Allah’s rights, and beyond that we should be free to conduct our worldly affairs in any way we like. This compromise is necessary because we cannot accept your demand that human life in all its aspects should entirely be led in accordance with the implications of the doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter and the regulations of the Islamic code of life.
- `Tell them (O Muhammad):`
  - `'It is not for me to change it of my accord. I only follow what is revealed to me. Were I to disobey my Lord, I fear the chastisement of an Awesome Day.`
