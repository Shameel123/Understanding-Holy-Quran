**Ayat 11 - 20**

## Ayat 11

- `Were Allah to hasten to bring upon men (the consequence of) evil in the way men hasten in seeking the wealth of this world, their term would have long since expired.`
- **`(But that is not Our way.)`**
- `So We leave alone those who do not expect to meet Us that they may blindly stumble in their transgression.`

## Ayat 12

- `And (such is man that) when an affliction befalls him, he cries out to Us, reclining and sitting and standing.`
- `But no sooner than We have removed his affliction, he passes on as though he had never cried out to Us to remove his affliction.`
- `Thus it is that the misdeeds of the transgressors are made fair-seeming to them.`

## Ayat 13

- `Surely We destroyed the nations (which had risen to heights of glory in their times) before you`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Arabic word qarn is commonly used for the people living during the same period. But from the way the Quran has used this word on different occasions, it is evident that by qarn is, meant the community which had been invested with power and authority and appointed wholly or partially to the position of leadership of the world.
    - One way in which such a community is destroyed is that it is totally exterminated but there are other forms of its destruction also.
- `when they indulged in wrong-doing`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here the word zulm has not been used in its commonly known limited sense, but it covers all sorts of sins that are committed, when people transgress the boundaries of Allah’s slavery. Refer to (E.N. 49 of Surah Al-Baqarah).
- `and refused to believe even when their Messengers brought clear signs to them.`
- `Thus do We recompense the people who are guilty.`

## Ayat 14

- `Now We have appointed you as their successors in the earth to see how you act.`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - (Ayats 13-14) have been pointedly addressed to the Arabs so as to say,
    - “O Prophet (peace be upon him) of Arabia, learn a lesson from the communities that have passed before you. They were given an opportunity for doing good deeds in their time but instead of this they adopted the attitude of transgression and rebellion and rejected the teachings of the Messengers who had been sent for their guidance.
    - As they failed in Our test, We dismissed them from leadership. 
    - Now, O people of Arabia, your turn has come and you have replaced them and have gotten the opportunity for doing the same work under the guidance of Our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
    - You must understand that you are undergoing the same test in which your predecessors have failed. If you do not want to meet with the end they met, you should make the right use of this opportunity by learning a lesson from their end and by avoiding the errors, which became the ultimate cause of their destruction.

## Ayat 15

- `And whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who do not expect to meet Us say:`
  - `'Bring us a Qur'an other than this one, or at least make changes in it.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - They implied two things when they said these words.
        - First, they meant that what Muhammad (peace be upon him) was presenting as divine revelation was really the product of his own mind but he was ascribing it to Allah merely to make his claim weighty.
        - Secondly, they implied this: If you want to be the leader of your people, present something that may make them prosperous in the world and give up the doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter and the moral restrictions you are prescribing in your teaching. And if it is not possible, make some amendments in the Quran so that a compromise may be made between you and us on the principle of give and take so that there should be some scope for our shirk in your Tauhid and for our self worship and for our salvation in the Hereafter, irrespective of what we do in this world. You should also note it well that we cannot accept your absolute morality: therefore you should make an allowance for our prejudices, our rites and customs, our personal and national interests and our desires. We propose that with mutual agreement we should make a list of those religious demands which should be obligatory on us for the fulfillment of Allah’s rights, and beyond that we should be free to conduct our worldly affairs in any way we like. This compromise is necessary because we cannot accept your demand that human life in all its aspects should entirely be led in accordance with the implications of the doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter and the regulations of the Islamic code of life.
- `Tell them (O Muhammad):`
  - `'It is not for me to change it of my accord. I only follow what is revealed to me. Were I to disobey my Lord, I fear the chastisement of an Awesome Day.`

## Ayat 16

- `Tell them:`
  - `'Had Allah so willed, I would not have recited the Qur'an to you,`
  - `nor would Allah have informed you of it.`
  - `I have spent a lifetime among you before this.`
  - `Do you, then, not use your reason?`

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- This is a very strong argument against their accusation that Muhammad (peace be upon him) was himself the author of the Quran but was ascribing it to Allah, and in support of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) claim that it was being sent down to him by Allah, Who was its Author.
- The argument is this: You yourselves have witnessed the forty years of his life before his appointment to Prophethood. He was born in your own city and passed his boyhood, youth and middle age before your very eyes. He lived among you and had all kinds of relations, social, marital, economic, etc. with you. So much so that no aspect of his life was hidden from you. Did you notice anything in his whole life that might show that he could be the author of this Book? Do you not use your commonsense?

## Ayat 17

- `Who, then, is a greater wrong-doer than he who forges a lie against Allah or rejects His signs as false?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, if these revelations are not from Allah and I myself compose them and present them as revelations from Him, there can be no greater sinner than I am.
    - On the other hand, if these revelations are truly from Allah and you are falsifying these, then there can be no greater sinner than you.
- `Surely the guilty shall not prosper.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Some foolish people draw wrong and misleading conclusions from this verse, by a fallacious reasoning.
    - They confine the meanings of falah to long life or worldly prosperity or worldly success and argue like this: This verse declares categorically that criminals can never attain success. The converse of this proposition, that is, anyone who is successful cannot be a criminal must also be true. Hence, if a claimant should live a long life after his claim to Prophethood or prosper in the world or his claim receives a good response in the world from the people, he should be acknowledged as a true prophet.
    - For they argue, if he had been a false prophet he could not have prospered, but would have been killed or starved to death or rendered unsuccessful in his mission, as soon as he had claimed to be a prophet.
    - But even a little thinking will show that this argument is fallacious on the face of it. Firstly, the converse of every proposition is not always true. Secondly, the Quran does not use the word falah in this limited sense. Thirdly, Allah deals with the criminals according to His divine law of respite.

## Ayat 18

- `They worship, beside Allah, those who can neither harm nor profit them, saying;`
  - `'These are our intercessors with Allah.'`
- `Tell them (O Muhammad):`
  - `'Do you inform Allah of something regarding whose existence in the heavens or on the earth He has no knowledge?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This is a fine way of saying that no such intercessors exist as can plead their cases with Allah.
      - For if something is not in the knowledge of Allah, it implies that it does not exist at all, for everything that exists anywhere in the heavens and the earth is in His knowledge.
  - `Holy is He and He is exalted far above what they associate with Him in His divinity'.`

## Ayat 19

- `Once all men were but a single community;`
- `then they disagreed (and formulated different beliefs and rites).`
- `Had it not been that your Lord had already so ordained, a decisive judgement would have been made regarding their disagreements.`

## Ayat 20

- `They say:`
  - `'Why was a sign not sent down upon the prophet from His Lord?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, though they demanded a sign as a proof of the fact that he was a true Prophet (peace be upon him) and was presenting true revelations, this was not based on a genuine desire for recognizing and accepting the truth but was merely a pretext for rejecting it. For they had no intention of molding their habits, their morality, their social system, in short, reforming every aspect of their life in accordance with the implications of the acceptance of the Message of the Prophet (peace be upon him). As they did not intend to believe in it, they would say even after seeing a sign: No sign had been shown to them. Obviously, they would not give up that freedom which they were enjoying in following their desires and lusts, by accepting the unseen (the creeds of Tauhid and the Hereafter), which would bind them to the absolute moral principles.
- `Tell (such people):`
  - `'The realm of the Unseen belongs to Allah.`
  - `Wait, then; I shall wait along with you.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, I have presented before you what Allah has sent down to me. But what He has not sent down to me is unseen, both for me and for you, and it is entirely with Allah to reveal or not to reveal it. Now if you will not believe unless Allah sends down what He has not sent down, you may wait for it: I, too, shall wait and see whether your persistent demand is or is not satisfied.
