**Ayat 54 - 60**

## Ayat 54

- `If a wrong-doer had all that is in the earth he would surely offer it to ransom himself.`
- `When the wrong-doers perceive the chastisement, they will feel intense remorse in their hearts.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “And they will feel remorse”.`
    - `When all of a sudden, they face the torment on the Day, which they had denied throughout their lives, and on that presumption had gone on doing wrong deeds.
    - Not only this: they will also feel very sorry that they had denied the Messengers and brought baseless charges against them, who had warned them of it.
    - Therefore when they witness it against all their expectations, they will find the ground slipping from under their feet and will feel utterly helpless and guilty in their minds because of the remembrance of their wrong doings and of the pricking of their conscience.
    - In short, their condition will be that of a gambler, who turns a deaf ear to the counsel of his well wishers and stakes his all on mere speculation and goes bankrupt. But such a person has to blame none but himself only for his sad plight.
- `But a judgement shall be made with full justice about them.`
- `They shall not be wronged.`

## Ayat 55

- `Indeed all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah.`
- `And most certainly Allah's promise will be fulfilled, though most men are not aware.`

## Ayat 56

- `He it is Who gives life and causes death,`
- `and to Him shall you all be returned.`

## Ayat 57

- `Men!`
- `Now there has come to you an exhortation from your Lord,`
- `a healing for the ailments of the hearts,`
- `and a guidance and mercy for those who believe.`

## Ayat 58

- `Tell them (O Prophet!):`
  - `'Let them rejoice in Allah's grace and mercy through which this (Book) has come to you. It is better than all the riches that they accumulate.`

## Ayat 59

- `Did you consider that the sustenance which Allah had sent down for you`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It has been purposely avoided to translate the Arabic word rizq into provisions, for it is liable to create a very serious misunderstanding regarding the implications of this verse.
    - For in this sense rizq will be confined to food and eatables only, whereas it is very comprehensive in its meaning and it covers everything that Allah has given to man, food, children, knowledge, law etc.
    - Instances can be cited from the Quran and the traditions in support thereof.
    - Thus it has become, obvious that according to this verse, in Allah’s sight it is wrong and sinful to adopt the attitude of independence towards every kind of rizq, including articles of food.
- `of your own accord you have declared some of it as unlawful and some as lawful?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Thus it has become clear that the consequences of this misunderstanding about the meaning of rizq are farreaching.
    - As a result of this limited meaning of rizq, it will be sinful only to make the unlawful articles of food lawful and vice versa but it will not be sinful if the people become their own law makers in regards to the social, economic, political and international matters.
    - It is because of this misunderstanding that even some scholars of the Islamic law do not consider it sinful if people do not take guidance from the Sharia in regard to matters other than those of food; whereas in this verse, Allah has taken to task all those people, who arrogate to themselves the right of making lawful or unlawful not only the articles of food but anything that has been made lawful or unlawful by the Sharia.
- `Ask them:`
  - `'Did Allah bestow upon you any authority for this or do you forge lies against Allah?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The question has been posed to impress how horrible and rebellious their crime is, as if to say: How dare you make your own regulations contrary to those which Allah has given you, when, in fact, you yourselves are His creation? What do you think about the servant, who claims that he himself has the right to prescribe the limits concerning the things which his master has entrusted to his care, and therefore, there is no need of consulting him? How will you treat your own servant if he were to claim that he had every right to use and spend as he will all that belongs to you? Leave alone the case of that servant who does not acknowledge at all that he has any master, or that he is a servant, and the things that are in his possession are not his but belong to someone else; for the case under discussion does not concern such a villainous usurper.
      - The question has been posed concerning that servant who himself acknowledges that he is a servant of some master and that the things in his possession belong to the master and not to himself. Yet he claims that he has the right to make rules and regulations and set limits for himself regarding the use of those things, and that there is no need for him to consult his master.

## Ayat 60

- `Think how those who invent lies against Him will be treated on, the Day of Judgement?`
- `Allah is bountiful to men yet most of them do not give thanks.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It is a pity that most of the servants are not grateful to the Master for this great favor that He has given them full instructions about the way they should live in His house, and the use they should make of His things, and the conduct they should adopt, as if to say: If you live in the world according to My instructions, you will win My approval and deserve the greatest rewards, but if you live as rebels, you would incur My wrath and merit a painful chastisement. Nay, instead of showing gratitude for this favor, many of the servants seem to think like this: The Master ought to have left us in the world without any guidance and secretly watched us to see which of us was living in rebellion against His law, and then punished the criminals. They do not seem to realize that if the Master had put them to this hard test none would have escaped punishment.
