**Ayat 31 - 40**

## Ayat 31

- `Ask them:`
  - `'Who provides you with sustenance out of the heavens and the earth?`
  - `Who holds mastery over your hearing and sight?`
  - `Who brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living?`
  - `Who governs all affairs of the universe?'`
- `They will surely say:`
  - **`'Allah.'`**`
- `Tell them:`
  - `'Will you, then, not shun (going against reality)?"`

## Ayat 32

- `Such, then, is Allah, your true Lord.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, as you yourselves admit that Allah alone is your real Provider, Owner and Master, He alone is your true Lord, and, therefore, entitled to your servitude and worship. How have you, then, made others as partners with Him?
- `And what is there after truth but error?`
- `How, then, are you being turned away?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It should be kept in mind that these questions have been posed to the common people: therefore they are not being asked, “How are you turning away?” but “How are you turned away” The passive voice clearly shows that there must be some person (or persons) who was turning away the people from the right direction to the wrong one.
    - That is why this appeal is being made to the people: Why are you blindly following those who are misguiding you? Why don’t you use your own common sense? When you yourselves admit the truth about Allah, why don’t you consider the fact that you are being turned away from Him?

## Ayat 33

- `Thus the word of your Lord is fulfilled concerning the transgressors that they shall not believe.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, this Word of your Lord has come true that those who have made up their minds that they would not believe in any case would never believe because of their obduracy, even if the truth were to be presented before them with very plain and clear arguments.

## Ayat 34

- `Ask them:`
  - `'Is there any among those whom you associate with Allah in His divinity who brings about the creation of all beings in the first instance and will then repeat it?'`
- `Tell them:`
  - `'It is Allah Who brings about the creation of all beings and will then repeat it.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - It is to be noted that the answers to the questions posed in this and the following verse have been put in the mouth of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in contrast to the answers posed in the preceding verses.
      - This is because the mushriks themselves believed, and therefore could not deny, that Allah originated the creation and that their gods had no share in this. But they would not admit that He could or would bring it back, for they could not in that case reject the doctrine of the life-after-death, though it was obvious that the One Who originated the creation could also bring it back again, and not any one of those who had not originated it.
      - That is why the answer has been put in the mouth of the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he should declare it openly and boldly that Allah originated the creation and could and would bring it back again.
  - `How are you, then, being misled?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This question has been posed to bring home to them the folly of the doctrine of shirk. The argument is this: When Allah originates the creation and has the power to bring it back again, where do the gods you have set up come in? If you think a little, you yourselves will realize that there is no room for anyone in the universe for any claim or title to your reverence or worship or servitude.


## Ayat 35

- `Ask them:`
  - `'Are there among ones whom you associate with Allah in His divinity those who can guide to the truth?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This is one of the series of questions that have been posed to refute the doctrine of shirk and to establish the doctrine of Tauhid. Besides, it is also meant to focus attention on the importance of the guidance to the truth, which is one of the greatest human necessities. For it is obvious that the human needs and requirements are not confined to food, clothes and the like necessities of the physical life nor to its protection from losses, distresses, calamities etc.
      - But one of man’s needs (nay, his greatest need) is to have the knowledge of the right way of life so that he may, on the whole, achieve success in it. It is obvious that in order to be successful in life, man should have the correct knowledge of the use he should make of and the way he should employ his own physical, mental and spiritual powers and capabilities and natural resources. He should also know the nature and the kind of behavior he should adopt towards other human beings (and as a whole, towards the system of the universe in which he has to inevitably live and work), with whom he comes into contact in different capacities. The Quran calls that right way “The Truth” and the guidance that leads to that way, “The Guidance to the Truth”.
- `Say:`
  - `'It is Allah alone Who guides to the truth.'`
- `Then, who is more worthy to be followed - He Who guides to the truth, or he who cannot find the right way unless others guide him to it? What is wrong with you? How ill do you judge!`
