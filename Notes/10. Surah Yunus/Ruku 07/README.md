**Ayat 61 - 70**

## Ayat 61

- `(O Prophet!) Whatever you may be engaged in, whether you recite any portion of the Qur'an, or whatever else all of you are doing, We are witnesses to whatever you may be occupied with.`
- `Not even an atom's weight escapes your Lord on the earth or in the heaven, nor is there anything smaller or bigger than that, except that it is on record in a Clear Book`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - These things have been mentioned here in order to comfort the Prophet (peace be upon him) and give a warning to his enemies.
  - These are meant to lessen his worry and to strengthen him, as if to say: We see all that you are doing in propagating the Message of the truth with great patience and fortitude, and exerting your utmost to reform mankind.
  - Rest assured that We have not left you alone after entrusting you with this arduous duty.
  - We are not unaware of whatever you are doing for the performance of your mission, and also whatever your enemies are doing to oppose you. On the other hand, a warning has also been administered to his opponents:
    - Donâ€™t remain under the delusion that no one is seeing what you are doing in opposing the Messenger of the truth and the reformer of mankind? We are seeing whatever mischief you are doing and whatever obstacles you are placing in the way of the mission. We are keeping a detailed and accurate record of all these things. Therefore beware that you shall be called upon to render an account of all your doings.

## Ayat 62

- `Oh, surely the friends of Allah have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve -`

## Ayat 63

- `the ones who believe and are God-fearing.`

## Ayat 64

- `For them are glad tidings in this world and in the Hereafter.`
- `The words of Allah shall not change.`
- `That is the supreme triumph.`

## Ayat 65

- `(O Prophet!)`
- `Let not the utterances of the opponents distress you.`
- `Indeed all honour is Allah's.`
- `He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.`

## Ayat 66

- `Verily whoever dwells in the heavens or the earth belongs to Allah.`
- `Those who invoke others beside Allah, associating them with Him in His divinity, only follow conjectures and are merely guessing.`

## Ayat 67

- `It is Allah alone Who has made`
  - `the night that you may rest in it,`
  - `and has made the day light-giving.`
- `Surely in that there are signs for those who give heed (to the call of the Messenger).`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is a concise statement of a very important subject and requires a detailed explanation.
  - The Quran declares in a few words that all religions other than the revealed one are false because they have been founded on the philosophical research for the primary cause of the origin of the universe.
  - The philosophical research is after all based on guesswork, and is in its very nature incapable of reaching to the truth.
  - The right way of arriving at the truth is to make a study of the signs (e.g. day and night) and of the Message of the Prophets in a dispassionate manner.
  - For this is the only way of discovering the truth.
  - Otherwise, if one follows wrong ways, he shall always arrive at wrong conclusions. Let us now consider several methods that different people have adopted in search of this knowledge:

## Ayat 68

- `They say:`
  - `'Allah has taken a son.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - In the preceding passage people were taken to task for founding false religions on mere surmise and guesswork.
      - In this passage the Christians and others, who believe that God has begotten a son, have been taken to task for this blasphemy which has no authority other than mere presumption.
- `Glory be to Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Arabic phrase Subhan-Allah is used to express astonishment at something apparently inexplicable.
    - But its literal meaning is, Allah is All-Pure, and is absolutely free from any defect, blemish and flaw.
    - Here it implies both these things. It expresses astonishment at their blasphemy that Allah has taken a son to Himself, and also refutes it, saying, Allah, being perfect in every way, does not stand in need of a son.
- `He is self-sufficient!`
- `His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Three things have been put forward to refute their blasphemy:
- `Have you any authority to support (that Allah has taken a son)?`
- `Do you ascribe to Allah something of which you have no knowledge?`


## Ayat 69

- `Tell them (O Muhammad!):`
  - `'Indeed those who invent lies against Allah will never prosper.`

## Ayat 70

- `They may enjoy the life of this world,`
- `but in the end they must return to Us,`
- `and then We shall cause them to taste severe chastisement for their disbelieving.'`
