**Ayat 01 - 10**

## Ayat 01

- `Alif. Lam. Ra.`
- `These are the verses of the Book overflowing with wisdom.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This introductory verse contains a subtle answer to those foolish people who presumed that the discourses, which the Messenger (peace be upon him) was presenting as the Quran, were nothing more than eloquent speeches, poetic lofty thoughts, and some predictions like those of the soothsayers.
  - They are being warned that the Quran is not what they supposed it to be but this is the Book of wisdom, and that if they did not pay due attention to it, they would deprive themselves of wisdom.

## Ayat 02

- `Does it seem strange to people that We should have revealed to a man from among themselves, directing him to warn the people (who lie engrossed in heedlessness);`
- `and to give good news to the believers that they shall enjoy true honour and an exalted status with their Lord?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This question has been posed to impress on them that if they considered the matter coolly, they themselves would come to the conclusion that:
- `(Is this so strange that) the deniers of the truth should say:`
  - `'This man is indeed an evident sorcerer'?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - (a) There is nothing strange in appointing a man to warn his fellow men of the consequences of neglecting the Message. For it is obvious that a man, and not a jinn nor an angel nor any other being, was the proper messenger for human beings.

## Ayat 03

- `Surely your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then established Himself on the Throne (of His Dominion), governing all affairs of the universe.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is to impress the fact that after creating the universe, Allah has not cut off connection with it, but has sat Himself upon His Throne and is practically directing and conducting and governing each and every part of it.
    - The foolish people think that after creating the universe, Allah has left it to itself or to others to exploit it as they will. But the Quran refutes this and says that Allah Himself is governing His entire creation and He has kept all the powers and the reins of government in His own hands and whatever is taking place in each and every part of the universe is happening with His command or permission.
    - In short, He is not only the Creator but also the Ruler, Designer and Supporter of the universe, which is working in accordance with His will. See also (E.Ns 40, 41 of Surah Al-Aaaraf).
- `None may intercede with Him except after obtaining His leave.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is to emphasize the other side of the matter.
    - He is All-Powerful and there is none who dare make even a recommendation to Him about anything, not to speak of interfering with His management of affairs so as to cause any change in His decrees or in the making or marring of anyoneâ€™s fate.
    - The most one can do is to make a supplication to Him but it all depends on His will to grant or reject it.
    - There is none so powerful in His Kingdom as to have his own way in anything or to get his recommendations through anyhow.
- `Such is Allah, your Lord;`
- `do therefore serve Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - After stating the bare fact that Allah alone is the Lord, people are being told the kind of conduct that fact demands from them. That is, when Allah alone is your Lord, you should worship Him alone. In this connection, it should also be noted that just as the Arabic word Rabb implies three things namely Providence, Supremacy and Sovereignty, likewise the Arabic word ibadat also contains three corresponding implications.
- `Will you not take heed?`
