**Ayat 104 - 109**

## Ayat 104

- `(O Prophet!) Tell them:1`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this concluding portion, the same thing that was stated at the beginning of the discourse, has been reiterated. Therefore it will be worthwhile to keep in view the introductory passage (Ayats 1-10).
- `'Men! If you are still in doubt concerning my religion, know that I do not serve those whom you serve beside Allah.`
- `I only serve Allah Who will cause (all of) you to die.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Arabic word yatawaffa-kum literally means “gives you death”, but it has been purposely translated into “who causes you to die” in order to convey its real spirit in the content it occurs.
    - It implies this: I worship only that One, who has full power over your life: He has complete authority and power to let you live as long as He wills and cause you to die at any moment He wills. That is why I am fully convinced that I should submit and surrender, worship, serve and obey Him alone.
- `I have been commanded to be one of those who believe,`

## Ayat 105

- `and to adhere exclusively and sincerely to the true faith,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The force of the Arabic words “direct your face toward the religion” of the text means “dedicate yourself sincerely, exclusively and steadfastly to this faith”, is worth deep consideration.`
    - `The purpose might have been served by the use of such words as “Adopt this faith” or “Follow this faith”.
    - But Allah considered such expressions as weak and incapable of serving the real purpose, which is implied in the wording of the text. 
    - For the literal meaning is “Set your face steadfastly”, which implies: You should steadfastly turn your face in one direction only, without turning it even slightly to right or left, or backward, and go on marching in the same direction.
    - Though these words were in themselves quite sufficient, the addition of the word made it all the more forceful.
    - For hanif is one who turns away from all others and exclusively turns to one direction.
    - Thus what Allah demands is this: Adopt this faith, this way of the worship of Allah and this way of life in such a manner that your worship, subjection, submission, servitude and obedience should be dedicated exclusively to Allah, the Lord of the universe, so that you do not deviate in the least after adopting this way.
    - You should have nothing to do with those ways that you have discarded and that you should not even have a look at the crooked paths that erroneous people follow.
- `and not to be one of those who associate others with Allah in His divinity.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This negative way of forbidding from shirk has been purposely adopted. It implies this: You should not at all be one of those, who set up in any way whatsoever other gods as partners with Allah in His essence, His attributes, His rights and His powers, **whether that god be one’s own self or another man or a group of men or some spirit or jinn or angel or some material or imaginary being**.
    - The demand of Tauhid has been made both in
      - the positive form, **“Dedicate.... faith”**, and
      - in the negative form, **“and do not be of those who associate partners (to Allah).”**
    - Thus it forbids shirk both in deed and in creed, in individual and in collective life, in places of worship and in education, in courts and in legislative assemblies, in political and in economic activities.
    - Therefore it demands from the worshiper of Tauhid to adopt a different way in every aspect of life from the way of those who adulterate Godworship with ungodly worships, for the former can never be a fellow traveler with those who practice shirk. As such things can never be expected from him, it can never be imagined that he would follow them.

## Ayat 106

- `Do not call upon any apart from Allah on those who have no power to benefit or hurt you.`
- `For if you call upon others than Allah you will be reckoned among the wrong-doers.`

## Ayat 107

- **`If Allah afflicts you with any hardship, none other than He can remove it;`**
- **`and if He wills any good for you, none can avert His bounty.`**
- **`He bestows good upon whomsoever of His servants He wills.`**
- **`He is AllForgiving, All-Merciful.'`**

## Ayat 108

- `Tell them (O Muhammad):`
  - `'Men!`
  - `Truth has come to you from your Lord.`
  - `Whosoever, then, follows the true guidance does so for his own good;`
  - `and whosoever strays, his straying will be to his own hurt.`
  - `I am no custodian over you.`

## Ayat 109

- `And follow, (O Prophet!), whatever is revealed to you, and remain patient until Allah brings forth His judgement.`
- `He is the best of those who judge.'`
