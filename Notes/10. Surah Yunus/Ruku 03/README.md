**Ayat 21 - 30**


## Ayat 21

- `No sooner than We bestow mercy on a people after hardship has hit them than they begin to scheme against Our signs.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - They practiced deceptions regarding the sign of the famine that had been inflicted on them.
    - This verse alludes to the same, as if to say, “How dare you demand a sign again, whereas recently the sign of the famine has been shown to you? At that time you invoked the help of your deities but in vain, though you had set them up as intercessors with Allah and believed that offerings to their shrines would prove very effective in removing the famine. But you yourselves learned by the first hand experience that those so called gods possessed no power at all. Therefore when you were convinced that all power belongs to Allah alone, you turned to Him and began to invoke His help.
    - This experience ought to have convinced you of the truth of the Message of Muhammad (peace be upon him) for this was the very fundamental thing which he was teaching.
    - Instead of learning a lesson from this sign, you began to practice deceptions to explain it away, as soon as the famine was over and there had come the blessed rainfall.
    - You invented many explanations (deceptions) concerning the causes of the famine and its subsequent end in order to escape from the doctrine of Tauhid and stick to your shirk.
    - The verse is meant to declare that no sign would convince such people as those who had not benefited from the great sign of the famine. Therefore there was no use of showing any sign to them.
- `Tell them:`
  - `'Allah is swifter in scheming.`
  - `Our angels are recording all your intriguing.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - “Allah is more swift in plotting” means this:
        - If you practice deceptions in order to explain away the sign of the famine so that you might find excuses to evade the implications of its acceptance in order to continue your rebellious attitudes.
        - Allah is more swift in carrying out His plans to outdo your deceptive methods.
        - He will leave you free to move in your wrong ways.
        - He will even bestow upon you the worldly prosperity, which will so delude you that you will forget that you were being closely watched. And you will commit evil deeds with apparent immunity and enjoy yourselves to your heart’s content. But His angels will go on keeping a full and complete record of your deeds, which will be presented for your prosecution after your death.

## Ayat 22

- `He it is Who enables you to journey through the land and the sea.`
- `And so it happens that when you have boarded the ships and they set sail with a favourable wind, and the passengers rejoice at the pleasant voyage, then suddenly a fierce gale appears, and wave upon wave surges upon them from every side, and people believe that they are surrounded from all directions, and all of them cry out to Allah in full sincerity of faith:`
  - **`'If You deliver us from this we shall surely be thankful.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The fact that even the most obdurate mushriks and the most hardened atheists who forget Allah when things go well with them, begin to invoke Allah’s help when they are pressed hard from all sides and despair of help from any other quarter, is a clear evidence that there is the All Powerful Allah Who is controlling each and every thing in the universe. Refer to(E.N. 29, Surah Al-Anaam).

## Ayat 23

- `But no sooner than He delivers them than they go about committing excesses on the earth, acting unjustly.`
- `Men ! The excesses you commit will be of harm only to yourselves, (Enjoy, if you will) the fleeting pleasure of this world;`
- `in me end you shall all return to Us,`
- `and then We shall tell you what you did.`

## Ayat 24

- `The example of the life of this world (which has enamoured you into becoming heedless to Our signs) is that of water that We sent down from the heaven which causes the vegetation of the earth, which sustains men and cattle, to grow luxuriantly.`
- `But when the earth took on its golden raiment and became well adorned and the owners believed that they had full control over their lands Our command came upon them by night or by day, and We convened it into a stubble, as though it had not blossomed yesterday.`
- `Thus do We expound the signs for a people who reflect.`

## Ayat 25

- `(You are being lured by this ephemeral world) although Allah calls you to the abode of peace`
- `and guides whomsoever He wills to a straightway.`

## Ayat 26

- `For those who do good there is good reward and more besides;`
- `neither gloom nor humiliation shall cover their faces.`
- `They are the people of the Garden and in it they shall abide.`
