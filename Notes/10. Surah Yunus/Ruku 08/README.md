**Ayat 71 - 82**

## Ayat 71

- `And narrate to them the story of Noah`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The story of Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) has been related here to serve as a warning to those who were rejecting the Message of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
    - Up to this place, arguments had been presented before them to show the errors of their creeds, thoughts and ways, and impressive appeals had been made to them to adopt the right way.
    - But from here onward they are being warned of the consequences of the attitude they had adopted towards their Messenger and admonished indirectly to learn a lesson from the fate of Prophet Noah’s (peace be upon him) people, who had behaved towards their Prophet like the Quraish, the addressees. The Prophet had been pointing out to them in a very befitting manner their errors and deviations, and was trying to correct them. But instead of considering and reconsidering these things, they had become his mortal enemies, though he had no self-interest in his Mission and was extending the Message for their good, but they responded to his arguments with rudeness, abuses and stones.
    - So much so that his very person had become intolerable and unbearable for them. This was because of their prejudices against the right way, which had so blinded them that they could not tolerate even the presence of the one who was following the right way. At this Allah commanded His Messenger (peace be upon him) to recite to them the story of Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) so that they might get in it the answer to their misbehavior towards him.
- `when he said to his people:`
  - `'My people! If my living in your midst and my effort to shake you out of heedlessness by reciting to you the revelations of Allah offend you, then remember that I have put all my trust in Allah.`
  - `So draw up your plan in concert with those whom you associate with Allah in His divinity,`
  - `leaving no part of it obscure,`
  - `and then put it into effect against me, and give me no respite.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This was a challenge that amounted to this: I am not going to give up my mission at all, whatever you may do against me, for I have my full trust in Allah. See (Ayat 55 of Surah Hud).

## Ayat 72

- `When you turned your back on my admonition (what harm did you cause me?)`
- `I had asked of you no reward,`
- `for my reward lies only with Allah,`
- `and I am commanded to be of those who totally submit (to Allah).`

## Ayat 73

- `But they rejected Noah, calling him a liar.`
- `So We saved him and those who were with him in the Ark,`
- `and made them successors (to the authority in the land),`
- `and drowned all those who had rejected Our signs as false.`
- `Consider, then, the fate of those who had been warned (and still did not believe).`

## Ayat 74

- `Then We sent forth after him other Messengers, each one to his people.`
- `They brought to them clear signs, but they were not such as to believe in what they had rejected earlier as false.`
- `Thus do We seal the hearts of those who transgress.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The transgressors whose hearts are sealed are those obstinate and obdurate people who are so hardened against persuasion that they firmly and perversely adhere to the opinion they have once formed erroneously. As they themselves refuse to listen to counsel and admonition, Allah’s curse falls on them and they are deprived of the ability of ever coming to the right way.

## Ayat 75

- `Then, after them,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - ( E. Ns 84-111) about the story of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) and Pharaoh, already added to Surah Al- Aaraf, should be kept in view, as the things explained therein will not be repeated here.
- `We sent forth Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our signs, but they waxed proud.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “They behaved arrogantly” because of their wealth, power, pomp and show, and considered themselves above subjection to the Message. Therefore they showed haughtiness instead of surrender and obedience to it.
- `They were a wickd people.`

## Ayat 76

- `And when truth came to them from Us, they said:`
- `'Indeed this is plain sorcery.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The story of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) and Pharaoh is also being related to serve as an object lesson for the Quraish, who were behaving towards Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in the same way as Pharaoh and his people had behaved towards Prophet Moses (peace be upon him); for the response to the Message by the Quraish was similar to that of Pharaoh’s people. Refer to (Ayat 2 of this Surah).

## Ayat 77

- `Moses said:`
  - `'Do you say this about the truth after it has come to you?`
  - `Is this sorcery?`
  - `You call this sorcery although sorcerers never come to a happy end.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- “And the sorcerers will not succeed” is meaningful for this is the answer to their charge: “Is this a sorcery.”
- It means this: You have called the signs presented by Moses (peace be upon him) a sorcery on account of its apparent likeness to it. You have not considered the clear and marked distinctions between the characteristics of the Prophets and sorcerers.
- Otherwise you would never have dared to make such an absurd charge. 
- Have you ever seen a sorcerer go before a tyrant and talk boldly and fearlessly to him as Moses (peace be upon him) did, and admonish him for his deviation and invite him to adopt the way of purity and God-worship?
- You know that a sorcerer behaves quite differently. He starts with the flattery of the courtiers so that they may obtain for him the permission to show his tricks.
- After this he goes to the presence of His Majesty and makes obsequious bows and very humbly requests him to see his tricks. Then he prays for his long life and prosperity and begs for his reward.
- Now, you can judge for yourselves whether the Prophet is a sorcerer or a far greater and far higher personality than even kings and the like.

## Ayat 78

- `They replied:`
  - `'Have you come to turn us away from the way of our forefathers that the two of you might become supreme in the land?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - It is obvious that if this demand had been merely for the liberation of the Israelites, there could have been no question of any threat to Pharaoh’s kingdom.
      - The threat was because of the message which demanded subordination to the truth, for it threatened the system which was based on shirk and on which depended the domination of Pharaoh and his chiefs and priests. See (E.N. 66 of Surah Al-Aaraf) and (E.N. 43 of Surah Al-Momin).
  - `We shall never accept what the two of you say.'`

## Ayat 79

- `And Pharaoh said (to his) men:`
  - `'Bring every skilled sorcerer to me.'`

## Ayat 80

- `And when the sorcerers came Moses said to them:`
  - `'Cast whatever you wish to cast.'`

## Ayat 81

- `Then when they had cast (their staffs), Moses said:`
  - `'What you have produced is sheer sorcery.1`
  - `Allah will certainly reduce it to naught.`
  - `Surely Allah does not set right the work of the mischief-makers.`

## Ayat 82

- `Allah vindicates the truth by His commands, howsoever much the guilty might detest that.'`
