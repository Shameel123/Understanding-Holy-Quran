**Ayat  51 - 77**


## Ayat 51

- `Messengers!`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In the preceding passage (verses 23-50), the stories of some Prophets have been related as individuals, but in this verse all of them have been addressed together. However, it does not mean that they were present at one and the same place at the time of address. As a matter of fact, this way of address has been adopted to show that the message of all the Messengers, who came to different countries in different ages, was the same and they all belonged to one and the same community, (verse 52). Therefore the message to one Messenger was meant to be the message for each one of them.
    - In this verse, they have been addressed together as if they were present at one and the same place in order to emphasize this same aspect of the matter. But it is an irony that some people of this age have concluded that this verse has been addressed to those messengers who were to come after Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It is obvious that this interpretation cannot fit in the context in which the verse occurs.
- `Partake of the things that are clean, and act righteously.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Pure things” implies that they should be wholesome and must have been earned in lawful ways. Here the instruction, “eat of the pure things”, is meant to refute the theory and practice of asceticism. 
    - The Quran teaches the middle way between the life of asceticism and that of licence. The fact that the instruction, “eat of the pure things”, precedes “do righteous deeds”, is meant to impress that righteous deeds are meaningless without eating lawful provisions.
    - **The Prophet (peace be upon him) impressed this very thing by saying: O people, Allah is pure and loves pure things. Then he recited this (verse 51) and said: A person makes a long pilgrimage in a disheveled condition and prays with raised hands, O my Lord, O my Lord, whereas he eats unlawful food, wears unlawful clothes and has been brought up on unlawful provisions. How can such a one expect that Allah will grant his prayer?** (Related by Abu Hurairah).
- `I know well all that you do.`

## Ayat 52

- `This community of yours is one community,`
- `and I am your Lord;`
- `so hold Me alone in fear.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The original Arabic word ummat (community) comprises those individuals who have some basic things common among them. All the Messengers of Allah belonged to one and the same community because they had the same creed and the same religion and the same message. 
  - See also (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayats 130-133, 213); (Surah Aal-Imran, Ayats 19-20, 33-34, 64,79-85); (Surah An- Nisa, Ayats 150-152); (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 59, 65, 73, 85); (Surah Yusuf, Ayats 37-40); (Surah Maryam, Ayats 49-59); and (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 71-93) along with the relevant E.Ns.

## Ayat 53

- `But people later cut up their religion into bits,`
- `each group rejoicing in what they have.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is not a mere statement of a fact, but it is a link of the same argument which is being put forward from the very beginning of the Surah.
  - The argument is this:
    - Islam has been the real and original religion of all the Prophets from Noah to Jesus (peace be upon them all), because all of them brought and taught the same doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter. 
    - On the contrary, all the other religions are the perversions of the real and original religion, which has been tampered with in many ways.
    - Therefore, those who are following the perverted religions are in the wrong and not the Prophet (peace be upon him) who is inviting them to the real and original religion.

## Ayat 54

- `So leave them immersed in their heedlessness till an appointed time.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There is a gap between (verses 53 and 54), which has been left to the listener to fill, because the background of the whole discourse itself helps to fill it.
  - Five years had passed since the Prophet (peace be upon him) had been inviting his people to the original religion. He had left no stone unturned to convince them by reasoning and by historical evidence that his message was based on the truth. His people had seen the practical results of the acceptance of his message and had witnessed his own high character which was by itself a guarantee that he was a trustworthy man.
  - But in spite of all this, his people were rejoicing in their erroneous beliefs which they had inherited from their forefathers. This was not all. They had become his bitter enemies and were trying to defeat him and his message by every wicked machination.

## Ayat 55

- `Do they fancy that Our continuing to give them wealth and children (means) that`

## Ayat 56

- `We are busy lavishing on them all kinds of good? Nay, they do not perceive the reality of the matter.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This question has been posed as a proof of the main theme of the Surah. It is meant to remove their misconception of success, welfare and prosperity, which the disbelievers had formed to delude themselves.
  - According to them, the one, who enjoyed the good things of life and wielded power and influence in the society, had attained success. On the other hand, the he who was deprived of these things was a failure.
  - This misconception had involved them in another serious misunderstanding. They thought that the one who had attained success was in the right, and the beloved of Allah. Otherwise, how could he have attained all the successes? On the contrary, the one who was apparently deprived of these things was surely wrong in his creed and erroneous in his deeds, and was under the wrath of God (or gods).
  - As this misconception is one of the greatest deviations of the materialists, the Quran has stated it and refuted it in different ways at different places and made the reality plain.
  - For instance, see (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayats 126, 212); (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 32); (Surah At- Taubah, Ayats 55, 69, 85); (Surah Yunus, Ayat 17); (Surah Houd, Ayats 3, 27-31, 38-39);(Surah Ar-Rad, Ayat 26); (Surah Al-Kahf, Ayats 28, 32-43, 103-105);(Surah Maryam, Ayats 77-80); (Surah Ta-Ha, Ayats 131-132);(Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayat 44) along with the relevant E.Ns. In order to remove the above mentioned misconceptions one should keep in view the following.

## Ayat 57

- `Surely those who stand in awe for fear of their Lord,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, they do not live a carefree life devoid of the fear of God. They live in awe of Him and are fully conscious that He oversees and watches them in all their motives and actions and they are thus deterred from thinking and doing evil.


## Ayat 58

- `who have full faith in the Signs of their Lord;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Signs here means both divine revelations to the Prophets and the signs found in man’s own self and in the universe around him.
  - To believe in the verses of the Book is to affirm them, and to believe in the signs of human self and the universe is to affirm the realities which they point to.

## Ayat 59

- `who associate none with their Lord in His Divinity,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Though belief in the revelations itself ingrains the doctrine of Tauhid in the hearts, yet the believers have been warned to guard against shirk.
  - This is because, in spite of believing in the revelations, man is inclined to commit shirk in one form or the other, for instance, in exaggerating the teachings of the Prophets and righteous people, supplicating and serving others than Allah, etc.

## Ayat 60

- `who give, whatever they give in charity,`
- `with their hearts trembling at the thought that they are destined to return to their Lord;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse (60) may be elaborated like this: They serve their Lord and try their best to obey Him and do righteous deeds, but all along they remain humble in their hearts and are not puffed up with the pride of their piety. Nay, in spite of all their good deeds, their hearts are always filled with awe that they shall have to render an account to their Lord, and they are not sure whether they will come out successful in the judgment of their Lord or not.
  - A concrete interpretation of this verse is afforded by Umar. Although he served his Allah in a way that was exemplary, yet he was so afraid of accountability to Him that he is reported to have said before death: I shall consider it a favor, if I am neither rewarded nor punished in the Hereafter.
  - **Hasan Basri has expressed the same thing in a beautiful manner: A believer obeys Allah and is yet fearful of Him, and a hypocrite disobeys Allah and is yet fearless of Him.**

## Ayat 61

- `it is these who hasten to do good works and vie in so doing with one another.`

## Ayat 62

- `We do not lay a burden on anyone beyond his capacity.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The enunciation of this fundamental proposition, in the context in which it occurs, is very meaningful.
    - In the preceding passage (verses 57-61), the characteristics of those people, who deserve true success, have been stated, and in this (verse 62), it has been made clear that those excellent qualities can be attained by anyone who tries to achieve true success, as if to say: The conditions We have laid down for true success are within the reach of those who strive for it, for “We do not lay a burden”. Therefore if you, O disbelievers, desire to achieve true success, you should follow the example of the believers from among yourselves, who have really attained it.
- `We have a Book with Us that speaks the truth(about everyone);`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - According to the Quran, an elaborate conduct book of every individual is being maintained accurately. This records every word he utters, every deed or act he performs, even every hidden thought and intention that he cherishes in his heart and mind. See also (Surah Al-Kahf, Ayat 49 and E.N. 46) thereof.
- `and they shall in no wise be wronged.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, neither a person will be accused of and punished for something he had not done, nor will he be deprived of the full reward of a good act that he had done.

## Ayat 63

- `Nay, their hearts are lost in ignorance of all this;1`
- `and their deeds too vary from the way (mentioned above).`
- `They will persist in these deeds`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - They are heedless that everything they are saying and doing, is being recorded in some book and that they shall have to render an account of everything. 

## Ayat 64

- `until We seize with Our chastisement those of them that are given to luxuriant ways.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The epicureans will probably be punished in this worldly life because in the enjoyment of luxury and pleasure they forgot the rights of the other people and transgressed the prescribed limits.
- `They will then begin to groan.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Juar is bellowing by a bull painfully. Here the word has been used tauntingly for a groaning person who does not deserve any mercy, as if to say: Now that you are going to be punished for your misdeeds, you have started bellowing.

## Ayat 65

- `"Put a stop to your groaning now!`
- `Surely no help shall be provided to you from Us.`

## Ayat 66

- `My Signs were rehearsed to you and you turned back on your heels and took to flight,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is to say, in the worldly life you did not pay any heed to what the Messenger said.
  - Nay, you did not even like to hear his voice.

## Ayat 67

- `behaving arrogantly,`
- `and making fun,`
- `and talking nonsense (about the Book in your nightly chats)."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The meeting places where the people of Makkah gathered together at night to hold consultations, to gossip and tell tales, etc.

## Ayat 68

- `Did they never ponder over this Word1 (of God)?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, do they mean to imply that they reject the message because they do not understand it?
    - Whereas the Quran is not an enigma, nor is it being presented in an incomprehensible language, nor does it deal with themes and subjects which are beyond human understanding. The fact is that they understand everything it presents, but they oppose and reject it, because they have no intention to follow and believe what it presents.
- `Or has he (to wit, the Messenger) brought something the like of which did not come to their forefathers2 of yore?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, is the Quran presenting something which they had never heard before? No, that is not so. Allah had been sending His messages through His Prophets, who came to Arabia and in the adjoining lands and they are well acquainted with them, especially with Prophets Abraham and Ismael, and Houd, Saleh and Shoaib (peace be upon them all), who are acknowledged by them as Prophets of God, and who were not idol worshipers but enjoined the worship of One God.
    - For further explanation, see(E.N. 84 of Surah Al-Furqan),(E.N. 5 of Surah As-Sajdah )and(E.N. 35 of Surah Saba).

## Ayat 69

- `Or is it that they were unaware of their Messenger and were therefore repelled by him for he was a stranger to them?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, do they reject the message because Muhammad (peace be upon him), who is inviting them to it, is a stranger among them?
  - No, this is not so, for he was born and bred among them in a noble family. He bears a pure and high character. He has been truthful, upright, trustworthy, honest and morally chaste throughout his life, He is a noble and gentle person, peace-loving and just by nature, honest in word and deed, sympathetic and helpful to the weak and poor. And they themselves testified to all this before he claimed to be a Messenger of Allah. Then he has been consistently preaching the same message from the first day of his mission. Then whatever he has preached, he has first practiced it himself and demonstrated its truth. There has been no contradiction between his word and deed. He and his followers have faithfully and honestly put into practice the message of the Quran and shown excellent results.
  - For further details, see (E.N. 21 of Surah Al-Anaam), (E.N. 21 of Surah Yunus) and (E.N. 105 of Surah Bani Israil).

## Ayat 70

- `Or do they say that there is madness in him?1`
- `Nay, he has brought them the Truth and it is the Truth that most of them disdain.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, do they reject his message because they regard Muhammad (peace be upon him) to be possessed by a jinn?
  - No, this is also not correct, because in their hearts, they themselves regard him as a wise and sagacious person. It is therefore ridiculous to regard a man like him to be possessed by a jinn. For, such a person cannot say wise things and do noble deeds like him. How strange that a person possessed by a jinn (or having epileptic fits according to the western orientalists) should utter and recite sublime discourses of the Quran and start and guide a successful movement which should revolutionize the way of life not only of his own people but of the whole world.

## Ayat 71

- `Were the Truth to follow their desires, the order of the heavens and the earth and those who dwell in them would have been ruined.`
- `Nay, the fact is that We have brought to them their own remembrance;`
- `and yet it is from their own remembrance that they are turning away.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This brief sentence expresses a great reality which should be understood well.
  - The foolish people in the world generally feel offended by a person who points out the truth to them. They do not like to hear and consider the truth because it goes against their desires and interests but the truth remains the truth and cannot be changed after one's personal whims and wishes. Man is subject to the eternal and unalterable laws operating in the universe and has therefore to adjust his thinking, desires and conduct accordingly and should try to discover the truth and reality through experience, reasoning and observation. Only a foolish person can stick to and regard his personal whims, wishes and prejudices to be the reality and refuse to hear and consider any argument, however rational and scientific, simply because it goes against them. 

## Ayat 72

- `Are you asking them for something?`
- `What Allah has given you is the best.`
- `He is the Best of providers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This was yet another proof of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Prophethood. He was conveying the message without demanding any recompense for it, and he had no self interest in it. Nay, he had staked his business, reputation, peaceful home life, relationships with the unbelieving kindred for the success of his mission and was being ruthlessly persecuted for its sake.
  - A selfish person could not have risked his all for the sake of only worldly motives. He would rather have exploited the racial and tribal prejudices of his people to become their ruler and leader. On the contrary, his message not only cut at the root of those prejudices but tended to destroy the very bases which helped his tribe to wield influence and authority over the polytheists of Arabia.
  - This is an argument which the Quran has advanced again and again as a proof of the truth of the mission of the other Prophets as well. See(Surah Al-Anaam, Ayat 90); (Surah Yunus, Ayat 72);(Surah Hud, Ayats 29, 51);(Surah Yusuf, Ayat 104);(Surah Ya-Seen, Ayat 21) along with the relevant E.Ns.

## Ayat 73

- `You are calling them to a Straight Way,`

## Ayat 74

- `but those who do not believe in the Hereafter are ever prone to deviate from the Right Way.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This was the real reason why they were deviating from the right path. As they did not believe in the Hereafter, they thought that no account would be taken from them of what they did in this world. 
  - Therefore it did not matter whether they followed the truth or falsehood. Their only aim in life was to gratify the lusts of the flesh and gratify them in the best way possible.

## Ayat 75

- `Were We to be merciful to them and remove from them their present afflictions,`
- `they would persist in their transgression, blindly wandering on.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The affliction alluded to in this verse was the famine which occurred in Makkah some time after the advent of Prophethood. 
  - According to Abdullah bin Masud, when the Quraish persistently refused to accept the invitation of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and started putting up stiff resistance,
  - he prayed: O Allah, help me against them with a seven year famine like the seven year famine of the time of Prophet Joseph. So a severe famine started in Makkah with the result that people were obliged to eat carrion.
  - This famine has been alluded to in a number of Makki Surahs. For instance see(Surah Al-Anaam, Ayats 42-44); (Surah Al- Aaraf, Ayats 94-99);(Surah Yunus, Ayats 11, 12, 21); (Surah An-Nahl, Ayats 112-113) and (Surah Ad-Dukhan, Ayats 10- 16 )along with the relevant E.Ns.

## Ayat 76

- `(They are such) that We seized them with chastisement (and yet) they did not humble themselves before their Lord, nor do they entreat`

## Ayat 77

- `until We opened upon them the door of a severe chastisement.`
- `Then lo, in this state they become utterly despaired of any good.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Arabic word mublis is used for one whom frustration makes so desperate and obdurate that he does not hesitate to resort to any crime. The Devil has been called Iblis for the same reason.
