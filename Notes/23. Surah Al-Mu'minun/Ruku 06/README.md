**Ayat  93 - 118**


## Ayat 93

- `Pray, (O Muhammad):`
  - **`"My Lord, if You should bring the scourge of which they had been warned in my presence,`**

## Ayat 94

- **`then do not include me, my Lord, among these wrong-doing people."`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This prayer does not mean that, God forbid, there was any real danger of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) also being involved in the punishment, or that if he had not invoked this prayer, he might have been involed in it.
  - This way of address has been adopted to warn that all people should fear Allah’s punishment. nThey should not demand it nor persist in their wickedness, if Allah gives them respite.
  - As a matter of fact, Allah’s punishment is a thing which should be dreaded not only by the sinful people but also by the righteous people, and they should all seek His refuge from it, for when the scourge of God comes, it does not destroy only the wicked people but may also involve the righteous people in it.
  - Therefore the right course for those, who have to live in a wicked society, is that they should always pray to Allah for His refuge, for one does not know when that scourge might come down.

## Ayat 95

- `Surely We are able to show you what We warn them against.`

## Ayat 96

- `(O Muhammad)!`
- `Repel evil in the best manner.`
- `We are well aware of all that they say about you.`

## Ayat 97

- `And pray:`
  - **`"My Lord! I seek Your refuge from the suggestions of the evil ones;`**

## Ayat 98

- **`I even seek Your refuge, my Lord, lest they should approach me."`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For explanation, see(E.Ns 71, 72 of Surah Al-Anaam); (E.Ns 138, 150 to 153 of Surah Al-Aaraf);(E.N. 39 of Surah Younus); (E.N. 48 of Surah Al-Hijr); (E.Ns 122 to 124 of Surah An-Nahl); (E.Ns 58 to 63 of Surah Bani-Israil) and (E.Ns 35 to 41 of Surah HaMim-Sajdah).

## Ayat 99

- `(They shall persist in their deeds) until when death comes to anyone of them he will say:`
  - **`"My Lord, send me back to the world`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In the original text plural number has been used for Allah, which may be for reverence, or may include the angels as well, who will be seizing the criminal soul. 
  - The entreaty would be: O my Lord! Send me back.

## Ayat 100

- `that I have left behind. I am likely to do good."`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It occurs at several places in the Quran that each of the criminals, after his death till his entry into Hell, and even after that, will plead again and again: Lord, send me back to the world, I will no more disobey Thee, I will now do righteous deeds.
      - See (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayats 27, 28); (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 53); (Surah Ibrahim, Ayats 44, 45); (Surah Ash-Shuara, Ayat 102); (Surah Al-Fatir, Ayat 37);(Surah Az- Zumar, Ayats 58, 59);(Surah Al-Momin, Ayats 10-12), and (Surah Ash-Shura, Ayats 44 )along with the relevant E.Ns.
- `Nay,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, he will never be sent back nor given another opportunity, for in that case the test and trial for which man is sent to this world becomes meaningless.
      - For further explanation, see(Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 210 and E. N. 228 )thereof, and (E.Ns 6, 139, 140 of Surah Al-Anaam) and(E.N. 26 of Surah Younus).
- `it is merely a word that he is uttering.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, now, when he has met his doom, he has nothing more to say than that he should be sent back to the world; so let him say what he likes; he will never be allowed to go back.
- `There is a barrier behind all of them (who are dead) until the Day when they will be raised up.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, now there is a barrier between them and the world, which will not allow them to go back to it. Therefore they shall remain in that state until the Day of Resurrection.

## Ayat 101

- `And then no sooner the Trumpet is blown than`
- `there will remain no kinship among them that Day,`
- `nor will they ask one another.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It does not mean that the father will not remain father and the son will not remain son, etc.
  - It only means that they will not be able to help each other, nor shall they be able to inquire about each other as father and son, for each one will be worried and anxious about his own plight.
    - See (Surah Al-Maarij, Ayats 10-14), and (Surah Abasa, Ayats 34- 37).

## Ayat 102

- `It will be an Hour when those whose scales are heavy,`
- `they alone will attain success;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, those whose good deeds will be heavy and will out-weigh their evil deeds.

## Ayat 103

- `and those whose scales are light,`
- `those will be the ones who will have courted loss.`
- `They will abide in Hell.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For the criterion of success and failure in the Hereafter, please refer to( E.Ns 1 and 50 )above. 

## Ayat 104

- `The Fire shall scorch their faces, exposing their jaws.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The word kalih means a face whose skin has been removed so as to expose the jaws. 
  - When somebody asked Abdullah bin Masud the meaning of kalih, he said: Haven’t you seen the scorched head of a slaughtered animal?

## Ayat 105

- `"Are you not those to whom My revelations were recited, and you dubbed them as lies?"`

## Ayat 106

- `They will say:`
  - `"Our Lord! Our misfortune prevailed over us. We were indeed an erring people.`

## Ayat 107

- `Our Lord! Take us out of this.`
- `Then if we revert (to evil-doing) we shall indeed be wrongdoers."`

## Ayat 108

- `Allah will say:`
  - `"Away from Me; stay where you are and do not address Me.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Do not speak to Me”: Do not plead your case with Me. According to some traditions, these will be their last words and they shall never be allowed to speak again, but this is contradicted by the Quran itself in the succeeding verses. Therefore, it only means this that they will not be able to plead their case again.

## Ayat 109

- `You are those that when a party of My servants said:`
  - **`'Our Lord, we believe, so forgive us, and have mercy on us, for You are the Best of those that are merciful,'`**

## Ayat 110

- `you made a laughingstock of them`
- `and your hostility to them caused you to forget Me,`
- `and you simply kept laughing.`

## Ayat 111

- `Lo!`
- `I have rewarded them this Day for their steadfastness,`
- `so that they, and they alone, are triumphant."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is again a reference to those who will deserve success or be doomed to failure in the Hereafter.

## Ayat 112

- `Then Allah will ask them:`
  - **`"For how many years did you stay on earth?"`**

## Ayat 113

- `They will say:`
  - `"We stayed for a day or part of a day.`
  - `Ask of those who keep count of this."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For explanation, see (Surah Ta-Ha Ayat 103 and E.N. 80) thereof. 

## Ayat 114

- `He will say:`
  - `"You stayed only for a while, if you only knew that.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, Our Messengers warned you that the life in this world is transitory and is for test and trial, but you did not realize it then and denied that there was any life in the Hereafter and behaved in accordance with that belief. 

## Ayat 115

- `Did you imagine that We created you without any purpose,`
- `and that you will not be brought back to Us?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Arabic word abathan in the text also means “for the sake of sport”.
  - Then the verse will mean: Did you think that We had created you merely for the sake of sport and there was no purpose behind your creation?
  - Therefore you may eat, drink, be merry and enjoy yourself as you please.


## Ayat 116

- **`So, exalted be Allah,`**
- **`the True King!`**
- **`There is no god but He,`**
- **`the Lord of the Great Throne.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Allah is above this that He should create you without any purpose and that you may associate partners with Him with impunity.

## Ayat 117

- `He who invokes any other god along with Allah`
- `"one for whom he has no evidence"`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It may also be translated as: The one who invokes any other deity along with Allah, has nothing to support him in this act.
- `his reckoning is with his Lord alone.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, he cannot escape accountability.
- `Indeed, these unbelievers shall not prosper.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Again, the reference is to those who will attain the success and to those who will be deprived of it.

## Ayat 118

- `And say, (O Muhammad): "My Lord, forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the Best of those that are merciful."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Compare and contrast this prayer with (verse 109).
  - Here the Prophet (peace be upon him) has been told to make the same prayer as contained in (verse 109), as if to say, You (and your followers) should supplicate Allah with the same prayer so that, if the people scoff at you, they themselves might provide a proof of a strong case against themselves.
