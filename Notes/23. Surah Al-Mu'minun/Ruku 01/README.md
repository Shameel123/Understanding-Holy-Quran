**Ayat  01 - 22**

## Ayat 01


- `The believers have indeed attained true success:`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Believers”, who have attained true success, are those who have accepted the message of Muhammad (peace be upon him), and have acknowledged him as their guide and followed the way of life taught by him.
  - The noble characteristics of the believers pointed out in (verses 2-9 )are the arguments to prove the above assertion. In other words, it has been stated that people with such and such traits and qualities only can attain true success in this world and in the Hereafter.


## Ayat 2

- `those who, in their Prayers, humble themselves;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Khashiun in the text is from khushu (to bow down, to express humility) which is a condition of the heart as well as of the body. 
  - Khushu of the heart is to fear and stand in awe of a powerful person and khushu of the body is to bow his head and lower his gaze and voice in his presence.
  - In Salat one is required to show khushu both of the heart and of the body, and this is the essence of the Prayer.
  - It has been reported that when the Prophet (peace be upon him) once saw a person offering his Prayer as well as playing with his beard, he remarked: **If he had khushu in his heart, his body would have manifested it.**

## Ayat 3

- `who avoid whatever is vain and frivolous;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Literally, laghv is anything nonsensical, meaningless and vain, which is in no way conducive to achieving one’s goal and purpose in life.
  - The believers pay no heed to such useless things and they show no inclination or interest for them.
  - If by chance they see such things being indulged in, they keep away and avoid them scrupulously, or treat them with utmost indifference. This attitude has been described in(Surah Al-Furqan, Ayat 72), thus: 
  - If they have to pass by what is vain, they pass by like dignified people.

## Ayat 4

- `who observe Zakah;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The word Zakat literally means purification and development, to help something grow up smoothly and develop without obstruction.
  - As an Islamic term, it implies both the portion of wealth taken out for the purpose of purifying the rest of wealth and the act of purification itself.
  - The words of the original text mean that the believer constantly practices purification.
  - Thus the meaning is not confined to the paying off of Zakat dues only but it is extended to self purification which includes purification of morals as well as wealth, property and life in general.
  - Then it does not mean purification of one’s own self, but includes the purification of the lives of other people as well.
  - So the verse means: **The believers are the people who purify themselves as well as others.**
  - This thing has also been stated at other places in the Quran, for instance:
    - **Successful is he who practiced purification and remembered his Lord and prayed.**
      - (Surah Al-Aala, Ayats 14-15).
  -  And:
     -  **Successful is he who purified himself and failure is he who corrupted it.**
        -  (Surah Ash-Shams, Ayats 9-10).
  - But this verse is more comprehensive in meaning because it stresses the purification of both society and one’s own person.

## Ayat 5

- `who strictly guard their private parts`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - They are modest in every sense of the word.
  - They are free from sex abuse and sex perversion.
  - They are so modest that they even conceal those parts of their bodies which the law forbids to expose before others.
  - For explanation, see(E.Ns 30 and 32 of Surah An-Noor).


## Ayat 6

- `save from their wives, or those whom their right hands possess; for with regard to them they are free from blame "`

## Ayat 7

- `As for those who seek beyond that, they are transgressors"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is a parenthesis which is meant to remove the common misunderstanding that sex desire is an evil thing in itself and satisfying it even in lawful ways is not desirable, particularly for the righteous and godly people.
  - This misunderstanding would have been strengthened, had it been only said that the believers guard their private parts scrupulously, because it would have implied that they live unmarried lives, away from the world, like monks and hermits.
  - Therefore a parenthesis has been added to say that there is nothing wrong in satisfying the sex desire in lawful ways. What is evil is that one should transgress the prescribed limits for satisfying the sex desire.

## Ayat 8

- `who are true to their trusts and their covenants,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The believers fulfill the terms of the trusts which are placed in their charge.
  - In this connection it should be noted that the Arabic word amanat is very comprehensive and includes all those trusts which are placed in their charge by Allah or society or individuals.
  - Likewise aahd includes all those compacts, pledges, and promises which are made between Allah and man, and man and man.
  - The Prophet (peace be upon him) himself used to impress the importance of the fulfillment of pledges in his addresses:
    - **The one, who does not fulfil the terms of his trust, has no faith, and the one, who does not keep promises and pledges has no Islam.** (Baihaqi).
  - According to a tradition reported both by Bukhari and Muslim, he said: Four characteristics are such that if a person has all four in him, he is beyond any doubt a hypocrite, and the one who has one of these, is a hypocrite to that extent till he gives it up:

## Ayat 9

- `and who guard their Prayers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Salawat is plural of Salat.
  - In (verse 2) the act of Salat itself was implied, but here the plural number implies the individual Prayers offered in their own times.
  - They strictly guard their Prayers: they strictly adhere to the prescribed times of the Prayers: they perform them with due regard for their pre-requisites, conditions and articles with clean body and dress and necessary ablutions: they do not regard their Prayers as an unnecessary burden, which has to be cast off somehow: they do not recite mechanically but understand what they recite and are conscious that they are supplicating to their Lord like humble servants. 

## Ayat 10

- `Such are the inheritors`

## Ayat 11

- `that shall inherit Paradise;`
- `and in it they shall abide for ever.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Firdaus (Paradise) is a common word found in almost all human languages in very nearly similar forms.
  - It means a vast garden adjoining the dwelling of a person and enclosed by defence walls and containing all kinds of fruit trees, especially vines.
  - In some languages, the word has the sense of containing pet birds and animals, too.
  - Firdaus was in common use in pre-Islamic Arabic literature.
  - The Quran, however, has used it for a plurality of gardens as in (Surah Al-Kahf, Ayat 107). This gives the idea that Firdaus is a vast place containing a great number of gardens, vineyards, etc. The inheritance of Paradise by believers has been explained in detail in (E.N. 83 of Surah TaHa) and (E.N. 99 of Surah Al- Anbiya).

## Ayat 12

- `We created man out of the extract of clay,`

## Ayat 13

- `then We made him into a drop of life-germ,`
- `then We placed it in a safe depository,`

## Ayat 14

- `then We made this drop into a clot,`
- `then We made the clot into a lump,`
- `then We made the lump into bones,`
- `then We clothed the bones with flesh,`
- `and then We caused it to grow into another creation.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Now let the disbelievers consider the message of the Prophet (peace be upon him) by observing their own creation, for this will convince them of its truth by proving its doctrine of Tauhid.
    - The origin of man is from a mere inanimate sperm-drop, which undergoes several changes in the womb of the mother. But after this, when it sees the light of the day, it is quite a different creation from the embryo in the womb. Now it can hear, it can see, and in due course of time it can talk and think. Then, when he reaches adulthood and maturity, he is capable of performing wonderful deeds.
    - **It is obvious that Allah alone could create all these characteristics in an inanimate sperm-drop.**
- **`Thus Most Blessed is Allah, the Best of all those that create.`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The various stages of the creation of man have been cited to prove that **Allah is All-Blessed** and there is no human language which can describe the praise of which He is worthy, as if to say: 
      - That Allah Who is able to develop an essence of clay into a perfect man, does not have any partner in His Godhead.
      - Moreover, He has the power to raise him up again after his death, and is capable of working even greater wonders.

## Ayat 15

- `Thereafter you are destined to die,`

## Ayat 16

- `and then on the Day of Resurrection you shall certainly be raised up.`
- 
## Ayat 17

- `We have indeed fashioned above you seven paths.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The original Arabic word taraiq has more than one meaning.
    - It may refer to the paths of the seven planets, with which the man of the time of the revelation of the Quran was familiar, or to the seven heavens.
    - It should be noted that this word has not been used as a modern scientific term, but as a common word according to the Arabic usage of the period in order to invite the people’s attention to the wonders of the heavens, whose creation is certainly a greater thing than the creation of men. (Surah Al-Hijr, Ayat 57).
- `Never were We unaware of the task of creation.2`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This may also be translated as: **We were not nor are heedless of Our creation.**
    - According to the first translation, it will mean that the whole of the creation has been brought about in a perfect manner with a definite design and purpose. For Allah, their Creator, is perfect in every respect. The creation itself a proof that it is not the work of a novice or an inexpert. All the physical laws of the entire system of the universe are so closely interconnected as to prove that it is the creation of the All-Wise Allah.
    - If we take the second translation, it will mean that Allah has not been heedless in making provisions for every thing according to its nature from the most insignificant to the greatest of all.

## Ayat 18

- `We sent down water from the sky in right measure, and caused it to stay in the earth,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The water may refer to the rainfall, which comes down every now and then.
    - It may also refer to the great store of water which Allah sent down at the time of the creation of the earth to fulfill its various needs till the Last Day, and which still exists in the shape of seas, lakes, sub-soil water, etc.
    - It is the same water which evaporates in summer and freezes in winter and is carried by winds from place to place and spread over the earth by rivers, springs and wells to cause the growth of multitudes of things, and then is again restored to the seas, lakes, etc.
    - Neither has this store of water been decreased by a drop nor was there any need to increase it by a drop since its creation.
    - Today it is too well known how water comes about by the combination of oxygen and hydrogen in a certain ratio.
    - **The question is why can’t more water be produced when oxygen and hydrogen still exist in abundance in the world?**
    - **Who caused them to combine in the proper ratio in the beginning to produce oceans of water and who now stops them from coming together to produce an extra drop?**
    - **Then when water evaporates, who causes oxygen and hydrogen to remain combined in water vapors even in the gaseous state. Do the atheists and polytheists, who believe in independent deities for water, air, summer and winter, have any answer to this question?**
- `and We have the power to cause it to vanish (in the manner We please).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is to warn that Allah is able to take away the water if He so wills, and deprive the world of its most important means of life. 
    - Thus, this verse is more comprehensive in meaning than (verse 30 of Surah Al-Mulk):
      - **Ask them, have you ever considered that if the water of your wells should sink down into the earth, who would then restore to you running springs of water?**

## Ayat 19

- `Then through water We caused gardens of date-palms and vines to grow for you`
- `wherein you have an abundance of delicious fruits`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, other kinds of fruits than dates and grapes.
- `and from them you derive your livelihood.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you sustain yourselves by the produce that you get from these gardens in the shape of fruit, corn, wood, etc.

## Ayat 20

- `And We also produced the tree which springs forth from Mount Sinai, containing oil and sauce for those that eat.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the olive-tree, which is the most important product of the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. The olive-tree can last for 2,000 years or so, so much so that some trees in Palestine are said to be existing since the time of Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him).
  - It has been attributed to Mount Sinai probably for the reason that the area whose well known and prominent place is Mount Sinai is its original habitat.
 
## Ayat 21

- `And indeed there is also a lesson for you in cattle.`
- `We provide you with drink out of what they have in their bellies;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, milk. Refer to( Surah An-Nahl, Ayat 66 and E.N. 54) thereof.
- `and you have many other benefits in them: you eat of them,`

## Ayat 22

- `and are carried on them and also on ships.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The benefits of cattle as means of conveyance have been mentioned here along with the ships, because in Arabia, camel was used mainly for this purpose, and has been called the ship of the desert for the same reason.
