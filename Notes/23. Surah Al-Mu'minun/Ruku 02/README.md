**Ayat  23 - 32**

## Ayat 23

- `We sent Noah to his people,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - See also(Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 59-64); (Surah Yunus, Ayats 71-73); (Surah Houd, Ayats 25-48);(Surah Bani Israil, Ayat 3 )and (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 76-77).
- `and he said:`
  - **`"My people! Serve Allah; you have no deity other than He. Do you have no fear?"`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, are you not afraid that if you set up partners and associates with Allah, Who is the real Sovereign, and worship and submit to them, you shall incur His wrath and punishment?

## Ayat 24

- `But the notables among his people had refused to believe, and said:`
  - `"This is none other than a mortal like yourselves`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - There has been a common deviation that a human being cannot be a Prophet, and a Prophet cannot be a human being.
    - That is why the Quran has refuted this wrong conception over and over again, and has stated forcefully that all the Prophets were human beings and that a human being only could be sent as a Prophet to human beings.
    - For details, see(Suras Al-Aaraf Ayats 63, 69); (Yuonus, Ayat 2); (Houd, Ayats 27-31); (Yousuf, Ayat 109); (Ar- Raad, Ayat 38); (Ibrahim, Ayats 10-11); (An-Nahl, Ayat 43),(Bani Israil, Ayats 94-95);(Al-Kahf, Ayat 110); (Al-Anbiya, Ayats 3, 34); (Al-Mominoon, Ayats 33-34, 47); (Al-Furqan, Ayats 7, 20);(Ash-Shuara, Ayats 154, 186); (Ya-Sin, Ayat 15), (Ha Mim Sajdah, Ayat 6)along with the relevant E.Ns.
  - `who desires to attain superiority over you.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This accusation is another old objection, which has always been raised against those who tried to reform their people. Their opponents always accused them of exploiting religion to gain domination in the land.
    - Prophets Moses, Aaron and Jesus were accused of the same and so was Muhammad (peace be upon them all). So much so that the disbelievers of Makkah offered to make the Prophet (peace be upon him) their king, if he gave up his message.
  - `Had Allah wanted (to send any Messengers) He would have sent down angels.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - As a matter of fact, the people who exhaust themselves in pursuit of worldly benefits and gains cannot believe that somebody in this world could also exert himself sincerely and selflessly for the sake of human welfare.
    - They regard deceptive slogans, which they raise to capture power, and false promises, which they make day and night to bring about reforms as natural. They think that sincerity and selflessness can be employed only to deceive people and these cannot be put to any better use.
    - That is why the epithet of power hungry for the reformers in all ages has been used by those already in power as if their own power and domination in the land was their birth right, and they were in no way blame worthy for struggling for it and achieving it. (For further explanation, see (E.N. 36 )below)
  - `We have heard nothing like this in the time of our forebears of old (that humans were sent as Messengers).`

## Ayat 25

- `He is a person who has been seized with a little madness;`
- `so wait for a while (perhaps he will improve)."`

## Ayat 26

- `Noah said:`
  - `"My Lord! Come to my help at their accusation that I am lying."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - **“Help me because they have denied me”**:
  - Take Thy vengeance on these people for they have denied me.
  - (Verse 10 of Surah Al-Qamar) says: Then cried Noah to his Lord, I am overcome, so take Thy vengeance on these people,
  - and (verses 26-27 of Noah) say: And Noah said, O my Lord, do not leave of these disbelievers any dweller upon the earth, for if Thou sparest them, they will mislead Thy servants and will beget none but sinners and disbelievers.

## Ayat 27

- `Thereupon We revealed to him, saying:`
  - `"Build the Ark under Our eyes and according to Our revelation.`
  - `And when Our command comes to pass`
  - `and the oven boils over,`
  - `take on board a pair each from every species,`
  - `and also take your household except those of them against whom sentence has already been passed`
  - `and do not plead to Me on behalf of the wrong-doers.`
  - `They are doomed to be drowned.` 

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Some commentators think that tannur means the earth; others take it for the highest part of the earth; and still others think that the words far-at-tannur in the text have been used for the break of dawn. There are some who express the opinion that the words have been used metaphorically for the creation of turmoil.
  - But in view of the context, we see no reason why one should take a far fetched figurative meaning of a clear word of the Quran. It appears that a particular oven (tannur) had been earmarked for the deluge to start from, which was to all appearances an unexpected origin of the doom of the wretched people.

## Ayat 28

- `And then when you and those accompanying you are firmly seated in the Ark,`
- `say:`
  - `"Thanks be to Allah Who has delivered us from the wrong-doing people."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The fact that Allah should be praised and thanked for the annihilation of those people, is a clear proof that they were the most wicked and villainous people in the world.


## Ayat 29

- `And say:`
  - `"My Lord! Make my landing a blessed landing, for You are the Best of those Who can cause people to land in safety."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Landing” here does not simply mean touching and resting on the land, but it also implies the sense of hospitality, as if to say:
    - **O God, now we are Thy guests and Thou alone art our Host.**

## Ayat 30

- `There are great Signs in this story;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - At the conclusion of the story of Prophet Noah (peace be upon him), particular attention has been drawn to the many signs in the story from which one can learn many lessons. 
    - For instance, the Prophet who invited the people to Tauhid was in the right and those who practiced and insisted on shirk and disbelief were in the wrong and were destroyed.
    - That the same kind of conflict, which took place between Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) and his people, was going on in Makkah. 
    - Therefore, ultimately the Prophet (peace be upon him) will come out victorious over his antagonists just like Prophet Noah (peace be upon him).
- `and surely We do put people to test.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This can also be translated as: We had to or have to put people to the test.
    - In each case the purpose is to warn the people that they will not be left alone after they have been granted power in the land and over good things of life, but Allah will put them to the test to see how they used their power.
    - Whatever happened with the people of Noah was in accordance with this law, and the same will happen in future with any community which is raised to power.

## Ayat 31

- `Then, after them, We brought forth another generation;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The people of Aad, who were raised to power after the people of Noah.
    - Refer to (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 69). 3

## Ayat 32

- `and We sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, saying:`
  - `"Serve Allah; you have no god other than He. Do you have no fear?"`
