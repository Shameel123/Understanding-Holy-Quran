**Ayat  33 - 50**


## Ayat 33

- `The notables among his people who had refused to believe and who denied the meeting of the Hereafter, and those whom We had endowed with ease and comfort in this life,1 cried out:`
  - `"This is no other than a mortal like yourselves who eats what you eat and drinks what you drink.`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It should be noted that all those people who opposed the Messengers had three common characteristics:
    1. They were the chiefs of their people.
    2. They denied life in the Hereafter.
    3. They were prosperous in the worldly life.
   -  Obviously, they loved the life of this world and could never conceive that their way of life, which had made them chiefs and brought prosperity, could ever be wrong.
   -  Therefore they opposed their Messengers, who took away their peace of mind, by preaching that there was a life-after-death and they shall have to render an account to Allah of what they did in this world. And this was exactly what was happening at Makkah.

## Ayat 34

- `If you were to obey a human being like yourselves,`
- `you will certainly be losers.`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Some commentators have wrongly opined that the chiefs exchanged these remarks against the Messenger between themselves.
  - These remarks in fact were addressed to the common people.
  - When the chiefs felt that the message was spreading among the common people and there was a real danger that they would be influenced by the pure character of the Messenger and that their superiority then would automatically come to an end, they began to delude them by raising such objections against him.
  - It is worth while to note that both the chiefs of the people of Noah and the chiefs of the people of Aad accused their Messengers of the lust for power but as regards to themselves, they thought that power and prosperity were their inherent rights and they were in every respect entitled to be the chiefs of their people. 

## Ayat 35

- `Does he promise you that when you are dead and are reduced to dust and bones, you will be brought forth to life?`

## Ayat 36

- `Far-fetched, utterly far-fetched is what you are being promised.`

## Ayat 37

- `There is no other life than the life of the world.`
- `We shall live here and here shall we die;`
- `and we are not going to be raised again.`

## Ayat 38

- `This man has forged a mere lie in the name of Allah`
- `and we shall never believe what he says."`

## Ayat 39

- `The Messenger said:`
  - **`"My Lord! Come to my help at their accusing me of lying."`**

## Ayat 40

- `He answered:`
  - **`"A short while, and they shall be repenting."`**

## Ayat 41

- `Then a mighty blast quite justly overtook them,`
- `and We reduced them to a rubble.`
- `So away with the wrong-doing folk!`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Lexically, the word ghutha means the rubbish which is brought by flood waters and is deposited on the banks to rot there.

## Ayat 42

- `Then, after them, We brought forth other generations.`

## Ayat 43

- `No nation can outstrip its term, nor can it put it back.`

## Ayat 44

- `Then We sent Our Messengers in succession.`
- `Whenever a Messenger came to his people they rejected him, calling him a liar.`
- `Thereupon, We made each people to follow the other (to its doom), reducing them to mere tales (of the past).`
- `Scourged be the people who do not believe!`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, those who do not believe in the Messengers.


## Ayat 45

- `Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our Signs and a clear authority`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The use of a manifest Authority along with Our signs may either mean that the signs were a clear proof that they were Messengers of Allah, or the signs may refer to all other miracles of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) than the staff, which may stand here for a clear authority, because the miracles shown by means of it were a clear proof that the two brothers had been sent by Allah.


## Ayat 46

- `to Pharaoh and to his chiefs,`
- `but they behaved superciliously and they were haughty.`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The words in the text may either mean:
    1. They were highly arrogant and tyrannous people.
    2. They showed haughtiness and self conceit.

## Ayat 47

- `They said:`
  - `"Shall we put faith in two mortals like ourselves`
  - `when their people are slaves to us?"`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - a For explanation, see(E.N. 26). 

## Ayat 48

- `So they rejected them, calling them liars, and they too eventually became of those that were destroyed.`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For further details of the story of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) and Pharaoh,
    - see(Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayats 49-50); (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 103-136); (Surah Younus, Ayats 75-92), (Surah H0ud, Ayats 96-99), (Surah Bani Israil, Ayats 101-104),(Surah TaHa, Ayats 9-80 )along with the relevant E. Ns.
 

## Ayat 49

- `And We gave Moses the Book that people might be guided by it.` 

## Ayat 50

- `And We made Mary's son, and his mother, a Sign,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The wording “We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign” is very significant, because it means that neither the son of Mary nor his mother was each a separate sign, but both of them together were a sign.
    - This verse is a clear proof that a son was born to Mary without cohabitation with a man and that Jesus had no father.
    - For further details see
      - (Surah Aal-Imran, Ayats 45-49); (Surah An-Nisa, Ayats 156, 171);(Surah Maryam, Ayats 16-35) and (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 91) and the relevant E.N.s.
- `and We gave them refuge on a lofty ground,`
- `a peaceful site with springs flowing in it.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this connection, it should also be noted that the case of the error in regards to Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) and his mother was different from the error in regard to other Prophets, who were rejected because they were human beings.
    - But the deviation in regard to Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) and his mother was that the credulous people raised them from the low position of human beings to the high rank of Godhead.
    - On the other hand, those, who went to the other extreme accused Mary of unchastity, although they were witnesses of the miraculous birth of Jesus and had heard him speak in the cradle.
