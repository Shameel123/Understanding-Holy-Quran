**Ayat  78 - 92**


## Ayat 78

- `It is He Who has endowed you with the faculties of hearing and sight and has given you hearts (to think).`
- `Scarcely do you give thanks.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The disbelievers have been told to consider the great blessings of eyes, ears, mind and heart and use them as human beings should, and show gratitude to the Creator by accepting His Message.

## Ayat 79

- `It is He Who has dispersed you all around the earth,`
- `and it is unto Him that you shall all be mustered.`

## Ayat 80

- `It is He Who gives life and causes death,`
- `and He holds mastery over the alternation of night and day.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - If one makes the right use of his faculties and observes these things properly, he can find the truth, for it is obvious that the great mechanism of the universe could not have come into existence by a mere accident.
    - There must be its Creator who need not have any associates or partners and that the universe could not have been created without a purpose as a mere sport.
    - The very existence of a wonderful, rational thinking and feeling creature, man, who has been delegated with powers, is a clear proof that his real life will not come to an end at death.
- `Do you not understand this?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here attention is being drawn to the proof of both Tauhid and life after death, and in the other phenomena cited to the refutation of both shirk and rejection of the Hereafter.

## Ayat 81

- `Nay, but they say the like of what their predecessors of yore had said.`

## Ayat 82

- `They say:`
  - `"Is it that when we are dead and have been reduced to dust and bones, shall we then be raised up again?`

## Ayat 83

- `We were promised such things and so were our forefathers before us.`
- `All these are no more than tales of the past."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Their denial of the life after death implied the denial of the powers and wisdom of Allah as well.

## Ayat 84

- `Ask them:`
  - `"Whose is the earth and those who are in it?`
  - `Tell us if you know"`

## Ayat 85

- `They will surely say:`
  - **`"Allah's."`**
- `Say:`
  - `"Then why do you not take heed?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, if you acknowledge this, why do you not then understand that none but Allah deserves to be worshiped and that when He has once created the earth and all the things in it, it is not difficult for Him to re-create them once again?

## Ayat 86

- `Ask them:`
  - `"Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, the Lord of the Great Throne?"`

## Ayat 87

- `They will surely say:`
  - **`"Allah."`**
- `Say:`
  - `"Will you not, then, fear (Allah)?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, why are you not afraid of rebelling against Him and worshiping others besides Him? Why do you not dread that one day you shall have to give an account of all your deeds to the All-Powerful Sovereign of the universe?

## Ayat 88

- `Ask them:`
  - `"Say, if you indeed know, to whom belongs the dominion over all things;`
  - `(Who is it) that grants asylum,`
  - `but against Whom no asylum is available?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The word malakut in the text is a strong word which combines both sovereignty and ownership.
  - The verse therefore means: Whose is the Sovereignty and Who possesses the real ownership rights over everything?

## Ayat 89

- `They will surely say:`
  - **`"(The dominion over all things) belongs to Allah."`**
- `Say:`
  - `"Whence are you then deluded?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In order to understand the significance of this question, we should know that the art of magic makes a thing appear different from what it really is.
  - Thus the question will mean:
    - Who has bewitched you that, in spite of knowing and acknowledging all these things, you do not understand the reality?
    - Who has bewitched you that even after acknowledging Allah to be the Owner and the All-Powerful Sovereign, you set up other owners and sovereigns along with Him or make them partners with Him and worship them?
    - Who has deluded you that you should dare to be treacherous and unfaithful to Allah knowing that none can protect you against Him, and forget that you will be called to account for these things?

## Ayat 90

- `We have brought before them the Truth,`
- `and there is no doubt that they are lying.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - They are liars because they say that others besides Allah have a share in His Godhead and that there is no life after death,
  - because their first saying contradicts their own admission that Allah is the Owner and the Sovereign of the universe.
  - Then their second assertion is based on the presumption that the All-Powerful Allah cannot recreate what He has created once.
  - This is clearly a contradiction in terms.


## Ayat 91

- `Never did Allah take unto Himself any son,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It should be, noted that this is a general refutation of the belief that Allah has a child or children, and incidentally refutes the Christian belief that Christ is the son of God.
    - Yet even some eminent commentators confine this to the refutation of the Christian belief. Obviously, there is no reason why it was necessary to refute the Christian belief specifically in this context, when the whole discourse has been directed towards the disbelievers of Makkah alone, who were, like the Christians, guilty of this sort of shirk.
- `nor is there any god other than He.`
- `(Had there been any other gods) each god would have taken his creatures away with him,`
- `and each would have rushed to overpower the other.2`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here the argument of Tauhid is based on this principle: Had there been more than one God or partners in Godhead, there would have been serious differences, conflicts and wars among the different sovereigns and rulers.
      - See (Surah Bani Israil, Ayat 42 and E.N. 47) thereof, and (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayat 22 and E. N. 22 )thereof.
- **`Glory be to Allah from all that they characterize Him with!`**
- `سُبْحَـٰنَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ `


## Ayat 92

- **`He knows both what is visible and what is not visible.`**
- **`Exalted is Allah above all that they associate with Him.`**

- `عَـٰلِمِ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَـٰدَةِ فَتَعَـٰلَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ`
