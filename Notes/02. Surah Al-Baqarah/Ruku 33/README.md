**Ayat 249 - 253**
# Ruku 33

## Juzz 3 Begins at the last Ayah of this Ruku

**Chronogical Order So Far That I have Been Able To Compile In Relation With Hazrat Moses AS and Bani Israel:**
- Hazrat Moosa (Moses) and Hazrat Haroon AS (Aaron)
- Hazrat Samuel (Shammil) AS (name not mentioned in previous Ruku)
- Hazrat Talut (Saul) AS
- Hazrat Dawood (David) AS
- Hazrat Suleiman (Solomon) AS
Ayat 249:
- `When Saul (Talut) set out with his forces he said:`
- `“Allah will try you with a river, and whoever drinks of it does not belong to me; he who refrains from tasting it – unless it be just a palmful – he indeed belongs to me.”`
- `Then all, except a few of them, drank their fill at the river.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This may refer either to the river Jordan or to some other river or stream in that region. Saul wanted to take the Israelite army across the river. He was aware, however, that there was little moral discipline and restraint left in them. Hence he hit upon this device to distinguish the worthy from the worthyless. Those who could not endure thirst even for a short while, would not be expected to remain steadfast in their confrontation with an enemy at whose hands they had already taken a beating.
- `But as soon as Saul (Talut) and the believers with him went forth across the river, they said:`
- `“Today we have no strength to face Goliath (Jalut) and his forces.”`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - These were presumable the people who had shown their impatience on the bank of the river. (See the preceding note - Ed.)
- `But those who believed that they were bound to meet their Lord said:`
- **`“How often has a small party prevailed against a large party by the leave of Allah.”`**
- `Allah is with those who remain steadfast.`



Ayat 250:
- `And when they went forth against Goliath (Jalut) and his forces, they prayed:` 
- **`“Our Lord! Shower us with patience, and set our feet firm, and grant us victory over this unbelieving people.”`**


Ayat 251:
- `Thereupon by Allah’s leave they put the unbelievers to flight, and`
- `David killed Goliath,`
  -  Tahfim-ul-Quran:
     -  David was then in the early years of his youth. 
     -  By chance he joined the army of Saul just when the mighty champion of the Philistine army had challenged the Israelite army to combat.
     -  None of the Israelites had the courage to take up the challenge. 
     -  On seeing this, David took on Goliath in a duel and slew him. 
     -  From then on, David could do no wrong in the eyes of the Israelites. 
     -  Saul gave him the hand of his daughter in marriage and ultimately he became the ruler of the Israelites. (For details see 1 Samuel, chapters 17 and I8.)
- `and Allah granted him dominion and wisdom, and imparted to him the knowledge of whatever He willed.`
- `And were it not that Allah repelled some people with another, the earth would surely be overlaid with mischief.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This enunciates the principle according to which God treats the nations as a part of the Divine system governing the world.
    - He allows various nations to attain power and strength within certain limits.
    - But when any nation begins to commit wrongs and exceed reasonable limits.
    - God brings forth another nation as a counterweight, 
    - Were the dominion of one nation or party to endure for ever, and were its capacity to perpetrate wrongs granted in perpetuity, 
    - God's earth would become full of corruption and wickedness.
- `But Allah is Bounteous to the people of the world (and thus extirpates mischief).`


Ayat 252:
- **`These are the Signs of Allah which We recite to you in Truth, for indeed you are one of those entrusted with the Message.`**

**Juz 3 Begins!**
Ayat 253:
- `And these Messengers (who have been designated to guide people),`
- `We have exalted some of them above the others.`
- `Among them are such as were spoken to by Allah Himself,`
- `and some He exalted in other respects.`
  - I think, here it is mentioned that every Prophet has His own respect.
- `And We granted Jesus, son of Mary, Clear Signs and supported him with the spirit of holiness.`
- `Had He willed, those who had seen these Clear Signs would not have fought one another thereafter.`
- `But (it was not the will of Allah to prevent people from disagreement by compulsion, hence) they differed among themselves whereby some attained faith and others denied the Truth.`
- `Yet had Allah so willed they would not have fought one another. Allah does whatever He wills.`
