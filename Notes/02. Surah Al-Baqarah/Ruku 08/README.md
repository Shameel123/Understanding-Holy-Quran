**Ayat 62 - 71**
# Ruku 8

## Overview
Topic of Israelites is on-going in this Ruku.\

## General Summary in my own words:
- Ayat 62 mentions about the criteria of reward which is for Muslims, Christians, Jews, Sabians
- Ayat 63 mentions about the incident of holding Mount Sinai over the heads of Israelites.
- Ayat 64 mentions the mercy of Allah SWT
- Ayat 65 mentions the incident of Israelites being converted to Apes
- Ayat 66 mentions that afermentioned incident is warning for us.
- Ayat 67-71 is the "second-half" of the story which is completed in next Ruku.
  - Note: The story is not narrated in chronological order in order to emphasize two misdeeds equally (as per the explanation of Maarif-ul-Quran)
## Explanation of Ruku:

Mount Sinai = Koh-e-Toor =  کوہ طور

Ayat 62:
- The Ayah mentions following nations:
  - Those who believe (Muslims)
  - Jews
  - Christians
  - Sabians (It's a mystery about who this nation is)
- Afermentioned nations/people will be rewarded if:
  - They believe in Allah.
  - They believe in Hereafter.
- Question: Does this mean that Jews, Christians and Sabians will also be allowed to go to Jannah if they:
    - Believe in Allah SWT.
    - Believe in Last Day.
    - Do righteous deeds.
- Answer:
     - It is given in Maarif-ul-Quran as quoted below:
     - The verse mentions only two articles of faith of the Islamic creed -- faith in Allah and faith in the Day of Judgment. This should not be taken to mean that in order to attain salvation it is enough to have faith only in Allah and in the Day of Judgment. For, the Holy Qur'an repeatedly declares that he who does not believe in the prophets, in angels and in the Books of Allah is not a Muslim. Faith in Allah is the first article in the Islamic creed, while faith in the Day of Judgment is the last. By mentioning only these two, the verse intends to say in a succinct manner that it is necessary to have faith in all the articles of the creed, from the first to the last. Moreover, it is through the prophets and the Books of Allah alone that man can acquire any knowledge of the essence and the attributes of Allah and of what is to happen on the Day of Judgment, while the Books of Allah are revealed to the prophets through an angel. So, it is not possible to have faith in Allah and the Day of Judgment until and unless one has faith in the angels, in the Books of Allah and in the prophets.
   - Note: I have now noticed that Holy Quran mentions "أَجْرُهُمْ" which means "reward", this does not necessarliy mean "Jannah". This could mean that they are going to get 'wordly' reward or maybe their punishment gets decreased in the form of reward or maybe they are saved from Jahannum as a reward but cannot go in Jannat either. These are all my own assumptions and understanding from the Ayah. 


Ayat 63:
- Mount Sinai was raised over them and it was said to them, “Hold fast to the Book that We have given you, and remember the directives and commandments in it, that you be pious.”
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It is unclear about the nature of the incident but it is believed that Israelites knew about this incident. 
- Tafsir Ibn Kathir:
  - In the Hadith about the trials, Ibn `Abbas said; "When they (the Jews) refused to obey, Allah raised the mountain above their heads so that they would listen." 
- Maarif-ul-Quran:
  - Having received the Torah from Allah, Sayyidna Musa (Moses علیہ السلام) returned from Mount Tur طور (Sinai) and recited it to the Israelites.
  - Having received the Torah from Allah, Sayyidna Musa (Moses علیہ السلام) returned from Mount Tur طور (Sinai) and recited it to the Israelites.
  - Having received the Torah from Allah, Sayyidna Musa (Moses علیہ السلام) returned from Mount Tur طور (Sinai) and recited it to the Israelites.
  - Seventy men, as we have related above, were selected to go to Mount Tur and to hear Allah attest the authenticity of the Torah. 
  - On their re-turn, they bore witness to the Torah being a Book of Allah, but added something on their own to what Allah had actually said.
    - For, they told the Israelites that Allah had allowed them to act upon the injunctions only as much as they could, and had promised to forgive them for what they could not accomplish.
    - They had always and instinctively been prone to rebellion against Allah, then, the injunctions were, no doubt, stern, and now they got a new pretext for being negligent. 
    - So, the Israelites flatly refused to obey the injunctions, insisting that it was beyond their endurance to act upon such harsh regulations.
  - In reply to this insolence, Allah commanded the angels to raise Mount Tur and let it hang in the air above their heads as a threat that:
    - If they did not fulfill their covenant with Allah, it would fall on them and crush them. The Israelites, then, had no choice but to submit.


Ayat 64:
- They turned away from covenant.
- It was Allah's Grace فَضْلُ and Mercyوَرَحْمَتُهُ ۥ otherwise they would have been from the Losers!


Ayat 65:
- Saturday = Sabbath = ٱلسَّبْتِ= Sacred Day
- Allah mentions the case when they broke the matter of Saturday.
  - It is the case when Israelites were commanded to rest and worship.
    - My thoughts: Does it relate to us (Muslims) in a manner that we should not be working from First Azan of Jumma? 
  - They transgessed and Allah made them Apes.
- Maarif-ul-Quran:
  - This episode belongs to the time of Sayyidna Dawud (David) علیہ السلام
  - Fishing was prohibited on this day.
  - Al-Qurtubi says that the Israelites, at first, invented all sorts of clever pretences for catching fish on Saturday, and gradually started doing so openly.
  - One of the trick is: they would tie one end of a cord to the tail of a fish and the other end to something on the shore, and leave the fish in the water; on Sunday, they would take it out and eat it. Such a ruse not only negates an injunction of the Shari'ah, but is actually a mockery.
    - I think it directly links with what people do these days... quite often.
  - Qatadah says that the young ones had become apes, and the old ones swine. The apes could recognize their relatives and friends, and would approach them weeping out of remorse, and seeking their sympathy and help. Then all of them died after three days.
  - Some people believe/argue that their clan continued but this is not the case. When Allah gives a punishement to a nation, they cease to exist.
    - According to a hadith reported by Imam Muslim from the blessed Companion ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ some people asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ whether the apes and the swine were the descendants of the metamorphosed Jews. The Holy Prophet reminded them that apes and swine existed in the world even before, and said that when Allah sends down this particular kind of punishment on a people, the race comes to an end with this, and there is no further breeding.
   
  Ayat 66:
  - This incident was made as a warning for the people of that and for us right now so that we learn from this.


### The incident in the following Ayah is related to the slaughering of the cow.
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Old Testament also mentions the incident, but there is no reference to the manner in which the Jews tried to evade the matter. (See Numbers 19: 1-10.)
    - Through contact with neighbouring peoples, the Israelites had become infested with the attitude of sanctifying the cow, in fact they had even become accustomed to cow-worship.
    -  In order to disabuse the Jews of this, they were ordered to slaughter the cow. Their professed belief that God alone was worthy of worship could be tested only by making them slaughter with their own hands what they had formerly worshipped. 
    -  This test was indeed a hard one since their hearts were not fully imbued with faith. 
    -  Hence, they tried to shelve the issue by resorting to enquiries about the kind of animal they were required to slaughter. 
    -  But the more they enquired, the narrower the strait became for them, until the indications were as obvious as if someone had put his finger precisely on the particular animal they were required to slaughter - the animal which had for so long been an object of their worship. 
- Maarif-ul-Quran:
  - According to Mirqat, a commentary on Mishkat, a man among the Israelites wanted to marry a girl, but her father refused. 
  - The suitor was so incensed that he killed the father, and disappeared. 
  - It is mentioned in Ma` alim al-tanzil which says on the authority of Kalbi that Allah had not yet sent down any injunction with regard to man-slaughter. 
  - If it was so, this shows that the incident happened before the Torah was revealed.
  -  Anyhow, the Israelites requested Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) to tell them how to trace the culprit. 
  -  Under the commandment of Allah, he asked them to sacrifice a cow. 
  -  As was their regular habit, they started raising all kinds of doubts and objections, of which the next verses give us the details.
  

Ayat 67:
- Hazrat Musa AS told them that Allah has commanded them to slaughter a cow.
- At first, Israelites did not believe and questioned Hazrat Musa AS.
- Hazrat Musa answered: “I seek refuge in Allah that I should behave in the manner of the ignorant.”


Ayat 68:
- They said: “Pray to your Lord that He make clear to us what she is like.”
-  Moses answered: “He says, she is a cow, neither old nor immature, but of an age in between the two. Do, then, what you have been commanded.”


Ayat 69:
- They said: “Pray to your Lord that He make clear to us of what colour she is.”
- Moses answered: “He says, she is a yellow cow, with a bright colour which is pleasing to those who see!”

Ayat 70:
- They said: “Pray to your Lord that He make clear to us what cow she is. Cows seem much alike to us, and if Allah wills, we shall be guided.”

Ayat 71:
- Moses answered: “Lo! He says, she is a cow unyoked to plough the earth or to water the tillage, one that has been kept secure, with no blemish on her!” Thereupon they cried out: “Now you have come forth with the information that will direct us aright.”
- They were now compelete sure of who the cow was.
- Quran shareef mentions that they did not want to sacrifice the cow.
