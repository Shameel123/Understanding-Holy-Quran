## Overview

Ayat 113
- `The Jews say: “The Christians have no basis for their beliefs,” and `
- `the Christians say: “The Jews have no basis for their beliefs.” `
- `They say so even though they read the Scripture. `
- `The claim of those who have no knowledge (of the Scripture) is similar.`
- `Allah will judge between them concerning their differences on the Day of Resurrection.`

- Here is is told that the people who read the Scripture Jews and Christians balmes one another that they do not have any basis for their respective beliefs, however, their calim is similar with the ones who do not believe in any scripture, i.e., polythiests.
- Allah will judge all of them accordingly when we all we be resurrected!

Ayat 114:

- `Who is more iniquitous than he who bars Allah’s places of worship, `
- `that His name be mentioned there, and seeks their destruction? `
- `It does not behove such people to enter them, `
- `and should they enter, they should enter in fear.` 
- `There is degradation for them in this world and a mighty chastisement in the Next.`

Maarif-ul-Quran:
 It is forbidden to prevent people, in any form or manner possible, from offering their prayers or "remembering" Allah in a mosque

 Note: I can not link it to current era as of how people are behaving this way currently?


 Ayat 115:
 - `The East and the West belong to Allah. `
 - `To whichever direction you turn, you will be turning to Allah.`
   - Taarif-ul-Quran:
     - God is neither eastern nor western. East and west, north and south, and indeed all places and directions are His, though He is not confined to any particular place or direction. Hence, if any place or direction is fixed for worship this does not mean that God dwells there. Likewise, changes in the direction of Prayer is not a proper subject for controversy and dispute.
 - `Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.`



Ayat 116:
- `They say: “Allah has taken to Himself a son.” `
  - Maarif-ul-Quran:
    1. As the Holy Qur'an reports in some other verses, some of the Jews called the Prophet Uzayr (علیہ السلام) (Ezra) the son of God, 
    2. as did the Christians in the case of Sayyidna ` Isa (Jesus علیہ السلام)~ and most of them still do, 
    3. while the mushrikin مشرکین of Makkah considered the angels to be the daughters of God. These two verses show the absurdity of such assertions.
- `Glory to Him!` 
- `Nay, whatever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him; `
- `to Him are all in obeisance.`


Ayat 117:
- `He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth;` 
- `whenever He decrees a matter He (merely) says: “Be”, and it is.`
  - `لَهُۥ كُن فَيَكُونُ`
  

Ayat 118:
- `The ignorant say: `
  - `“Why does Allah not speak to us?`
    - Taarif-ul-Quran:
      - What they meant was that God should either appear before them Himself, tell them plainly that the Qur'an was a revelation from Him, and proclaim His injunctions, or cause them to see some extraordinary sign that would convince them that whatever Muhammad (peace be on him) told them was from Him.
  - `Why does no Sign come to us?” `
- `The same was said by people before them. `
- `Their hearts are all alike.`
- `We have made the Signs clear for people of firm faith.`
  - Taarif-ul-Quran:
    - The demand that God should speak to them directly was too absurd even to be answered. The question dealt with here concerns the demand for a sign that would convince them of the Truth. In response to this it is pointed out that many signs do exist, but all such signs are of profit only to those who are inclined to believe. As for those who are bent on disbelief, what sign can be shown to them, and to what avail?

Those who say these 2 things relate exactly to the people who came before them. Allah mentions that their hearts are all alike and the signs are available for the ones who believe and ponder!

Ayat 119:
- `What greater Sign can there be than that)`
- ` We sent you with the Truth as a bearer of good tidings and a warner! `
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Why speak of other signs when the most conspicuous sign of Truth is the very person of Muhammad? (PBUH) 
    - Let us recall his life before the commencement of his prophethood, the conditions existing in the area where, and the people among whom, he was born, the manner in which he was brought up and spent the first forty years of his life, and then his glorious achievements as a Prophet. 
    - What further signs could we want in support of his message?
- `And you will not be answerable about the people of the Blazing Flame!`
  - I do not get this hint either...


Ayat 120:
- `Never will the Jews be pleased with you, (O Prophet), nor the Christians until you follow their way.1 `
- `Say: “Surely Allah’s guidance, is the true guidance.” `
- `Should you follow their desires disregarding the knowledge which has come to you, `
- `you shall have no protector or helper against Allah`


I believe the Ayah mentions us in a way that whatever we do, we won't be able to make the ones against the Deen happy no matter how honest and good we become. Then it mentiones the guidance of Allah SWT to affirm us, even though we are not flourishing right now, the true Guidance is of Allah! and "if" in order to make them happy, we divert our way from Deen, we won't have any protector!
This EASILY fits the current era we live in. In order to make 'society' and cultural fanatics, we divert ourselves from the Deen to answer a question "what people will say?" and this Ayah is the PERFECT answer to that question which arises in our heart to drift away from the way of Deen!


Ayat 121:
- `Those to whom We have given the Scripture, `
- `and who recite it as it ought to be recited, `
- `they truly believe in it;`
  -  `حَقَّ تِلَاوَتِهِۦٓ`
  - As it should be recited.... This Ayah is the proof that we MUST recite Holy Quran like we cram and understand the concepts of technical books for 3 hour exams. No, we MUST recite and UNDERSTAND it much BETTER THAN those exams! That is the true 'Haq' of Holy Quran as it is the MOST VALUABLE Book than any other book that we have read to pass any of the worldly exam! This Book is the ONLY Book which will help us pass the Real Exam!
- `and those who disbelieve in it, they are the real losers.`
  - Does this mean, those who do not study it properly are the real losers? or does this mean who study it but do not believe in it (as per their actions) are the true losers?
