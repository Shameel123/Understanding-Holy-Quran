## Overview


Ayat 223:
- `When you divorce women and they have completed their waiting term do not hinder them from marrying other men if they have agreed to this in a fair manner.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is a directive to the relatives of the divorced woman. When a woman is divorced by her husband and he fails to revoke the divorce before the expiry of the waiting period, the relatives of the woman should not try to prevent the couple from re-marrying if they agree to do so. 
    - This verse may also be interpreted to mean that if a divorced woman wants to contract marriage with someone other than her former husband after the expiry of the waiting period, the former husband should not obstruct this marriage by making malicious propaganda against the woman he has forsaken. 
    - That is an admonition to every one of you who believes in Allah and the Last Day; 
    - that is a cleaner and purer way for you. For Allah knows whereas you do not know.
- ` That is an admonition to everyone of you who believes in Allah and the Last Day; that is a cleaner and purer way for you. For Allah knows whereas you do not know.`


Ayat 233:
- `If they (i.e. the fathers) wish that the period of suckling for their children be completed, mothers may suckle their children for two whole years.`
- `(In such a case) it is incumbent upon him who has begotten the child to provide them (i.e. divorced women) their sustenance and clothing in a fair manner.`
- `But none shall be burdened with more than he is able to bear;`
- ` neither shall a mother suffer because of her child nor shall the father be made to suffer because he has begotten him.`
- `The same duty towards the suckling mother rests upon the heir as upon him (i.e. the father).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, if the father dies, whoever replaces him as the guardian of the child will be responsible for fulfilling this claim.
- `And if both (the parents) decide, by mutual consent and consultation, to wean the child, there is no blame on them;`
- `if you decide to have other women suckle your children there is no blame upon you,` 
- `provided you hand over its compensation in a fair manner.`
- `Fear Allah and know well that Allah sees all that you do.`

Ayat 234:
- `The wives of men who have died must observe a waiting period of four months and ten days;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The waiting period owing to the death of the husband is obligatory even for a woman with whom consummation of marriage has not taken place.
    - A pregnant woman, however, is exempted from this. 
    - Her waiting period expires the husband's death and the childbirth is less than the waiting period prescribed by Law.
    - 'To observe a waiting period' does not mean merely that they should refrain from marrying, but also from self-adornment.
    - Hence we find categorical directives in the Hadith that a widow should neither wear colourful and showy dresses and jewellery, make use of henna, kohl, and perfumes, nor set her hair in an attractive style.
    - There is disagreement, however, as to whether the widow may go out of her house during the waiting period.
    -  'Umar, 'UthmaAn, Ibn 'Umar, Zayd ibn Thabit, Ibn Mas'uid, Ummn Salamah, Said ibn al-Musayyib, Ibrahim al-Nakha'i, Muhammad ibn Sirin and the founders of the four legal schools are of the opinion
       -  that during the waiting period a woman should stay in the house in which her husband died. 
       -  During the daytime she may go out to do necessary errands, but her residence should be her own home.
    -  On contrary, 'A'ishah, Ibn 'Abbas, 'Ali, Jabir ibn 'Abd Allah. 'Ata'. Ta'us, Hasan al-Basri. 'Umar ibn'Abd al'Aziz and the Zahiris are of the opinion
       -  that a widow may spend her waiting period wherever she likes, and may even go on journeys. (See the commentary on the verse in JassAs. vol. 1, pp. 418 f. - Ed.)
- `when they have reached the end of the waiting term, there is no blame upon you regarding what they may do with themselves in a fair manner. Allah is well aware of what you do.`


 Ayat 235:
 - `There is no blame upon you whether you hint at a marriage proposal to such women or keep the proposal hidden in your hearts.`
 - `Allah knows that you will think of them in that connection.`
 - `But do not make any secret engagement with them and speak openly in an honourable manner.`
 - `Do not resolve on the marriage tie until the ordained term has come to its end.`
 - `Know well that Allah knows even what is in your hearts.`
 - `So, have fear of Him and know well that Allah is All-Forgiving, All-Forbearing.`
