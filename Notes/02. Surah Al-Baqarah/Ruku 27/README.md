## Overview


Ayat 217:
- `People ask you about fighting in the holy month.` 
- `Say:` 
  - `“Fighting in it is an awesome sin,` 
  - `but barring people from the Way of Allah,` 
  - `disbelieving in Him,` 
  - `and denying entry into the Holy Mosque`
  - `and expelling its inmates from it`
  - `are more awesome acts in the sight of Allah;`
  - `and persecution is even more heinous than killing.”` 
- `They will not cease fighting against you till they turn you from your religion if they can.`
- `(So remember well) that whoever from amongst you turns away from his religion`
- `and dies in the state of unbelief`
- `their work will go to waste in this world and in the Next.`
- `They are destined for the Fire and it is there that they will abide.`

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- This relates to a certain incident. 
- In Rajab 2 A. H. the Prophet sent an expedition of eight persons to Nakhlah (which lies between Makka and Ta'if). 
- He directed them to follow the movements of the Quraysh and gather information about their plans, but not to engage in fighting. 
- On their way they came across a trade caravan belonging to the Quraysh and ambushed it. 
- They killed one person and captured the rest along with their belongings and took them to Madina. 
- They did this at a time when the month of Rajah was approaching its end and Sha'ban was about to begin. 
- It was, therefore, doubtful whether the attack was actually carried out in one of the sacred months, that is, Rajab, or not. 
- But the Quraysh, and the Jews who were secretly in league with them, as well as the hypocrites made great play of this and used it as a weapon in their propaganda campaign against the Muslims. 
- (For this expedition see Ibn Hisham, Sirah. vol. 1, pp. 601 ff; Ibn Ishaq, Life of Muhammad, tr. A. Guillaume. pp. 286 ff.) 
- They pointed out the contradiction between the claims of the Muslims to true religion on the one hand, and their not hesitating to shed blood in a sacred month on the other. 
- This verse aims to answer these objections. 
- The essence of what is said here is that fighting during the sacred months is without doubt an evil act. 
- It points out that those people who had continually subjected their kith and kin to untold wrong for thirteen years merely because they believed in the One God were not competent to make such an objection. 
- Not only had the Muslims been driven from their homes, they had had the way to the Holy Mosque closed to them, a bar which had not been imposed by anyone during the course of some two thousand years. 
- With this record of mischief and misconduct it was not for them to raise such an outcry at a minor ambush, and especially so when the incident had taken place without the approval of the Prophet. 
- The whole incident was in fact no more than an irresponsible act on the part of some members of the Islamic community.
- It should be remembered that when on their return those people went, with captives and booty, to visit the Prophet, 
  - He expressly pointed out to them that he had not permitted them to fight. 
  - Not only that, He declined to receive the public exchequer's share of their booty, which indicated that their booty was considered unlawful. 
- The Muslims, in general, also severely reproached the people responsible for the incident, and in fact nobody in Madina applauded what they had done.



Ayat 217:
- `(On the contrary) those who believed`
- `and forsook their hearth and home and strove`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Jihad denotes doing one's utmost to achieve something.
    -  It is not the equivalent of war, for which the Arabic word is qital. 
    -  Jihad has a wider connotation and embraces every kind of striving in God's cause. 
    -  A mujahid is a person who is single-mindedly devoted to his cause, 
       -  who uses his mental capacity to reflect how best he can achieve it, 
       -  propagates it by word of mouth and by the pen, 
       -  uses his physical energy in striving to serve it, 
       -  spends all the resources at his disposal to promote it, 
       -  employs all the force he commands in confronting any power which might stand in its way, 
       -  and, whenever necessary, 
       -  does not shirk risking his very life for it. 
    - All this is Jihad. 
    - 'Jihad in the way of God' is that strife in which man engages exclusively to win God's good pleasure, to establish the supremacy of His religion and to make His word prevail.
- `in the Way of Allah, such may rightly hope for the mercy of Allah: for Allah is All-Forgiving, All- Merciful.`


Ayat 219:
- `They ask you about wine and games of chance.` 
- `Say:` 
  - ` “In both these there is great evil,` 
  - `even though there is some benefit for people,` 
  - `but their evil is greater than their benefit.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This is the first injunction concerning intoxicating drinks and gambling, and here the matter has been left merely as an expression of disapproval. This was a preliminary step designed to prepare the minds of people for the acceptance of their prohibition. The injunction prohibiting the performance of Prayer when in a state of intoxication came later, and ultimately alcohol, gambling and the like were categorically prohibited see( 4: 43)and(5: 90).
- `They ask:` 
  - `“What should we spend in the Way of Allah?”` 
- `Say:` 
  - `“Whatever you can spare.”`
- `In this way Allah clearly expounds His injunctions to you that you may reflect upon them,`


Ayat 221:
- `Marry not the women who associate others with Allah in His Divinity until they believe;`
- `for a believing slave-girl is better than a (free, respectable) woman who associates others with Allah in His Divinity, even though she might please you.`
- `Likewise, do not give your women in marriage to men who associate others with Allah in His Divinity until they believe;`
- `for a believing slave is better than a (free, respectable) man who associates others with Allah in His Divinity, even though he might please you.` 
- `Such people call you towards the Fire,` 
- `and Allah calls you, by His leave, towards Paradise and forgiveness;` 
- `and He makes His injunctions clear to people so that they may take heed.`
