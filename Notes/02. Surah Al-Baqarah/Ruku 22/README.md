## Overview

Maarif-ul-Quran:
From the beginning to this point, the Sarah al-Baqarah is reaching its half-way mark. Until now, the message was addressed mostly to its deniers since the truth of the Holy Qur'an was the first thing to be established. In that context, mention was made of those who accepted it and those who rejected it, which was followed by providing proof of Allah's Oneness and the Prophethood. Then, recounted were Allah's blessings and favours on the progeny of Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) right through the verse وَإِذِ ابْتَلَىٰ إِبْرَ‌اهِيمَ رَ‌بُّهُ (2:124). Thenceforth started the issue of the Qiblah قبلہ which continued until it was resolved when the status of Safa صفاء and Marwah مروہ was identified as a sign from Allah (Verse 158).

Then, the affirmation of Allah's Oneness was rightfully followed by a refutation of the principles and subsidiaries of Shirk شرک ، the act of associating others with Allah. The approach this far is full of warning mostly given to the deniers of the message of the Qur'an; any reference to Muslims was only as a corollary.

The verses that follow contain nearly the other half of Sarah al-Baqarah where the primary purpose is to educate Muslims in the principles and the subsidiaries of their religion and any address to non-Muslims is by implication only. 

The chapters of 'Birr' بِرَّ‌ (the virtues)

From this point onwards, the reader will find details of this comprehensive attribute of birr بِرَّ‌, the essence of which is 'obedience'. Many injunctions, in unison with suitable time and place, have been taken up as needed. Some of these are about Equal Retaliation, Will, Fasting, Jihad, Hajj, Spending, Menstruation,’ Ila’ Oath, Divorce, Marriage, Post-divorce waiting period for women ('Iddah عِدَّہ ), Dower (Mahr مھر), while Jihad جہاد and Infaq انفاق (spending) in the way of Allah find re-stress, and some aspects of buying and selling and witnessing appear proportionate to their need. The finale is good tidings and the promise of mercy and forgiveness.

Ayat 177:
- `Righteousness does not consist in turning your faces towards the east or towards the west;`
-  Maarif-ul-Quran:
   -  When Baytullah بیت اللہ ، the House of Allah at Makkah was made the Qiblah قبلہ of the Muslims in place of Baytul-Maqdis بیت المقدس ، the Jews and Christians and the Mushrikin مشرکین ، who were much too eager to find fault with Islam and Muslims, were stirred and they started coming up with all sorts of objections against Islam and the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، detailed answers to which have been given in verses that have appeared earlier.

   - In the present verse, this debated issue has been closed in a unique manner when it was said that Faith cannot be restricted to the single aspect of turning to the West or the East when praying. These are directions in an absolute sense and thus cannot be turned into the very object of Faith to the total exclusion of other injunctions of the Shari'ah.

   - It is also possible that this is addressed to Jews, Christians and Muslims at the same time, the sense being that real birr (righteousness) and thawab ثواب (merit) lies in obedience to Allah Almighty. 
  
   - The direction in which He wants us to turn automatically becomes merit-worthy and correct. In itself, the East or the West, or any other direction or orientation has no importance or merit.

   - Instead, the real merit comes out of one's obedience to the injunctions of Allah, no matter what the direction be. Upto the time the command was to turn towards the Baytul-Maqdis بیت المقدس ، the obedience to that command was an act deserving of merit, and now, when the command to turn towards the House of Allah بیت اللہ at Makkah has come, obeying this command has become deserving of merit.

   - As stated earlier during the discussion of linkage of verses, a new sequence begins from this verse where the main body of the text comprises of teachings and instructions for Muslims with answers to antagonists appearing there by implication. 
   - This is why this particular verse has been identified as very comprehensive in presenting Islamic injunctions. 
   - What follows through the end of Surah al-Baqarah is an explanation or elaboration of this verse. 
   - Given below is a detailed account of what the verse presents as a gist of the articles of faith, the modes of Allah's worship, dealings with people, and the moral principles.

- `true righteousness consists in believing in`
  - `Allah`
  - `and the Last Day`
  - `the angels`
  - `the Book`
  - `and the Prophets`
  - `and in giving away one’s property in love of Him to one’s`
    - `kinsmen,`
    - `orphans,`
    - `the poor,`
    - `and the wayfarer,`
    - `and to those who ask for help,`
    - `and in freeing the necks of slaves,`
    - `and in establishing Prayer`
    - `and dispensing the Zakah.`
  - `True righteousness is attained by those`
    - `who are faithful to their promise once they have made it `
    - `and by those who remain steadfast in`
      - `adversity and`
      - `affliction and`
      - `at the time of battle (between Truth and falsehood).`
  - `Such are the truthful ones; such are the God-fearing.`



Ayat 178:
- `Believers! Retribution is prescribed for you in cases of killing:`
  - `if a freeman is guilty then the freeman;` 
  - `if a slave is guilty then the slave;` 
  - `if a female is guilty, then the female.`
- `But if something of a murderer’s guilt is remitted by his brother`
- `this should be adhered to in fairness,`
- `and payment be made in a goodly manner.` 
- `This is an alleviation and a mercy from your Lord;`
- `and for him who commits excess after that`
- `there is a painful chastisement.`

Please study the details of historical events from Tahfim-ul-Quran and Maarif-ul-Quran.
They have also mentioned how we should follow Qisaas in-case this event occurs in the society.
- The most important one mentioned is that the party whose person has been killed cannot kill the killer, rather the ruler of the Muslim Ummah will decide this.
- If one person from the victim's family (inheritor) decides to forgive the killer then the killer is forgiven and the blood money is distributed among all inheritors.
- In Shari'ah, this diyah amounts to 
  - one hundred camels or 
    - Couldn't calcualte, doesn't know the cost of 1 camel
  - one thousand dinars or 
    - 611470 PKR (Around 6 Lacs)
  - ten thousand dirhams درھم or approximately 
    - 508900 (Around 5 Lacs)
  - nineteen pounds of silver according to current weights and measures.
    - I calculated this silver amount:
    - 19 pounds = 1253955.084 PKR (around 12.5k Lacs)

Ayat 179:
- `People of understanding, there is life for you in retribution`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This refutes another notion of Ignorance, a notion ingrained in the minds of many people, both past and present. 
    - On the one hand there are some people who, entrenched in Ignorance, tend to exceed the limits of moderation in revenge. 
    - At the other end of the spectrum stand those who are opposed in principle to the concept of executing a murderer. 
    - They have conducted such intense, world-wide propaganda against the death penalty that it has become abhorrent to many people. 
    - In fact the impact of this propaganda has been so great that in many countries the death penalty has been abolished altogether. 
    - The Qur'an, however, addresses itself on this question to wise and intelligent people and cautions them against such immoderate leniency by proclaiming that the survival of human society rests on the application of the death penalty for homicide. 
    - A society which holds inviolable the lives of those who disregard the sanctity of human life is in fact rearing snakes and serpents. 
    - To save the life of one murderer is to risk the lives of many innocent human beings.

- `that you may guard yourselves against violating the Law.`


Ayat 180:
- `It is decreed that when death approaches,` 
- `those of you who leave behind property shall bequeath equitably` 
- `to parents and` 
- `kinsmen.`
- **`This is an obligation on the God-fearing.`**
- Before I used to believe that it was up to us how we share since there's a concept of "will".
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This injunction relates to a period of time when no rules had been laid down for the distribution of inheritance. 
  - Thus everyone was required to make testamentary disposal of their property so as to ensure that no disputes arose in the family and no legitimate claimant to inheritance was deprived of his due share. 
  - Later when God revealed a set of laws regarding the distribution of inheritance see (Qur'an 4: 11 ff.), 
  - the Prophet elucidated further the laws relating to testamentary disposition and inheritance by expounding two rules.
    1. First, that no person can make any will regarding his estate in favour of any of his legal heirs. 
       - Their portions were laid down in the Qur'an and neither increase nor decrease in this was permissible, nor could any heir be disinherited, nor anything willed in favour of any heir over and above his legal portion. (See the Tradition: 'There may be no will in favour of the heir.' See Abu Da'ud, 'Al-Wasaya', 6; Tirmidhi, 'Al-Wasaya', 5; Nasa'i, 'Al-Wasaya', 5; Ibn Majah, 'Al-Wasaya', 5 - Ed.) 
    2. Second, that testamentary disposition might be made to the extent of one third of the estate, but no more. (See Bukhari, 'Al-Wasaya', 2 and 3; Muslim, 'Al-Wasiyah', 5-10; Abu Da'ud, 'Al-Wasaya', 2 - Ed.) 
       - The purpose underlying these explanatory directives of the Prophet seems to be that at least two-thirds of the estate should be left aside to be distributed among the legal heirs according to the Qur'anic rules, and that a will could be made in respect of the whole or part of the remaining one-third. 
  - This could be made in favour of either relatives, whether close or distant, who are not legal heirs, or others not related by the blood-tie but who are deserving of assistance. 
  - Likewise, a will could be made in favour of charitable causes which are found worthy of support. 
  - In later times people began to regard this directive regarding testamentary disposal as a recommendation only. 
  - The result was that this rule fell largely into disuse. 
  - It is significant, however, that the Qur'an mentions it as **'an obligation on the God-fearing'**. 
  - Were Muslims to make this injunction an operative institution no trace would remain of the problems which agitate their minds respecting the Islamic law of inheritance , 
    - for example grandchildren whose parents had predeceased their paternal or maternal grandparents and who, under Islamic law, were not entitled to inherit from their grandparents. (The author suggests that re-activating the Qur'anic directive on testamentary disposal is the answer to this and similar problems - Ed.)
 - Please read Maarif-ul-Quran
 - Please revise these concepts whenever there's a need for the setting up of Will!


Ayat 181:
- `Then if anyone alters the will after hearing it,` 
- `this sin shall be upon them who alter.`
- `Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.`
- Subhan Allah, How the names of Allah SWT are being used in the Holy Quran where the fits in prefect fashion!

 Ayat 182:
 - `He who suspects that the testator has committed an error or injustice`
 - `and then brings about a settlement among the parties concerned incurs no sin.`
 - `Surely Allah is Much-Forgiving, Most Compassionate.`
