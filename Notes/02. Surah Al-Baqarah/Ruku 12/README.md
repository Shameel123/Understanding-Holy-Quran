**Ayat 97 - 103**
# Ruku 12

## Overview

Ayat 97:
- `Say: “Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel`
- ` (should know that) he revealed this (Qur’an) to your heart by Allah’s leave:`
- `it confirms the Scriptures revealed before it,`
- `and is a guidance and good tiding to the people of faith.`
  
- Tafhim-ul-Quran
    - The Jews not only reviled the Prophet (peace be on him) and his followers but also God's chosen angel, Gabriel, denouncing him as their enemy, and branding him as the angel of curse rather than of blessing.
    - Since Gabriel communicated the revealed messages with God's approval the abuses of the Jews which were apparently aimed at Gabriel should be considered as directed at God.
    - They abused Gabriel because he had brought the Qur'an from God, and since the Qur'an on the whole confirms the Torah this too became a co-sharer in those abuses.
    - Here there is a subtle suggestion that the wrath of the Jews was, in fact, directed against true guidance and righteousness even though acceptance of these would have brought them good tidings as to their own success.
- Maarif-ul-Quran:
  - The perversity of the Jews was very fertile, and gave them ever-new excuses for denying the Holy Prophet ﷺ . 
  - When they learnt that it was Archangel `Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) (Gabriel )` who brought the Glorious Qur'an to the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، they said that the Archangel (علیہ السلام) was their enemy, as it was through him that rigorous commandments or catastrophic punishments had always descended on them,. and that for this reason they would not accept a Book which had been revealed through his agency. 
  - They also added that they could have accepted the Holy Qur'an, if the `Archangel Mika'il (علیہ السلام) (Michael)` had brought it down, for he is connected with rain and with divine mercy.


Ayat 98:
- `(And if this is the cause of their hostility to Gabriel, let them know) `
- `whoever is an enemy to `
1. `Allah,` 
2. `His Angels and `
3. `His Messengers and to `
4. `Gabriel and `
5. ` Michael `
- `will surely find ``**Allah an enemy to such unbelievers**``.”`

Ayat 99:
- `We surely sent down to you clear verses that elucidate the Truth, (verses) which only the transgressors reject as false.`


Ayat 100:
- `Is it not that every time they made a covenant with Allah a party of them set it aside? `
- `The truth is that most of them do not truly believe.`
  - I believe this Ayah and the Ayah prior to this are direct indication towards us.

Ayat 101:
- `And whenever a Messenger from Allah came to them,` 
- `confirming what they already possessed, `
- `a party of those who had been given the Scripture flung the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they knew nothing,`

Ayat 102:
- `and then followed what the evil ones falsely attributed to the Kingdom of Solomon`
- A reference to a different prophet has been made after 100 Ayah.. `Holy Prophet Solomon PBUH.`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - 'Evil ones' embraces all evil beings, whether they belong to the human species or to the jinn. 
  - Here the reference seems to be to both. When moral and material decline set in among the Israelites, they were overwhelmed with slavery and ignorance, with misery and poverty, and with humiliation and decadence. 
  - They were thus drained of all high ambitions and increasingly turned to magic, sorcery, witchcraft, charms and amulets. 
  - They began to search for facile means such as spells that would spare them hard work and yet ensure the achievement of their desired ends. 
  - At this stage they were misled by the evil ones, **who made them believe that the mighty kingdom and astonishing power of Solomon were merely due to occult sciences and magical formulae,** and that by revealing those they would pass on to them the keys to success. People were so engrossed in such practices that they ignored both the Book of God and anyone who summoned them to truth and righteousness.
- `even though Solomon had never disbelieved;`
- `it is the evil ones who disbelieved, teaching people magic`
- `And they followed what had been revealed to the two angels in Babylon –`
- **`Harut and Marut`**
- ` although these two (angels) never taught it to anyone without first declaring:`
  - `“We are merely a means of testing people; so, do not engage in unbelief.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - There are various opinions on the interpretation of this verse. 
    - My own conclusion is that at the time when the whole Israelite nation was chained in slavery and captivity in Babylonia God sent two angels in human form in order to test the Jews. 
      - In the same way as angels were sent to the people of Lot in the form of handsome youths see (Quran 11: 69 ff. - Ed.), 
    - they were presumably sent to Israel in the form of divines who could work magic and sorcery. 
    - These angels at once began working their magical wonders but they warned the people that their presence among them was designed to test their faith, and that they ought not to jeopardize their After-life by the practice of magic. 
    - Despite the warning it seems that the Israelites had become so fond of their magical artifices that they continued to resort to talismans and sorcery. 
    - It should not surprise anyone that angels came down to earth in human form; 
    - angels are dutiful servants of God's kingdom, and are capable of assuming the form appropriate to the specific task they are required to perform at any particular time. 
    - *Who knows how many angels may be busy performing their duties in our midst even today!* 
    - One might also wonder why angels should teach people magic, which is after all intrinsically evil. 
    - In order to understand this we must remember that the nature of their task was no different from that of an undercover policeman who hands over marked currency notes to a corrupt official as a bribe with the aim of ensuring that he is caught red-handed.

- `And yet they learned from them what `**`might cause division between a man and his wife`**
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This shows that the greatest demand was for magical arts and charms to sow discord between a man and his wife and to procure the eventual seduction of the latter. 
  - This was the depth of moral depravity to which these people had fallen.
  - A people cannot sink to a lower level of moral degeneracy than when adulterous affairs become their favourite pastime, and when seducing a married woman is considered a boastful achievement.
  - The matrimonial relationship is, in truth, the very foundation of man's collective life. 
  - The soundness of human civilization depends on the soundness of the relationship between the two sexes. 
  - Hence, nothing could be worse than the person who strikes at the very foundations of the structure which supports both him and society as a whole. 
  - **There is a Tradition from the Prophet to the effect that Satan sends his agents on their missions to all parts of the world. On their return these agents report their achievements with each mentioning his own special evil act. But Satan is not completely satisfied with any of them. It is only when an agent reports that he has succeeded in separating a wife from her husband that Satan is filled with joy and embraces him. (Bukhari, 'Talaq', 25 - Ed.)** 
  - In the light of this Tradition it is understandable why the angels who were sent to the Israelites to test them were asked to disclose those magical arts which would lead to separation between a husband and his wife, for the inclination of a people to learn such arts is a sure index of its moral decadence.

- `They could not cause harm to anyone `**`except by the leave of Allah,`** 
- `and still they learned what harmed rather than profited them, `
- `knowing well that he who bought it will have no share in the World to Come.` 
- `Evil indeed is what they sold themselves for. Had they but known!`



As per the reference of Tahfim-ul-Quran, I went and studied (Quran 11: 69 ff. - Ed.) which led me to Genesis and here is the link to that:
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+18&version=NIV

To my surprise, the story of Genesis (Bible) matches in quite significant amount of what is revealed in the Holy Quran.


Ayat 103:
`Had they believed and been God-fearing `
`Allah’s reward would have been better! `
`Had they but known`


Maarif-ul-Quran explanation to previous Ayah:
- In connection with these two verses, some commentators have reported certain Judaic traditions, which have given rise to a number of doubts, especially in the minds of Muslims with a Western orientation. 
- Maulana Ashraf Thanavi has provided very simple and clear solutions to these exegetical problems, and we shall reproduce them here:
  1. The Jews were impertinent and senseless enough to attribute magic and sorcery to a prophet -- namely, Sayyidna Sulayman (علیہ السلام) (Solomon). 
     - So, in saying that they used to learn the black arts of the devils (Shayatin شیاطین), the Holy Qur'an takes care to deny, as a parenthesis, such a vile allegation against Sayyidna Sulayman (علیہ السلام)
  2. These verses condemn the Jews for indulging in black magic. 
     - In connection with the verses, some commentators have reported a long and well-known story about a woman called  Zuhrah زُہرہ which is not based on any authentic Islamic tradition. 
     - Those scholars who have found the story to be infringing the regulations of the Shari'ah, have rejected it as mere fiction; 
     - but those who believe that it can be interpreted so as to come in line with the Shari` ah, have not dismissed it totally. 
     - For the moment we are not concerned with the question whether the story is true or false. But what we would like to insist upon is the fact that a proper understanding does in no way depend on this story. 
  3. The Jews knew very well that their indulgence in black magic was not only a sin, but also involved infidelity (Kufr کفر ). 
     - They could also see that such activities would do them no good even in this world,
     -  for their sorcery could not harm anyone except when Allah willed it so. 
     -  Thus their practice went against their knowledge, and they made no use of their understanding to see this discrepancy. 
     -  That is why the Holy Qur'an, to begin with, states that they "knew", and then goes on to negate this 'knowledge' by saying, "Only if they knew!" 
     -  **For, if one does neither act upon what one knows nor tries to understand it properly, one's knowledge is no better than ignorance.**
  4. There was a time when black magic had grown very popular in the world, particularly in Babylon. Seeing its astonishing efficacy, ignorant people began to confuse its effects with the miracles of prophets, and to suppose that the two were identical in nature. Some even looked upon magicians as being holy men, and worthy of being obeyed; still others actually started learning and practising black magic as if it were a good deed bearing a divine sanction.25


**This looks Important to me:**
- In short, this extraordinary veneration for magic and magicians had become a potent source of misguidance. 
- In order to eradicate this misunderstanding, Allah sent down to Babylon two angels, Harut and Marut, for informing the people as to the true nature of magic and as to its different forms, so that they should distinguish it from the miracles of prophets, and keep away from obeying magicians and practising magic themselves. 
- Just as the prophethood of prophets is divinely confirmed through miracles, signs and rational or other arguments, 
- in the same way the angelical nature of Harut and Marut was confirmed on the basis of different signs and arguments, so that people should listen attentively to them and follow their guidance.
