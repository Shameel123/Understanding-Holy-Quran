**Ayat 164 - 167**
# Ruku 19

## Overview

Ayat 164:

- `(To guide) those who use their reason (to this Truth)` 
- `there are many Signs in the `
- `structure of the heavens and the earth, `
- `in the constant alternation of night and day, `
- `in the vessels which speed across the sea carrying goods that are of profit to people,` 
- `in the water which Allah sends down from the sky `
- `and thereby quickens the earth after it was dead, `
- `and disperse over it all manner of animals, `
- `and in the changing courses of the winds and `
- `the clouds pressed into service between heaven and earth.`

Allah mentions His signs in this Ayah! It reminds me of the greatness of the universe and different scientifical wonders shown in "Cosmos" TV Series!

Ayat 165:
- `Yet there are some who take others as equals to Allah`
  - After all of those wonders, people still do such a horrible act..
- `and love them as Allah alone should be loved;`
  - I think, we must also differentiate our love for Allah and for others.
-  `but those who (truly) believe, they love Allah more than all else.` 
-  `If only the wrong-doers were to perceive now – as they will perceive when they will see the chastisement – that all power belongs to Allah alone, and that Allah is severe in chastisement!`

I think, another meaning can be taken as that, we have taken things like phone or other things, to whom we give much more importance and love, which should be given to Allah only..


Ayat 166:
- `At that moment those who have been followed will disown their followers`, 
- `and they will see the chastisement, and their resources will be cut asunder.`

I think, this could relate to the previous Ayah in a manner that, we these days are following people as we should follow Allah SWT... These followers will disown us on the Last Day. These could be (fake) religious scholars, bad politicians, actors, singers, etc...

Ayat 177:
- `And the followers will then say:` 
- `“Oh if only we might return again, we would disown them as they have disowned us?”`
- `Thus Allah will show them their works in a manner causing them` **`bitter regrets.`**
- `Never will they come out of the Fire.`

How *scary* it is.... Allah is presenting us the picture of the Last Day... If we ponder over it and attach it with the Ruku where the changing of Qibla was mentioned so, if we recognize such entities, to whom we give such importance and love, as soon as we recognize them, we should immediately stop their worship, love, attachement and move towards ALLAH SWT!
