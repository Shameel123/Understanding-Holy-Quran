**Ayat 168 - 176**
# Ruku 20

## Overview

Ayat 168:
- `O people! Eat of the lawful and pure things in the earth `
- `and follow not in the footsteps of Satan.`
- `For surely he is your open enemy;`
- I think, it means that if we do not eat lawful and pure things, then we follow cursed footsteps of Satan.

Ayat 169:
- `he only commands you` 
1. `to do evil `
2. `and commit acts of indecency`
3. `and to ascribe to Allah the things concerning which you have no knowledge (that He really is their source)`

- As per this Ayah, we really should be careful about what we say about Allah unless we have PERFECT knowledge about it.
- Satan makes us do 'evil' (Soo') and 'indecent' (Fahashi).

Ayat 170:

- `And when they are told: `
  - `“Follow what Allah has revealed,” `
- `they say: `
  - `“No, we shall follow what we found our forefathers adhering to.” `
- `What! Even if their forefathers were devoid of understanding and right guidance?`

Such a normal scenario of these days, we follow evil and indecent acts as the burden of burden. Even though in entire life, we may not have listened to them but if someone corrects us, we just say the exact statement as mentioned in this Ayah..


Ayat 171:
- `Those who have refused to follow the Way of Allah resemble cattle; `
  - `when the shepherd calls them they hear nothing except shouting and crying;`
- `they are `
  1. `deaf, `
  2. `dumb and `
  3. `blind, `
- `and so they understand nothing.`

Again here, the attribute towards hearing is mentioned first. Then the attribute towards mouth and then towards eyes.


Ayat 172:
- `Believers! `
- `Eat of the pure things wherewith We have provided you for sustenance and `
- `give thanks to Allah`
- `if it is Him that you serve.`
- We must only eat Halal things, and always give thanks to Allah!

Ayat 173:
- `He has made unlawful to you only`
- `carrion and`
  - Wikipedia: Carrion (from Latin caro, meaning "meat") is the decaying flesh of dead animals,
- `blood and the flesh of swine and`
  - Pig
- `that over which there has been pronounced the name of anyone other than Allah’s.`
  - Anything which is eaten with the intention that it is provided by someone else.
- `But he who is constrained (to eat of them) –`
- `and he neither covets them nor exceeds the indispensable limit incurs no sin:`
  - This removed the restriction provided above in a case if someone is in dire need he does not cross limits, nor is his wish, is allowed to eat aformentioned things
- `Allah is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate.`
  - INDEED!

Ayat 174:
- `Those who conceal anything of the Book revealed by Allah`
- `and sell it away for a trifling gain are merely filling their bellies with Fire.1`
- `Allah will neither address them on the Day of Resurrection`
- `nor shall He pronounce them “pure”.`
- `A painful chastisement lies in store for them.`

- This is mentioned again and again that we MUST never conceal the words of ALLAH SWT!
- Such a disgraceful event for not being addressed by the KING of EVERYTHING on the Most Important Day!
- To not be called Pure by Allah SWT... This is the highest possible disgrace one can get!


Ayat 175:
- `They are the ones who bought error in exchange for true guidance,` 
- `and chastisement in exchange for forgiveness.` 
- `How patient they are in enduring the Fire!`

Such a lossy trade:
- Error in exchange for Guidance
- Chastisement in exchange for Forgiveness

Ayat 176:
- `This is so because Allah revealed the Book with the Truth`, 
- `but those who disagreed concerning the Book veered far away from the Truth.`

This is actually very scary, once we start studying it, start gaining knowledge, we must STICK to it and we must not hide its knowledge, even an atom of it.
