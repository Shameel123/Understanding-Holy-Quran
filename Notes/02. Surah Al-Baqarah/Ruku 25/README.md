## Overview
It continues with Hajj Topic


Ayat 197:
- `The months of Hajj are well known.` 
- `Whoever intends to perform Pilgrimage in these months shall abstain from`
  1. `sensual indulgence`
  2. `wicked conduct and `
  3. `quarrelling; `
- `and whatever good you do,` 
- `Allah knows it.` 
- `Take your provisions for the Pilgrimage;` 
- `but, in truth, the best provision is piety.`
- ` Men of understanding, beware of disobeying Me.`


Ayat 198:
- `It is no offence for you to seek the bounty of your Lord during Pilgrimage.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This was another misconception entertained by the pre-Islamic Arabs. They considered it objectionable to do anything relating to one's livelihood during the Pilgrimage. In their view earning one's living was an act of pure worldliness and hence it was bad to indulge in it while engaged in the performance of a religious duty. The Qur'an refutes this and expounds the view that if a person strives to earn his living while observing fully the laws of God his action is tantamount to seeking God's grace and bounty. See( 62: 10 - Ed.)It is no sin if a man sets out to seek God's good pleasure and during the same journey tries to combine that purpose with the quest for permissible worldly benefits.
  - Maarif-ul-Quran:
    - a certain person came to the blessed Companion ` Abdullah ibn ' Umar ؓ and asked: 'We are in the business of renting our camels. We have been doing it since long. People hire our camels to go for their Hajj. We go with them and perform our Hajj. Is it that our Hajj will not be valid?' Sayyidna ' Abdullah ibn ' Umar ؓ said: 'Some one came to the Holy Prophet ﷺ and asked the same question you are asking me. The Holy Prophet ﷺ did not reply to his question at that particular time until the verse لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُوا فَضْلًا مِّن رَّ‌بِّكُمْ was revealed. Then, he called for that person and said, 'Yes, your Hajj is valid.'
- `When you hasten back from [Arafat then remember Allah at al- Mash[ar al-Haram (i.e. al-Muzdalifah),` 
- `and remember Him in the manner He has directed you,` 
- `for before this you were surely in error.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Muslims were asked to give up all those polytheistic and pagan practices that had arisen among the Arabs during the Age of Ignorance and which ran alongside the worship of God thereby adulterating the latter. They were required to consecrate their worship and adoration to God alone according to the guidance He had now revealed through the Prophet.
  

Ayat 199:
- `Then press on even as others press on and implore Allah’s forgiveness;`
  - Since the time of Abraham and Ishmael the recognized practice of the Arabs with regard to Hajj was that on the 9th, Dhu al-Hijjah, they went from Mina to 'Arafat, returning on the morning of the 10th to stay at Muzdalifah. 
  - Later, as the priestly monopoly of the Quraysh became well established, they claimed that it was below their dignity to go to 'Arafat with the ordinary people of Arabia. 
  - As a mark of what they called their distinction, they went to Muzdalifah only (without going to 'Arafat) and returned from there, leaving it to the commoners to go to 'Arafat. 
  - Subsequently Banu Khuza'ah, Banu Kananah and those tribes which were linked by marriage with the Quraysh acquired the same privilege. 
  - Eventually, the status of the tribes allied to the Quraysh came to be considered higher than that of the ordinary Arabs, and these tribes too abandoned the practice of going to 'Arafat. 
  - It is this pride and vainglory which the present verse seeks to undermine. 
  - It is addressed to the Quraysh and the tribes associated with them either through marriage or alliance, and to all those who might be inclined to claim for themselves special privileges and distinctions in the future. 
  - Such people are asked to go to the place to which all others go, to stay with them, to return with them and to seek pardon from God for the fact that they violated the way of Abraham. 
- `Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.`


Ayat 200:
- `And when you have performed your rites remember Allah as you remember your fathers; or remember Him even more.` 
- `There are some (among those that remember Allah) who say: `
  - `“Our Lord, grant us what is good in this world;”` 
- **`such shall have no share in the Hereafter.`**


Ayat 201:
- `There are others who say:` 
  - **`“Our Lord, grant us what is good in this world and what is good in the World to Come, and protect us from the chastisement of the Fire.”`**


Ayat 202:
- `They shall have a portion from what they earned;` 
- **`Allah is quick in reckoning.`**


Ayat 203:
- `And remember Allah through the appointed days.` 
- `It is no sin for him who hastens off and returns in two days, and it is no sin for him who delays the return`
- **`provided he has spent the days in piety.`** 
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - And remember Allah through the appointed days. It is no sin for him who hastens off and returns in two days, and it is no sin for him who delays the return1 provided he has spent the days in piety. Beware of disobeying Allah and know well that to Him you all shall be mustered.
- `Beware of disobeying Allah and know well that to Him you all shall be mustered.`


Ayat 204:
- `Among people there is a kind whose sayings on the affairs of the world fascinate you:`
  - There's a person in this world liked by everyone due to his 'good looked' activities.
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Such a person tends to claim again and again that he was merely a well-wisher and was simply striving to uphold what is true and right, and to promote the welfare of the people rather than doing things for the sake of personal aggrandizement.
- `he calls Allah again and again to bear testimony to his sincerity;`
- `yet he is most fierce in enmity.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The words aladd al-khisam mean 'the most fierce in enmity'. 
    - This would apply to someone who concentrates all his energies on opposing truth, and who resorts to whatever falsehood, dishonesty, treachery and breach of faith he thinks necessary to achieve his ends.


Ayat 205:
- `Whenever he attains authority,`
-  Tahfim-ul-Quran:
   -  The expression idha tawalla can be translated in two ways. First, in the manner of our translation of the text. It can also be translated to make the verse mean that when such people return from sweet and apparently genuine talk, they engage in arrogant and destructive action.
- `he goes about the earth spreading mischief and laying to waste crops and human life,` 
- `even though Allah (whose testimony he invokes) does not love mischief.`


Ayat 205:
- `Whenever he is told: “Fear Allah,” `
- `his vainglory seizes him in his sin.` 
- `So Hell shall suffice for him;` 
- `what a wretched resting place!`


Ayat 205:
- `On the other hand,` 
- `among men there is a kind who dedicates his life seeking to please Allah;` 
- `Allah is Immensely Kind to such devoted servants.`


Ayat 208:
- `Believers!`
- **`Enter wholly into Islam`**
- `and do not follow in the footsteps of Satan for he is your open enemy.`
- I think it means, there are only 2 ways, Allah's way and Satan's way, whatsoever we do not do in accordance with Islam directly falls in the footsteps of Satan!


Ayat 209:
- `And if you stumble in spite of the clear instructions which have come to you,` 
- `then know well that` 
- **`Allah is Most Mighty, Most Wise.`**
- Subhan Allah, I think, here, we are directly being warned just by these two names of Allah SWT i.e., "Al-Aziz" and "Al-Hakeem". Even after the clear instructions, if we still stumble, then Allah is MOST MIGHTY and MOST WISE!!


Ayat 210:
- `Are those people (who are not following the Right Path in spite of admonition and instruction)` 
- `waiting for Allah to come to them` 
- `in canopies of clouds with a retinue of angels and settle the matter finally?` 
- `To Allah shall all matters ultimately be referred.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - These words are indicative of an important fact. Man's test lies in showing whether he accepts reality even though he cannot perceive it directly through his senses; and whether, after having accepted it, he has the required moral stamina to obey God even though he is endowed with the capacity to disobey Him. In sending the Prophets, in revealing the Scriptures, indeed, even in performing miracles, God has always taken care to leave scope for testing man's power of judgement and his moral stamina. He has never disclosed reality to such a degree that man would be inevitably compelled to accept it. For if that were done, nothing would remain to be tested and the very idea of man's success or failure would be meaningless. It is pointed out, therefore, that people should not keep waiting for God and the angels - the devoted servants of His realm - to appear before them. If that were to happen, it would mark the end of everything and there would be no occasion left for man to decide anything. To believe and to bow in submission and obedience to God are of value only so long as the reality is presented in such a way as to make its rejection possible. For, if the Truth were to be fully disclosed and if men were to see with their own eyes God on His Throne of Majesty with the entire universe acting according to His command, what would be the worth of their faith and obedience? If all these things were physically observable not even the most stubborn unbelievers and the worst sinners would dare either to disbelieve or disobey. Acceptance of faith and obedience has value only as long as there remains a veil over reality. The moment when reality is totally unveiled would mark the end of the period granted to man to decide, and of the testing period for him. It would, in fact, be the Day of Judgement.
