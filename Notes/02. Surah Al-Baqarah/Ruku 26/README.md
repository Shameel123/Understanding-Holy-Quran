**Ayat 211 - 216**
# Ruku 26

## Overview

Maarif-ul-Quran:
- Immediately earlier, it was said that opposing truth after clear signs have come, deserves punishment. 
- The first verse here (211) cites the case of the elders of Bani Isra'il who were punished for their hostility to truth despite clear signs given to them.

- Rather than follow the blessed guidance given to them, they chose to stray away from it and, as a result, underwent punishments, for instance, 
- they received the Torah which deserved being accepted but they denied it, 
- consequent to which, they were threatened with Mount Sinai coming down upon them. 
- Again, they heard the Word of Allah which they should have loved and respected but they tinkered with doubts in it and consequently, were struck dead by lightening. 
- Then, again, they were delivered from the Pharaoh through a passage-way made by parting the river, but they showed no gratitude, instead, took to the calf for which they were killed. 
- Further again, they should have been grateful when Mann مَنّ and Salwa سلوا was sent for them but they disobeyed and spoilage set in. 
- When they showed their distaste for it, it stopped coming, throwing them into the toil of growing their own food. 
- Lastly, the chain of prophets that appeared among them from time to time should have been a matter of great satisfaction for them, yet they started killing them for which they were punished, having been deprived of power.

In the wake of such misdeeds,
- some of which find mention in the earlier part of Sarah al-Baqarah, 
- the divine law is that one who changes the blessings or clear signs of Allah, 
- especially after it has come to him when he should have followed its guidance rather than turn back and go astray, 
- then, the ultimate must come to pass, 
- that is, Allah Almighty punishes such a deviant severely.

Ayat 211:
- `Ask the Children of Israel how many Clear Signs We gave them!` 
- `And when a people tamper with Allah’s bounty after it has been bestowed on them –` 
- `then indeed Allah is severe in punishment.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - There are two reasons why this query is addressed to the Children of Israel. 
      1. In the first place, a group of living human beings provide a better source of instruction and admonition than mute archaeological findings. 
      2. In the second place, the Israelites were a people who, having been endowed with Scripture and prophethood, were entrusted with the leadership of the world. By falling prey to worldliness, hypocrisy and other errors of belief and conduct they subsequently lost God's favour. 
    - A people entrusted with the task of universal leadership could derive no better lesson from another people than this one.


Ayat 212:
- **`Worldly life has been made attractive to those who have denied the Truth.`** 
- `Such men deride the men of faith,` 
- **`but the pious shall rank higher than them on the Day of Resurrection.`** 
- **`As for worldly livelihood, Allah grants it to whomsoever He wills without measure.`**


Ayat 213:
- `In the beginning mankind followed one single way.`
- `(Later on this state ended and differences arose.)`
- `Then Allah sent forth Prophets `
- `as heralds of good tidings for the righteous and`
- `as warners against the consequences of evil-doing.`
- `He sent down with them the Book embodying the Truth`
- `so that it might judge among people in their disputes.` 
- `And those who innovated divergent ways rather than follow the Truth` 
- `were none other than those who had received the knowledge of the Truth and clear guidance;` 
- `and they did so to commit excesses against each other.`
- `So by His leave Allah directed the believers to the Right Way in matters on which they disagreed.`
- `Allah guides whomsoever He wills onto a Straight Way.`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - When ignorant people attempt to trace the history of 'religion' they tend to the view that man began his life in the darkness of polytheisrn and that in the course of time, corresponding to man's progress, this darkness gradually receded and light increased till man arrived at monotheism. 
  - The Qur'anic version, however, proclaims that man began his life in full light of the Truth. 
  - God revealed this Truth to the very first man He created, one to whom He intimated the right way of life for man. 
  - Thereafter the human race remained on the Right Way for some time and lived as one community. 
  - Later, however, people invented deviating ways. 
  - This did not happen because Truth had not been communicated to them. 
  - The cause was rather that some people wilfully sought to acquire privileges, benefits and advantages beyond their legitimate limits, and thus subjected others to injustices. 
  - It was in order to enable people to overcome this corruption that God sent His Prophets. 
  - These Prophets were not sent to found separate religions in their own names and bring new religious communities into existence. 
    - Rather the purpose of the Prophets was to illuminate before people the Truth which they had allowed to be lost, and once again make them into one community.


Ayat 214:
- `Do you suppose`
- `that you will enter Paradise untouched by the suffering endured by the people of faith who passed away before you?` 
- `They were afflicted by misery and hardship and were so convulsed that the Messenger and the believers with him cried out:` 
- **`“When will Allah’s help arrive?”`**
- `They were assured: `
- **`“Behold, Allah’s help is close by.”`**
- This Ayah itself is puts fear in one's heart by clearly stating the tough tests one has to go through and yet provides hope at the end! that is, "ALLAH'S HELP IS CLOSE BY!"



Ayat 215:
- `People ask you what they should spend.` 
- `Say: “Whatever wealth you spend let it be for` 
  1. `your parents and `
  2. `kinsmen,` 
  3. `the orphans,` 
  4. `the needy and `
  5. `the wayfarer;` 
- **`Allah is aware of whatever good you do.”`**
  - Note: This series from parents to wayfarer is linked in exact similar series as in Ayah 177


Ayat 216:
- **`Fighting is ordained upon you and it is disliked by you;`**
- **`it may well be that you dislike a thing even though it is good for you,`** 
- **`and it may well be that you like a thing even though it is bad for you.`** 
- **`Allah knows and you do not know.`**

I think, the relation of making Fighting ordained prior to the statement means that we have to fight our Nafs and make OUR OWNSELVES understand that if we do not like something and we get it, or reversed, if we like something and we do not get it then there's something that we do not know and only ALLAH KNOWS!
This is the belief, this is the Tawakkul, a Muslim should have!
Subhan Allah, such beautifully explained and connected at the end of the Ruku!
