**Ayat 130 - 141**
# Ruku 16

## Overview
This Ruku continues from the previous Ruku where the story and greatness of Hazrat Ibrahim AS has been told in clear words.

Ayat 130:
- `And who but a fool would be averse to the way of Abraham? `
- `For it is We Who chose Abraham for Our mission in this world, `
- `and surely in the World to Come he shall be` **`reckoned among the righteous.`**


Ayat 131:
- `Such was Abraham that when his Lord said to him: `
- `“Submit,”1 he said: “I have submitted to the Lord of the Universe.”`


Ayat 132:
- `And Abraham enjoined the same upon his children, and so did Jacob:`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Jacob is especially mentioned since the Children of Israel were his direct descendants.
- `“My children! Behold, Allah has chosen this religion for you.`
- `Remain till death in submission (to Allah).”`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In the Bible the events connected with the death of Jacob (peace be on him) are narrated in detail. 
    - It is amazing that this narrative makes no reference to his testament. 
    - However, the contents of the detailed testament embodied in the Talmud greatly resemble the Qur'anic version. 
    - The Talmudic version reads as follows: 'Serve the Lord your God, and He will deliver ye from all trouble, even as He delivered your fathers.' ' . . . Teach your children to love God, and observe His commandments, in order that their days may be prolonged, for God will guard those who do justly and walk in righteousness through all His ways.' And the sons of Jacob responded, 'All that you have commanded us, our father, we will do. May God be with us!' And Jacob answered: 'The Lord will be with you if ye depart not from His ways to the right hand or to the left.' (The Talmud Selections by H. Polano, London, Frederick Warne & Co., [1877], pp. 113-14.)


Ayat 133:
- `Why, were you witnesses when death came to Jacob? `
- `He asked his children: “Whom will you serve after me?” `
- `They said: “We shall serve your God, the God of your forefathers, Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, the One God, and unto Him do we submit.”`


Maarif-ul-Quran:
- The previous verses have defined the religion of Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) and the essence of Islam. Now, these two verses bring before us another aspect of the question. Call it the religion of Sayyidna Ibrahim or Islam, it is in any case meant for the whole world. Then why have the descendants of Sayyidna Ibrahim and Sayyidna Ya` qub (علیہم السلام) been specifically mentioned here, and why should have these two great prophets been so particular in giving this counsel to their sons?
- [...]
- So, even prophets love their children, the only difference being that while ordinary men consider the good things of this world alone to be worthwhile and wish to leave to their children as much of these as they can, in the eyes of the prophets and their genuine followers the only thing that counts is Iman ایمان (faith) and good deeds - in one word, Islam - and it is this eternal wealth which they wish and strive to transmit wholly to their descendants.
- [...]
- From this example of the prophets we also learn that it is the duty of the parents and the right of the children that one should first of all take care of the spiritual health of one's own children, and worry about others only afterwards. This principle rests on three considerations. 
  - Firstly, one's children are, on account of the special relationship with the parents, likely to accept the counsel more easily and thoroughly than others, and may later on be of great help in the efforts which one makes in the service of Islam.
  - Secondly, the easiest and the most effective way of transmitting the Truth to a whole people is that the head of each family should take upon himself the responsibility of teaching and training the members of his family.[...]
  - Thirdly, one can observe for oneself that if the close relations or the members of his family do not support a man in what he wishes to teach, or do not seem to be acting upon it, his teachings do not succeed so well with others. When the Holy Prophet took upon himself the prophetic function, the usual reply of his listeners was that he should first convince his own clan, the Quraysh, before turning to others. But when his own clan accepted Islam and the process had been completed at the time of the conquest of Makkah, the world saw, as the Holy Qur'an reports يَدْخُلُونَ فِي دِينِ اللَّـهِ أَفْوَاجًا "People entering Allah's religion in throngs." (110:2)


Please note: Hazrat Yaqub AS is the father of Hazrat Yousuf AS..


Ayat 134:
- `Now, they were a people who passed away. `
- `Theirs is what they have earned, and yours is what you have earned. `
- `You shall not be asked concerning what they did.`

I think, this is such a WONDERFUL explanation.. The responsibility (from previous two Ayah) for the head of the family is to teach the kids..
I think, this Ayah is directed towards us, not our parents, they earned whatever the earned. But, we will have to provide answers for our own deeds!!


Ayat 135:
- `They say: `
  - `“Be Jews,” or “Be Christians.” `
  - `“Then you will be rightly guided.” `
- `Say to them: `
  - `“No, follow exclusively the way of Abraham who was not one of those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity.”`

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- In order to grasp the subtlety, of this remark two things should be borne in mind.
  -  First, that in comparison to Islam, the primordial religion, both Judaism and Christianity are later products. 
     -  The name Judaism, as well as the characteristic features and elaborate body of laws and regulations associated with it. emerged during the third or fourth century, B.C. 
     -  As for Christianity. in the sense of the body of dogmas and theological doctrines which characterize it, it came into existence long after Jesus (peace be on him). 
     -  The question that naturally arises is that, if man's guidance depends on following Judaism or Christianity, how can Abraham and other Prophets and righteous people who are accepted as having been rightly-guided even by the Jews and Christians be considered so when they were born several centuries before the birth of Judaism and Christianity? 
     -  If they were rightly-guided from whom did they receive their guidance? 
     -  Obviously their source of guidance and inspiration was neither Judaism nor Christianity since, in their times, these did not exist. 
     -  So man's rectitude does not depend on those characteristics which led to the rise of Jewish and Christian particularisms; 
     -  it rather depends on adopting that universal way to Truth which has guided and inspired men throughout the ages. 
     -  Second. the Scriptures of the Jews and Christians attest that Abraham believed that worship, adoration, service and obedience were due to God alone, and that it was his mission to have none associated with God in His attributes and rights. 
     -  Since polytheistic elements had made inroads into Judaism and Christianity it was obvious that both had strayed from the way of Abraham.

Ayat 136:
- `Say: `
- `“We believe in Allah, `
- `and in what has been revealed to us and to `
  - `Abraham, `
  - `Ishmael, `
  - `Isaac, `
  - `Jacob `
  - `and the descendants (of Jacob) `
  - `and in what was given to Moses `
  - `and Jesus `
  - `and in what the other Prophets received from their Lord. `
- `We make no distinction between any of them,1 and we are those who submit to Allah.”`

I think, the more general overview of lineage has been mentioned here. That, we must believe in Allah, all the Prophets AS and the Scripture they recieved from Allah and we MUST NEVER make distinctions among Prophets AS.


Ayat 137:
- `And then if they come to believe as you believe,` 
- `they are on right guidance; `
- `and if they turn away, `
- `then quite obviously they have merely fallen into opposition to the Truth. `
- `Allah will suffice you for protection against them. `
- `He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.`


Ayat 138:
- `Say: “Take on Allah’s colour.” `
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This verse can be translated in two ways. One of these is: 
      - `'We have taken on Allah's colour.'` 
    - The other is: 
      - `'Take on Allah's colour.'` 
    - On the eve of the advent of Christianity the Jews followed the practice of bathing everyone who embraced their religion. 
    - This ritual bath signified that all his previous sins had been washed away and that he had adopted a different colour for his life. 
    - This practice was subsequently taken over by the Christians and is termed 'baptism'. 
    - Not only converts but even new-born babies were baptized. 
    - The Qur'anic remarks here refer to this institution. 
    - The Qur'an says in effect: 
      - **'Of what use is this formal baptism? What really is worth doing is to adopt the colour of God, and it is not water that gives one this colour but actual service and devotion to God.'**
- `And whose colour is better than Allah’s? `
- `It is Him that we serve.`


Ayat 139:
- `Say (O Prophet):`
  - `“Will you then dispute with us concerning Allah when He is our Lord and your Lord?` 
  - `Our deeds are for us and your deeds are for you. `
  - `And it is Him that we serve exclusively.”`

I think, this Ayah, in this age, refer to the the places where we muslims are fighting among our ownselves even though we all believe in Allah SWT.
The same point of 'owning deeds' has been made afterwards.
I think, could this mean, we should try to avoid this scenario? 


Ayat 140:
- `Or do you claim that `
- `Abraham and Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob and the descendants (of Jacob) were “Jews” or “Christians?” `
  - The same series as followed in Ayah 136 except Hazrat Musa AS and Hazrat Jesus AS but see, the people who diverted from their ways have been mentioned here. Subhan Allah! :)
- `Say: “Who has greater knowledge, you or Allah?”`
- `Who does greater wrong than he who conceals a testimony he has received from Allah? `
  - This could be directed to us, once we learn Islam and hide information from others knowing that hiding the information would benefit us.. This is the GREATER WRONG!
- `Allah is not heedless of the things you do.`
  - Allah SEES whatever we do.


Ayat 141:
- `Now, they were a people who passed away. `
- `Theirs is what they earned, and yours is what you earn; `
- `you shall not be questioned concerning what they did.`

The exact same replica of Ayat 134, there must be some wisdom behind this repition that I cannot yet understand. May Allah help me understanding this at later stage. Ameen!
