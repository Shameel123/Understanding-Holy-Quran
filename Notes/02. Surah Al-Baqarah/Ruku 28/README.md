# Ruku 28

## Overview


Ayat 222:
- `They ask you about menstruation.` 
- `Say: “It is a state of impurity; so keep away from women in the state of menstruation,` 
- `and do not approach them until they are cleansed.` 
- `And when they are cleansed,2 then come to them as Allah has commanded you.”` 
- `Truly, Allah loves those who abstain from evil and keep themselves pure.`

Ayat 223:
- `Your wives are your tilth;` 
- `go, then, into your tilth as you wish` 
- `but take heed of your ultimate future`
- `and avoid incurring the wrath of Allah.` 
- `Know well that one Day you shall face Him.` 
- `Announce good tidings to the believers.`


Ayat 224:

- `Do not swear by Allah in your oaths` 
- `if they are intended to hinder you from`
  1. `virtue,` 
  2. `piety and` 
  3. `promoting the good of mankind.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Authentic Traditions indicate that if a person takes a vow and discovers later that righteousness and common good are best served by breaking that vow then he should do so. Expiation consists in either feeding or providing clothes for ten poor people, or setting free a slave, or fasting for three days.
      - I think this is here during the discussion of spouses because people in anger takes such oath and this Ayah gives permission to break such oaths which does not bring virture, piety or promote good for others.
- `Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All- Knowing.`
  - Subhan Allah. Allah hears everything and He knows why the oath was taken and why is it being broken now.

Ayat 225:

- `Allah will not take you to task for the oaths you utter in vain,` 
- `but will certainly take you to task for the oaths you utter in earnest.` 
- `Allah is All-Forgiving, All-Forbearing.`
  - See, the concept of oath here has been revised again!
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This refers to oaths which one utters either through habit or without any intent and purpose. The breach of such vows neither entails expiation nor makes man liable to God's reproach.


Ayat 226:
- `For those who vow abstinence from their wives there is a respite of four months.` 
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In the legal terminology of Islam this is known as ila'. It is obvious that harmony and cordiality do not always prevail in matrimonial life. 
    - There are occasions when strains and tensions develop, leading to discord and estrangement. 
    - But the Law of God does not approve of that discord which causes a husband and wife, who are legally tied to one another in matrimony, to remain for all practical purposes alienated from one another as if they had ceased to be spouses. 
    - For this kind of abnormal discord and estrangement God has fixed a limit of **four months** during which the spouses are required either to settle their difference, or to break the tie of wedlock so that each becomes free to contract marriage with someone with whom a harmonious matrimonial relationship appears more likely.
    - Since the verse mentions 'taking a vow', the Hanafi and Shafi'i jurists consider the injunction to be applicable only when a husband has taken a vow not to have sexual relations with his wife. 
    - According to them, the injunction does not apply if the husband merely forsakes sexual relations with his wife without taking any vow to that effect. 
    - The Maliki jurists are, however, of the opinion that irrespective of whether a person has taken a vow, the maximum permissible limit for abstaining from sexual relations in wedlock is four months. A statement to that effect is also attributed to Ahmad b. Hanbal. (See Ibn Rushd, Bidayat al-Mujtahid, vol. 2, pp. 98 ff. - Ed.) 
    - According to 'Ali, Ibn Abbas and Hasan al-Basri, this injunction is related to the cessation of sexual relations as a result of unpleasantness in the relationship of the spouses. 
    - It would not apply, however, if a husband were to decide to abandon sexual relations with his wife out of some beneficial consideration - say because the wife is breastfeeding - at a time when their relationship was pleasant. 
    - According to other jurists, however, any vow which prevents sexual intercourse between a husband and wife is ila', and ought not to last longer than four months irrespective of the state of the matrimonial relationship when it was taken. (See Jassas, Ahkam al-Qur'an, vol. 1, pp. 355 ff - Ed.)
- `Then, if they go back on their vow they will find that Allah is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate.`


Ayat 227:
- `And if they resolve on divorce,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - According to 'Uthman, Ibn Mas'ud, Zayd ibn Thabit and others the limit for the restoration of matrimonial relations is four months. 
    - The mere termination of that period proves that the husband has decided to repudiate the marriage and so divorce automatically ensues. 
    - It will be reckoned as an irrevocable (ba'in) repudiation. 
    - This means that separation between the spouses will come into force and the husband will not have the right to revoke it during the period of waiting ('iddah). 
    - The two parties will, however, have the right to recontract marriage by mutual consent. 
    - Statements from 'Umar, 'Ali, Ibn 'Abbas, and also a statement from Ibn 'Umar, have been reported in support of this doctrine and have been accepted by the Hanafi jurists as the basis of their doctrine. 
    - Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib, Makhul, Zuhri,. and some other early jurists agree with this doctrine to the extent that divorce comes into force after four months. 
    - But they consider that the husband may revoke it during the period of waiting; and even after the lapse of that period the spouses may recontract marriage by mutual consent. 
    - However, 'A'ishah, Abu al-Darda' and the majority of the jurists of Madina are opposed to this opinion and hold that after four months the matter should be placed before the court when the judge will order the husband either to resume matrimonial relations with his wife or divorce her. 
      - Statements from 'Umar and 'Ali as well as a statement from Ibn 'Umar have come down in support of this doctrine. This opinion has been accepted by Malik and Shafi'i. (See Jassas, vol. 1, pp. 359 f. - Ed.)
- `surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.`

Ayat 228:
- `Divorced women shall keep themselves in waiting for three menstrual courses and it is unlawful for them, if they believe in Allah and the Last Day, to hide whatever Allah might have created in their wombs.` 
- `Should their husbands desire reconciliation during this time they are entitled to take them back into wedlock.`
- `Women have the same rights against their men as men have against them;` 
- `but men have a degree above them.` 
- `Allah is All- Powerful, All-Wise.`
