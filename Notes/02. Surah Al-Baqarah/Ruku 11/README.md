**Ayat 87 - 96**
# Ruku 11

## Overview
Bani Israel are addressed in this Ruku as well.
This Ruku links back to:
  - Ruku 6 for the incident of worshipping of calf.
  - Ruku 8 Ayat 63 when Mount Toor was raised over their heads.


Ayah 87:
- `Surely We gave Moses the Scripture and caused a train of Messengers to follow him `
  - This suggests that there came number of Prophets (PBUH) after Hazrat Moosa AS.
- `and then sent Jesus, the son of Mary, with Clear Proofs and supported him with the spirit of holiness`
  - Maarif-ul-Quran:
    - Allah helped and supported Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) through Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) in several ways.
      - 1.  He was conceived through the breath of the Archangel.
      - 2. Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) protected him against being touched by Satan at the time of his birth.
      - 3. The Archangel always accompanied him in order to defend him against the hostility of the Jews.
      - 4. It was through him that Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) was raised to the heavens.
  - `But is it not true that every time a Messenger brought to you something that was not to your liking, you acted arrogantly:`
    - `you called some Messengers liars`
      - Generally the case with every prophet. 
    - `and killed others?`
      - Linked with Hazrat Yahya (John) AS and Hazrat Zakariya AS.

Ayat 88:
- **`They say: “Our hearts are well-protected.”`**
- `No! The fact is that Allah has cursed them because of their denying the Truth.`
- `So, scarcely do they believe.`


Ayat 89:
- **`And now that there has come to them a Book from Allah, how are they treating it?`**
  - I beleive this is directed towards us...
- ` Even though it confirms the Truth already in their possession`
  - Sometimes, in our heart, we know what is right, we still ask others to justify it as wrong so that we somehow remain at peace but whenever we open and understand Holy Quran, it *confirms the truth* that we already have in our *posession*
- `and even though they had prayed for victory against the unbelievers,`
- `and yet when that Book came to them`
- `and they recognized it`
- `hey refused to acknowledge its Truth.`
- Maarif-ul-Quran:
  - The most authentic evidence in this connection is that of Safiyah, a wife of the Prophet,
  - She was herself the daughter of one learned Jewish scholar (Huyayy b. Akhtab) and the niece of another (Abu Yasir). 
  - She says that when the Prophet migrated to Madina both her father and uncle went to meet him and conversed with him for quite a while. 
  - When they returned home, she heard the following conversation: 
    - Uncle: Is he really the same Prophet whose advent has been prophesied in our Scriptures?
    - Father: By God, he is. Uncle: Do you  believe that? 
    - Father: Yes.. 
    - Uncle. Then what do you intend to do? 
    - Father: 1 will continue to oppose him and will not let his claim prevail as long as I live.
- ` Allah’s curse be upon the unbelievers.`


Ayat 90:
- `Evil indeed is what they console themselves with.`
- `They deny the guidance revealed by Allah,`
- `grudging that He chose to bestow His gracious bounty (of revelation and prophethood) on some of His servants whom He willed.`
  - It is the will of Allah, to whom he appoints as a Prophet and from whichever lineage He wills.
- `Thus they have brought on themselves wrath after wrath, and a humiliating chastisement is in store for such unbelievers.`
   
Ayat 91:
- `When they are told: “Believe in what Allah has revealed,”`
- `They say: “We believe only in what was revealed to us (Israel).” `
- `They deny everything else even though it be the Truth which confirms what they possess.`
- `Say (to them): “If indeed you are believers, why is it that in the past you killed the Prophets of Allah (who were from Israel)?”`

Ayat 92:

`Moses came to you with clear proofs` 
`and yet you were so wont to wrong-doing that as soon as he was gone you took to worshipping the calf.`
 - This is the 3rd time the mention of 'calf' has been made in this Surah.
 - This link back to Ruku 6 where the incident was explained.
  
  Ayat 93:
  - `Recall the covenant We made with you and caused the Mount to tower above you, stressing:`
  - **`“Hold to what We have given you with full strength and give heed to it.”`**
    - I think this could directly relate with us, for us, we have been provided with Holy Quran and we must have to LISTEN to Holy Quran with FIRMNESS بِقُوَّةٍۢ وَٱسْمَعُوا۟ ۖ
  - `But their forefathers said:`
    - **`“We hear, but we disobey”`**
      - `قَالُوا۟ سَمِعْنَا` is written, could this mean, "they said"?
      - `انہوں نے کہا` is written in `Bayan-ul-Quran` by `Dr. Israr`
      - Does this mean, we *ourselves* with our actions admit that we "DISOBEY" Quran?
  - `– for their hearts were overflowing with love for the calf because of their unbelief.`
    - After studying this, I think, I have understood the meaning of calf...
    - It is nothing but the reference to us in our modern age..
    - Just like they were involved with worship of calf within 40 days, similar to that, we as Muslim Ummah went astray right after Holy Prophet PBUH left us (as it can be read, that 2 fitna of Zakat and the fitna of fake prophet)
    - Similar to this statement, our hearts are also overflowing with the love of *calf* which keeps us stray from the straight path and from the word of Allah SWT.
  - `Say: “If you are people of faith, then evil are the things that your faith enjoins upon you.”`


Ayat 94:
- `Say to them: “If indeed the Last Abode with Allah is yours, in exclusion of other people,`
  - This was directed towards jews because they believe that Akhirah is reserved for them and they are going to get good results at the end.
- `then long for death if you are truthful.”`
  - This directs such people to wish for death if they are so certain of it.
  - I believe this instruction fits us DIRECTLY as we believe that Jews, Christians, Hindus and all others except 'MUSLIMS' are just gonna go to Jannat, one way or another then why we are *afraid to die* ?? This directly includes me and if we are afraid to die then we really should read and understand what's going on and how we are being taught in simplest possible manner.


Ayat 95:
- `But they shall never long for it `
- `because of the (evil) deeds they have committed;`
- `Allah is well aware of the wrong-doers.`

 
 Ayat 96:
 - `You will certainly find them most eager to cling on to life,`
 - `indeed even more eager than those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity.`.
   - This again was directed towards Jews that they cling to life, even more than the ones who do IMMENSE form of shirk.
   - Indeed, it now relates with us as we have clung to this life and we are not willing to die at all...
 - `Each one of them wishes to live a thousand ye ars although the bestowal of long life cannot remove him from chastisement.`
 - **`Allah sees whatever they do.`**
