Ayat 183:
- `Believers! Fasting is enjoined upon you, as it was enjoined upon those before you,` 
- `that you become God-fearing.`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Like most other injunctions of Islam those relating to fasting were revealed gradually.
  - In the beginning the Prophet (peace be on him) had instructed the Muslims to fast three days in every month, though this was not obligatory.
  - When the injunction in the present verse was later revealed in 2 A.H., 
  - a degree of relaxation was introduced: it was stipulated that those who did not fast despite their capacity to endure it were obliged to feed one poor person as an expiation for each day of obligatory fasting missed see (verse 184).
  - Another injunction was revealed later see (verse 185) and here the relaxation in respect of able-bodied persons was revoked.
  - However, for the sick, the traveller, the pregnant, the breast-feeding women and the aged who could not endure fasting, the relaxation was retained. (See Bukhari, 'Tafsir al-Qur'an', 25; Tirmidhi, 'Sawm', 21; Nasai, 'Siyam', 51, 62, 64; Ibn Majah, 'Siyam', 12; Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 3, p. 104; vol. 4, pp. 347 and 418; vol. 5, p. 29 - Ed.)


Ayat 184:
- `Fasting is for a fixed number of days,` 
- `and if one of you be sick,` 
- `or if one of you be on a journey,`
- `you will fast the same number of other days later on.`
- `For those who are capable of fasting (but still do not fast) there is a redemption: feeding a needy man for each day missed.` 
- `Whoever voluntarily does more good than is required, will find it better for him;`
  - Tahfium-ul-Quran:
    - This act of extra merit could either be feeding more than the one person required or both fasting and feeding the poor
- `and that you should fast is better for you, if you only know.`
  - Tahfium-ul-Quran:
    - **Here ends the early injunction with regard to fasting which was revealed in 2 A.H. prior to the Battle of Badr.**
    - This means, Sahabah fought the battle while Fasting! Subhan Allah! 
    -  The verses that follow were revealed about one year later and are linked with the preceding verses since they deal with the same subject.


Ayat 185:
- `During the month of Ramadan `**`the Qur'an`**` was sent down as a guidance to the people with Clear Signs of the true guidance and as the Criterion (between right and wrong).` 
- `So those of you who live to see that month should fast it,` 
- `and whoever is sick or on a journey should fast the same number of other days instead.`
- `Allah wants ease and not hardship for you so that you may complete the number of days required,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Whether a person should or should not fast while on a journey is left to individual discretion. 
    - We find that among the Companions who accompanied the Prophet on journeys some fasted whereas others did not; 
    - none objected to the conduct of another. 
    - The Prophet himself did not always fast when travelling. 
    - On one journey a person was so overwhelmed by hunger that he collapsed; 
    - the Prophet disapproved when he learned that the man had been fasting. 
    - During wars the Prophet used to prevent people from fasting so that they would not lack energy for the fight. 
    - It has been reported by 'Umar that two military expeditions took place in the month of Ramadan. 
    - The first was the Battle of Badr and the second the conquest of Makka. 
    - On both occasions the Companions abstained from fasting, and, according to Ibn 'Umar, on the occasion of the conquest of Makka the Prophet proclaimed that people should not fast since it was a day of fighting. 
    - In other Traditions the Prophet is reported to have said that people should not fast when they had drawn close to the enemy, since abstention from fasting would lead to greater strength. (See Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 3, p. 329, and vol. 5, pp. 205 and 209: Darimi, ' Sawm', 41; Muslim, 'Siyarn', 92; Nasai, 'Siyam', 47; Bukhari, 'Maghazi', 71; Muslim, 'Siyam', 102; Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 3, pp. 21, 35, 46; Tirmidhi, 'Sawm', 18, Nasa'i. 'Siyam', 52; Bukhari , 'Jihad', 29; Muslim, 'Siyam', 98; Abu Da'ud, 'Sawm' 42; Muslim, 'Siyam', 102, 103, 105; Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad vol. 2, 99; Tirmidhi, : 'Sawm', 19 - Ed.)The duration of a journey for which it becomes permissible for a person to abstain from fasting is not absolutely clear from any statement of the Prophet, (cf. relevant Traditions Abu Da'ud, 'Sawm', 46, 47; Nasai , 'Siyam', 54, 55; Malik, Muaatta', 'Siyam', 21, 27 - Ed.) 
    - In addition the practice of the Companions was not uniform. 
    - It would seem that any journey which is commonly regarded as such, and which is attended by the circumstances generally associated with travelling, should be deemed sufficient justification for not fasting. 
    - Jurists agree that one does not have to fast on the day of commencing a journey; one may eat either at the point of departure or after the actual journey has commenced. 
    - Either course is sanctioned by the practice of the Companions. 
    - Jurists, however, are not agreed as to whether or not the residents of a city under attack may abstain from fasting even though they are not actually travelling. 
    - Ibn taymiyah favours the permissibility of abstention from fasting and supports his view with vcry forceful arguments.

- `magnify Allah for what He has guided you to, and give thanks to Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This indicates that fasting need not be confined, exclusively, to Ramadan. 
    - For those who fail to fast during that month owing to some legitimate reason God has kept the door of compensation open during other months of the year so that they need not be deprived of the opportunity to express their gratitude to Him for His great bounty, in revealing the Qur'an. 
    - It should he noted here that fasting in Ramadan has not only been declared an act of worship and devotion and a means to nourish piety but has also been characterized as an act of gratefulness to God for His great bounty of true guidance *in the form of the Qur'an*. 
    - In fact, the best way of expressing gratitude for someone's bounty or benevolence is to prepare oneself, to the best of one's ability, to achieve the purpose for which that bounty has been bestowed. 
    - The Qur'an has been revealed so that we may know the way that leads to God's good pleasure, follow that way ourselves and direct the world along it. 
    - Fasting is an excellent means by which to prepare ourselves for shouldering this task. 
    - Hence fasting during the month of the revelation of the Qur'an is more than an act of worship and more than an excellent course of moral training; 
    - it is also an appropriate form for the expression of our thankfulness to God for the bounty of the Qur'an.


Ayat 186:
Following part of the Ayah has been well-explained by Nauman Ali Khan:
`وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِى عَنِّى فَإِنِّى قَرِيبٌ ۖ`
Whenever, the Muslims ask Holy Prophet PBUH about Allah, Allah responds Himsef that He is near.
This is such a strong statement!!

- `(O Muhammad), when My servants ask you about Me, tell them` 
- **`I am quite near;`** 
- **`I hear and answer the call of the caller whenever he calls Me.`** 
- `Let them listen to My call and believe in Me;`
- `perhaps they will be guided aright.`



Ayat 187:
- `It has been made lawful for you to go in to your wives during the night of the fast.` 
- `They are your garment, and you are theirs.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Just as nothing intervenes between a person's body and his clothes, so nothing can intervene between a man and his wife; it is a relationship of inalienable intimacy.
- `Allah knows that you used to betray yourselves and He mercifully relented and pardoned you.` 
- `So you may now associate intimately with your wives and benefit from the enjoyment Allah has made lawful for you,`
- `and eat and drink at night until you can discern the white streak of dawn against the blackness of the night;`
- `then (give up all that and) complete your fasting until night sets in.`
- `But do not associate intimately with your wives during the period when you are on retreat in the mosques.`
- `These are the bounds set by Allah; do not, then, even draw near them.`
- `Thus does Allah make His Signs clear to mankind that they may stay away from evil.`


Ayat 188:
- `Do not usurp one another’s possessions by false means, nor proffer your possessions to the authorities so that you may sinfully and knowingly usurp a portion of another’s possessions.`
- I could not understand its relevance with the topic of Ramadan. Does this become common during Ramadan?
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - One meaning of this verse is that people should not try to seek illegitimate benefits by bribing magistrates. 
  - Another meaning is that when a person is aware that the property, he claims rightfully belongs to someone else, he should not file a judicial petition either because the other party lacks the evidence to support their case or because by trickery and cunning the petitioner can usurp that property. 
  - It is possible that the judicial authority would decide the case in favour of the false claimant on the basis of the formal strength of the claim, but as this judicial verdict would merely be the result of the chicanery to which the claimant had resorted he would not become its rightful owner. 
  - In spite of the judgement of the court the property would remain unlawful for him in the sight of God. 
  - **It has been reported in a Tradition that the Prophet said: 'I am merely a human being and you bring to me your disputes. It is possible that some of you will be more impressive in argument than others, so that 1 may give judgement in favour of one on the basis of what 1 hear. Beware that if 1 award to someone what belongs to his brother, I will have assigned to him a lump of Fire.' (Bukhari, 'Shahadat', 27; Muslim, 'Aqdiayah', 4; Abu Da'ud , 'Aqdiayah', 7; Tirmidhi, 'Ahkam', 11, 18; Nasai 'Qudat', 12, 33; 1bn Majah, 'AhkAm', 5, etc. - Ed.)**
