## Overview


Ayat 152:
- **`So remember Me and I shall remember you;`**
- `give thanks to Me and do not be ungrateful to Me for My favours.`
`فَٱذْكُرُونِىٓ أَذْكُرْكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُوا۟ لِى وَلَا تَكْفُرُونِ ١٥٢` 



Ayat 153:
- `Believers!`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Since the ummah has been invested with world leadership, a set of necessary directives is now provided for its guidance. 
    - Before laying down these directives it seemed necessary to caution the Muslims that the office which had been conferred on them was indeed no bed of roses. 
    - On the contrary, it was a great and perilous responsibility. 
    - Once they undertook it, they would be subjected to all kinds of afflictions, put to all kinds of trials and tribulations and made to bear all kinds of deprivation. 
    - If, however, the Muslims persisted along the path of God despite the perils they would be rewarded with God's favour in full measure.
- `Seek help in patience and in Prayer; `
- `Allah is with those that are patient.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - To acquire the strength that is needed to bear this heavy burden of responsibility the believers should do two things: 
      - they should develop patience and they should strengthen themselves by devoting themselves to Prayer.
    - Later we shall encounter elaborations which will show that 'patience' is a word embracing a whole set of moral virtues of the utmost importance. 
    - 'Patience' is indeed an indispensable key to success. 
    - Likewise, we shall later have occasion to note in some detail how Prayer prepares the Muslims, both as individuals and as a collective body, to carry out their mission.


Ayat 154:
- `And do not say of those who are killed in the way of Allah that they are dead; `
- `they are alive even though you have no knowledge of their life.`

Maarif-ul-Quran:
- According to Islamic traditions the dead person is given some kind of a "new life" in Barzakh44 برزخ which develops in him a sensitivity to punishment and reward. 
- Regardless of whether one is a believer or disbeliever, virtuous or vicious, this taste of life-in-Barzakh برزخ is given to everybody. 
- However, the life there has many categories: one of them is for the general lot, while some others are for prophets and virtuous people. 
- The later ones vary in their degree of excellence. A number of scholars have collected relevant facts to assert their points of views, about the life-in-Barzakh برزخ . All of them cannot be summed up here. 
- I will restrict myself here, to presenting the considered and the very balanced view of my worthy teacher Maulana Ashraf ` Ali (رح) of Than a Bhawan; incidentally, his view is in close conformity with the teachings of the Holy Qur'an, as also, those of the Holy Prophet ﷺ .

- 44. An intermediary stage which begins with death and stretches till the Doomsday.

- The Martyrs are not dead

- One who dies in the cause of Allah is a Shahid (Martyr) and, although, it is correct and even allowed to call him "dead", yet we are forbidden to regard their death like ordinary deaths. 
- For, though, life in Barzakh برزخ is given to' everybody which gives him perception of reward and punishment but Shahid شھید in the Barzakh برزخ life is qualitatively different from the one given to other persons. 
- The distinction a Shahid شھید has over others in Barzakh برزخ is that in effect, for the fullness and sensitivity of life, his perception is, keener and deeper. 
- As, for instance, the life sensation is there in finger tips, as also, it is there in heels, but the sensitivity of finger tips is sharper than that of heels. 
- The effect of the finer life-quality of a Shahid شھید in Barzakh برزخ reaches his physical body as well; whereas ordinarily bodies remain unaffected. 
- Consequently, a Shahid's body does not waste away, decay or mingle with dust. 
- On the contrary it retains it freshness and a semblance of being alive too. 
- This is duly endorsed by Ahadith and observations. They are, therefore, reported as living and we are forbidden to call them dead. 
- However, for all worldly purposes they are treated at par with the dead; 
- their properties are divided and their wives can remarry. 
- Lives of prophets in Barzakh برزخ have a further distinction. 
- Their life-sensitivity is even finer and keener than that of Shahids. 
- In Barzakh برزخ their bodies retain their life-quality and, in some ways, its manifestation is extended to this life as well; 
- their properties are not divided and their wives cannot again enter into wedlock.

- The most strong in the retention of this life-quality are the prophets, then are the Shahids شُهَدَا ، then the ordinary human beings. 
- Nevertheless, according to some ahadith some of the men of Allah and virtuous people share this excellence with Shahids شُهَدَا . 
- Apparently, those who die while exercising stringent discipline against their selves (مجاھدہ النفس) are ranked with Shahids شُهَدَا . 
- In other words, though this verse specifically refers to Shahids شُهَدَا as against the broad humanity, it does not, for that reason, exclude the virtuous and the truthful. 
- If, therefore, the body of a Shahid returns to dust, as bodies of ordinary persons, generally do, the chances are that the person did not, perhaps,, die in the cause of Allah which is the only criterion of martyrdom (Shahadah شهَادہ).

- In case a person who fulfilled all the prerequisites of martyrdom and, beyond, any doubt, died in the cause of Allah and whose martyrdom (Shahadah شهَادہ) has been unmistakably and repeatedly demonstrated, his body must not, on the authority of a hadith , return to dust. 
- If, in spite of Ahadith, the body mingles with earth (what, in fact, has made the author of Ruh al-Ma` ani doubt is how can, in spite of Ahadith, the body of a Shahid شھید be eaten away by earth) the explanation would be that according to Hadith the body would not return to dust; however, it does not deny the process of decay and decomposition caused by other factors like geo-chemical reaction, body enzymes, and bacteria. Neither does it confute the verse.

- Other compound objects like weapons, medicines, food, and the commingling of various natural elements like water, fire and air had, undoubtedly, their effects on the bodies of prophets in this world and, obviously, the life-quality of Shahid شھید in Barzakh برزخ is not superior to that of the prophets in this world; if, therefore, the other ingredients register their impact on the bodies of Shahids شُهَدَا in برزخ Barzakh it does not confute, in any sense, the meanings of Ahadith which say the Shahids' bodies are sacred to earth.

- Another answer is that the distinction which Shahids have over others is apparent from the fact that, comparatively, their bodies remain unspoiled for a pretty long time, although the likelihood of their disintegration in the longer run does exist. 
- The aim of the hadith should, therefore, be explained by saying that the immunity from decay for such a long time is, in itself, an excess on the customary behaviour of dead bodies. Eternal preservation, and preservation for a considerable long time, both are an "excess on the customary behaviour" of dead bodies.

- By the words, " لَّا تَشْعُرُ‌ونَ ": "you perceive not", the Holy Qur'an asserts the fact that the life in Barzakh برزخ transcends all sensory perceptions.

Ayat 155:
- `We shall certainly test you by afflicting you with 
  1. `fear,` 
  2. `hunger,` 
  3. `loss of properties and` 
  4. `lives and` 
  5. `fruits.` 
- `Give glad tidings, then, to those who remain patient;`

Since Fear is at the top does this mean it is the most frequent test or the hardest one?
I think it could mean that we have a 'fear' of all of the underlying things mentioned in Ayah like fear of hunger, fear of loss of properties and lives and fruits.
One more thing, if hunger is mentioned, why are fruits mentioned?

Ayat 156:
- `those who when any affliction smites them, they say:`
- **`“Verily, we belong to Allah, and it is to Him that we are destined to return.”`**
- **``قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّآ إِلَيْهِ رَٰجِعُونَ``**
- I remember, upon the confirmation of death of Ammi, my brother (Ammad) recited this with pure heart! (Note: I do not remember at all if I recited this)

Ayat 157:
- `Upon them will be the blessings and mercy of their Lord,` 
- `and it is they who are rightly guided.`
- Subhan Allah!


Ayat 158:
- `Surely, al-Safa and al-Marwah are the symbols of Allah. `
- `Hence, whoever performs Hajj (Full Pilgrimage) to the House (of Allah) or `
- `makes 'Umrah (Minor Pilgrimage),` 
- `will find that it is no sin for him to ambulate between the two.`
- `And whoever does a good work voluntarily should know that Allah is Appreciative, All-Knowing.`


Ayat 159:
- `Those who conceal`
- `anything of the clear teachings and` 
- `true guidance` 
- `which We have sent down even though We have made them clear in Our Book,` 
- `Allah curses such people and so do all the cursers,`


I think, This could be directed towards us, once we learn the Quran and the Deen, we must not hide anything for whatever the reason, be it ego or any other worldly benefit.


Ayat 160:
- `except those who `
  1. `repent and `
  2. `make amends and `
  3. `openly declare (what they had concealed). `
- `Such shall I pardon for I am Much- Relenting, Most Compassionate.`
- I think, this is provided as a forgiveness for those who have comitted this sin mentioned in previous Ayah but the conditions are mentioned to gain the forgiveness from "At-Tawwab" "Ar-Raheem"

Ayat 161
- `As for those who disbelieved`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **The original meaning of kufr is to conceal.**
    - This lent the word a nuance of denial and it began to be used as an antonym of iman.
    - **Iman means to believe, to accept, and to recognize.**
    - **Kufr, on the contrary, denotes refusal to believe, to deny, to reject.**
    - According to the Qur'an 
    - there are several possible forms of disbelief. 
      - One is to refuse either to believe in the existence of God,  to acknowledge His sovereignty, to recognize Him as the only Lord of the Universe and of mankind or to recognize Him as the only Lord and the only object of worship and adoration. 
      - The second form of disbelief is when a man recognizes the existence of God but still refuses to accept His ordinances and directives as the only source of true guidance, and as the true law for his life. 
      - The third form of disbelief is when even though a man recognizes in principle that he ought to follow the guidance of God he refuses to believe in the Prophets who were the means of communicating God's guidance to man. 
      - The fourth form of disbelief is to differentiate between one Prophet and another and, out of parochialism and bigotry, to accept some Prophets and reject others. 
      - The fifth form of disbelief is the refusal to recognize, either totally or partially, the teachings communicated by the Prophets, on God's behalf, concerning the beliefs, the principles of morality, and the laws for fashioning human life. 
      - The sixth form of disbelief is where a person theoretically accepts all that he should accept but wilfully disobeys God's ordinances and persists in this disobedience, and considers disobedience rather than obedience to God to be the true principle of life. 
    - All these modes of thought and action are forms of rebellion towards God and the Qur'an characterizes each of them as kufr. 
    - In addition, the term **kufr** is used at several places in the Qur'an in the sense of ingratitude and in this usage it signifies the **exact opposite of shukr (gratitude)**.
      -  Gratefulness consists in feeling thankful to one's benefactor, in duly recognizing the value of his benevolence, in making use of it in a manner pleasing to its bestower, and in being utterly loyal to him. 
      -  Ingratitude denotes, on the contrary, that the man concerned has either failed to recognize the bounty of his benefactor, or considers it to be either the outcome of his own power and ability or else that of some other person's favour or intercession.    
      - Another form of ingratitude consists in failing to recognize fully the worth of the bounty received and in either allowing it to be wasted or to be used in contravention of the will of the benefactor; this ingratitude includes infidelity and treachery towards the benefactor in disregard of his benevolence and kindness. This kind of kufr is known in ordinary language as ungratefulness.
- `and died disbelieving,`
- `surely the curse of` 
1. `Allah and of the `
2. `angels and of `
3. `all men` 
- `is on them.`


Ayat 162:
- `Thus shall they abide and their `**`chastisement shall not be lightened`**`, nor shall they be given respite.`


Ayat 163:
- **`Your God is One God,`**
- **`there is no god but He;`**
- **`the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate`**`
