**Ayat 104 - 112**
# Ruku 13

## Overview

Ayat 104:

- `O you who believe! `
  - This is directed towards believers.
- `Do not say (to the Prophet): Ra'ina (Lend ear to us), `
  - In tafsir, it is found that 'Ra'ina' is a dual meaning word in Arabic and Hebrew and jew played a little game with Muslims.
- `but say Unzurna (Favour us with your attention) `
  - Allah guided Muslims.
- `and pay heed (to him).`
  - I think, this is for us, we must properly listen whenever a topic of Holy Prophet PBUH is being discussed in a gathering.
- `A painful chastisement awaits the unbelievers.`

I believe, this could relates to us in a way that in our conversations, we sometimes use double meaning words 'just' for the sake of fun, so that w could make others laugh for mere seconds.. But we shoudln't do so.
Note: This could also relate to that Ayah where Bani Israel were prohibited to work on Saturday but they tried to play some tricks to do so and then the Azaab went down on them and they were made apes.

Ayat 105:

- `The unbelievers, `
   1. `be they the People of the Book or `
   2. `those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity, `
- `do not wish that any good should be sent down upon you from your Lord. `
- `But Allah chooses for His mercy whomsoever He wills. `
- `Allah is Lord of Abounding Bounty.`


Ayat 106:
- `For whatever verse We might 
  - 1. `abrogate or `
  - 2. `consign to oblivion,` 
- `We bring 
  - 1. `a better one or` 
  - 2. `the like of it.` 
- `Are you not aware that Allah is All-Powerful?`


Subhan Allah... What a wonderful reference..
Whatever has been abrogated, is replaced with better one.
Whatever has been forgotten, is revised.
Superb!

Maarif-ul-Quran:
- At first, Muslims used to pray with their faces turned towards the Baytul-Maqdis بیت المقدس at Jerusalem; 
- later on, Allah commanded them to turn towards the Ka'bah کعبہ . 
- Similarly, certain other injunctions were abrogated altogether, or replaced by others. 
- This provided the Jews and some of the associators too with an occasion to taunt the Muslims, 
- and to say that such changes were made by the Holy Prophet ﷺ himself and not by Allah. 
- Their purpose was to sow the seed of doubt in the mind of the Muslims with regard to the Holy Qur'an being a book revealed by Allah. 
- They used to argue that if everything that Allah revealed was good, as the Muslims affirmed, why should one injunction be re-placed by another? 
  - For, it would only mean that one of the two injunctions must be good, and the other evil, but no divine revelation can possibly be evil. 
  - Putting these two premises together, the Jews tried to draw the conclusion that the Holy Qur'an could not be a revealed book.

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- This is in response to a doubt which the Jews tried to implant in the minds of the Muslims. 
- If both the earlier Scriptures and the Qur'an were revelations from God, why was it - they asked - that the injunctions found in the earlier Scriptures had been replaced by new ones in the Qur'an?
-  How could the same God issue divergent injunctions? Furthermore, they expressed their amazement at the Qur'anic indictment of the Jews and Christians for having allowed part of the revelation to be forgotten and lost, pointing out that it was impossible that Divine revelation should be erased from human memory. 
-  In all this, their motive was not to know the truth but to cast doubt on the Divine origin of the Qur'an. 
-  In refutation God states that He being the Absolute Sovereign has unlimited authority both to abrogate previous injunctions and to cause people to forget the injunctions He wants them to forget. 
-  However, God ensures that whatever He abrogates or causes to be erased from people's memories is replaced by something equally or even more beneficial


Ayat 107:
- `Are you not aware that the dominion of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah, `
- `and that none apart from Allah is your protector or helper?`



Ayat 108:
- `Or would you ask your Messenger in the manner Moses was asked before? `
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Jews, who were addicted to hair-splitting arguments, instigated the Muslims to ask the Prophet a great many questions.
    - God, therefore, cautioned the Muslims against following the example of the Jews in this matter, and admonished them against unnecessary inquisitiveness. 
    - **The Prophet (PBUH) himself often warned the Muslims that excessive inquisitiveness (which was devoid of religious earnestness and the sincere desire to do God's will) had been the ruin of earlier religious communities. (Muslim, 'Fadail', 130; Bukhari, '1'tisim', 2 - Ed.)** 
    - He stressed that people need not delve too deeply into questions left unelucidated by God or His Messenger. 
    - It was better to follow the injunctions which were clearly laid down, abstain from things prohibited, and avoid excessive inquiry about far-fetched, hypothetical issues, attending instead to questions of practical significance.
  - Maarif-ul-Quran:
    - Hostility to the Holy Prophet ﷺ had become so habitual to the Jews that they were always making insolent demands. 
    - Once they asked him to bring before them whole of the Qur'an all at once just as the Torah had been revealed.
- `And whoever exchanges faith for unbelief has surely strayed from the Right Way.`
  - Does this mean that people who demand such things from Holy Prophet PBUG are exachanging fath for unbelief?


Ayat 109:
- `Out of sheer envy many People of the Book would be glad to turn you back into unbelievers after you have become believers even though the Truth has become clear to them. `
  - Does this mean that once we start researching on our own, other people "of the book", out of envy and with their knowledge are going to throw us back to those pits of darkness again?
- `Nevertheless, forgive and be indulgent`
  - In such cases, forgive and overlook such people and their discussions!
- `towards them until Allah brings forth His decision.`
  - Wait for Allah's decisions.
-  `Surely Allah is All-Powerful.`
   -  Since He is the Most Powerful!


Ayat 110:
- `Establish Prayer and dispense Zakah. `
  - These two words are mostly find with one another.
  - One more general question that came to my mind, why aren't the instructions for spending "Ilm" Knowledge has been made? Why only the cash? Even though both are the types of blessings from Allah SWT but the Zakah is just for the "Maal". I will try to find answers to this but first I have to understand if it is an appropriate question to ponder over or not.
- `Whatever good deeds you send forth for your own good, `
  - Whatever good we do, it is for us, not for anyone else.
- `you will find them with Allah. `
  - Still, whatever good we do for us, is safe and secure with Allah SWT. No one can provide better safety than Allah.
- `Surely Allah sees all that you do.`
  - Allah sees what we do and how sincere are we with our Prayers and Zakat.


Ayat 111:
- `They say: “None shall enter the Garden unless he be a Jew or (according to the Christians), a Christian.” `
- `These are their vain desires. `
- `Say: “Bring your proof if you are speaking the truth.”`
- This is directed towards Jews and Christians! There's no proof that they are the ones going to Jannah. Just their desires, no actions to back the statement up!


Ayat 112:
- `None has any special claim upon reward from Allah.) `
- `Whoever `
  - 1. `submits himself completely to the obedience of Allah and `
  - 2. `does good `
- `will find his reward with his Lord. `
  - This has been mentioned twice, in the Ayah 110 and here again.
  - The repition could mean that we MUST believe that whatever we do, whenever we sacrifice our time, cash, skill, knowledge, ego or anything else for the sake of Allah, for they are the hardest things to sacrifice, we are definitely going to find them with Allah in a completely protected manner.
    - Could this Ayah and the one before that be a source of algorithm for AI based algorithms in 'reinforcement learning' and towards InfoSec? I can try to make a link towards that.
      - In general terms, reinforcement learning works in a manner of reward for doing good? What if we incorporate such a thing where we 'make' the bot believe that 'reward' is 'protected' and look at the performanceo of traditional bot with this bot? This could relate to a difference in their behavior and we could correlate the same behaviour in Muslims and Munafiq!
- `No fear shall come upon them, nor shall they grieve.`
  - Those who believe that the 'reward' is with Allah and it is protected, how can they have fear? how can they grieve? This is exactly the lesson learned from the book of Tawakkul that I studied last month. The whole game is of belief!
