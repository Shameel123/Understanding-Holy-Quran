**Ayat 148 - 151**
# Ruku 18

## Overview


Ayat 148:


- `Everyone has a direction towards which he turns;`
- `so excel one another in good works.`
- This is one of the most beautiful Ayah to encourage us to invest more and more time and energy towards Deen!
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There is a subtle gap between this sentence and the next, 
  - a gap which the reader can fill with just a little reflection. 
  - The idea conveyed here is that anyone who prays will, after all, have to turn his face in some direction. 
  - But what is of real significance is not the turning of one's face in some specific direction but one's orientation to righteousness for the sake of which one performs the ritual Prayer. 
  - A man's real concern should be moral excellence rather than controversies regarding such formal regulations as the direction of Prayer.
- `Allah will bring you all together wherever you might be,`
- `for nothing is beyond His power.`



Ayat 149:
- `From wheresoever you might come forth turn your face towards the Holy Mosque;` 
- `for that indeed is the Truth from your Lord, `
- `and Allah is not heedless of what you do.`


Ayat 150:
- `From wheresoever you come forth turn your faces towards the Holy Mosque,`
- `and wheresoever you may be, turn your faces towards it in Prayer so that none may have an argument against you`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The followers of the Prophet (peace be upon him) were asked to follow the order to turn towards the Ka'bah, and to do so strictly, since any lapse in this matter on their part would give their opponents a weapon to use against them in their polemics. They would be able to hold Muslims up to ridicule on the grounds that they had violated what they themselves claimed to be from their Lord.
- `unless they be those immersed in wrong-doing.`
- `Do not fear them, but fear only Me so that I may complete My favour upon you;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The 'favour' here refers to the position of world leadership and guidance from which God removed the children of israel and which was the conferred upon this ummah. 
    - The highest reward that can be granted to a people in recognition of its righteousness is its designation, by God's command, to the leadership of the world in order to guide the entire human race to godliness and righteousness.
    - What is said here, therefore, is that the command to change the qiblah was a sign of installation of the Muslims to leadership. 
    - Hence, the Muslims should follow the directives of God if for no other reason than that ingratitude and disobedience might deprive them of the honour that had been bestowed upon them.

- `perhaps you will be guided to the Right Way.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Perhaps you will be guided to the right way' is indicative here of the regal appropriate for God's address to His creatures. The indication from a soverign, while addressing his slave, that the latter could expect some favour from him is quite enough to make that slave rejoice and celebrate.


 Ayat 151:
 - `Just as when We sent among you a Messenger of yourselves, `
 1. `who recites to you Our Signs, `
 2. `purifies your lives, `
 3. `instructs you in the Book` 
 4. `and in Wisdom, `
 5. `and instructs you what you did not know.`


I think, one of the lessons, we can learn from the changing of Qiblah is that whenever we recieve a knwoledge as a blessing from Allah SWT to turn away from bad ways towards straight path, we must IMMEDIATELY move towards it...

- Maarif-ul-Quran:
- These verses conclude the discussion on the theme of the Qiblah قبلہ or religious orientation. 
- So, Verse 151 repeats the second part of the prayer of Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) with which the discussion had begun (Verses 127 - 129). 
- He had, as one would recall, prayed Allah to accept his founding of the Ka'bah کعبہ ، and to send among his progeny a Messenger from among themselves. 
- The subsequent discussion on the subject of the Qiblah قبلہ has already shown that the first prayer has been heard and accepted. 
- Now, Verse 151 declares that similarly the second request has also been granted, suggesting that since the Holy Prophet ﷺ has been sent in answer to the prayer of the founder of the Ka'bah کعبہ ، 
- it is no wonder that it should be appointed as his Qiblah قبلہ . 
- Verse 151 has specifically mentioned that the new Prophet (Muhammad ﷺ) is sent with the same attributes as specified by Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) in his prayer, namely: 
  - (1) He recites to them the verses of the Qur'an; 
  - (2) He teaches them the Book and the wisdom; 
  - (3) He purifies them; 
  - (4) He teaches them things which his listeners did not know of, nor could they be found in the earlier Divine Books or through individual reason.
