**Ayat 72 - 82**
# Ruku 8

## Overview
Story of Israelites is also mentioned in this Ruku.

Ayat 72:
- Allah madde them remember about the incident when they killed a man and started blaming one another.
- "Allah was determined to bring to light what you were hiding."
- Maarif-ul-Quran:
  - This is the beginning of the story which has been related earlier in Verses 67-71.
  - Verse 72 relates how a man was murdered, and how people started accusing each other. 
  -  This chronological order has not been preserved in the narration, but inverted, and **this re-arrangement has a subtle significance**.
  -  The present story is meant to show two misdeeds: 
     1.   Comitting a murder and then trying to hide it.
     2.   Raising uncalled-for objections to divine commandments.
   - If the chronological order had been kept up, the readers would have supposed that it was only the first of these that was really intended, while the second was added only by way of completing the story. The present arrangement clearly shows that both the misdeeds have been equally emphasized.
  
  Further Description from Maarif-ul-Quran:
  - The murderer had his supporters who wanted to hide his crime, and hence began accusing different people. 
  - But Allah willed that the criminal should be brought to book, and appointed a miraculous way of identifying him.
  - Dead body of the murdered man should be touched with a part of the flesh of the sacrificial cow. 
  - When this was done, the dead man came back to life, announced the name of his murderer, and died again.
  - Let us say a word about the arrangement and sequence of the events. 


Ayat 73:
- Allah ordered: “Smite the corpse with a part of it.”
- This is how Allah shows His Signs.
- These are the Signs for Intellectuals so that we "MAY" focus.


Ayat 74:
- I believe this is one of the **STRONGEST** Ayah that I have felt during the studies of these narations and stories.
- I believe it links to the previous Ayah where Allah mentions about using intellect لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ. 
- What the Ayah mentions:
  - *Then*
  - "Your hearts hardened and became like stones or even harder."
     1. "Some stones from which streams burst forth."
     2. "Some that split asunder and water issues out."
     3. "Some that crash down for fear of Allah."
  -  **وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَـٰفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ**
  -  **"Allah is not heedless of the things you do."**
 
 Ayat 75:
 - This Ayah is directed towards Jews.
   - "Do you hope that these people will believe in the Message you are preaching,"
   - "even though a party of them has been wont to listen to the Word of Allah"
   - "and after they had fully grasped it, knowingly distorted it?"
 - I believe this can also be directed towards the "scholars" of this Ummah rather than the Jew Scholars of the past as today we see that these scholars "knowingly" provide misunderstood interpretation of Ayah of Holy Quran to others.


Ayat 76:
- I think this makes a link with 2:13 and mentions Munafiq.
- Ayah:
  - And when they meet those who believe (in Muhammad) they say:
  - “We too believe in him.”
  - But in their intimate meetings they say to one another:
  - “How foolish! Why should you intimate to them what Allah has revealed to you, for they will use it as argument against you before your Lord?”


Ayat 77:
- Allah knows what they declare and what they hide.

Ayat 78:
- I think this is about those people who do not have the knowledge of Quran and the rules that Mulim must adhere to.
- These people follow their own wishes and try to justify them.
- When starting "Tahfim-ul-Quran", it was written in starting pages that if you open Quran to justify your own needs, you are going to twist the meaning on different occasions and keeping things out of the context, thus directly linking Ayat 76 with this where it's mentioned that people distorts the instructions,
- I now believe that, in this way, Ayat 76 is not "just" directed towards "Unjust Scholars" but towards people like us who are going to pretend on our own intellect to justify our own needs by twisting the meaning of Quran which in itself is a grave sin and Allah is well aware of it.
- We cannot play games with these instructions of Holy Quran, as we have already been warned in Ayat 66 which links to Ayat 65 of the incident of Apes.
- Ayah:
  - "Among them are also the unlettered folk who do not know about the Scriptures"
  - "but cherish baseless wishes and merely follow their conjectures."

Ayat 79:
- "Woe, then, to those who write out the Scriptures with their own hands"
- "and then, in order to make a trifling gain, claim: “This is from Allah.”"
- "Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they thus earn."
- "Woe" فَوَيْلٌۭ has been used twice...  This means, it is one of the MOST MISERABLE thing a person can do to himself for it brings utter destruction upon oneself.


Ayat 80:
- They say: “The Fire will certainly not touch us except for a limited number of days.”
  - This was directed towards Jews who believed they were immune.
  - These days, I have seen people saying "among Muslims" that they will remain some days in Hell and then they will be shifted to Paradise.
- "Say (to them):"
  - “Have you received a promise from Allah – for Allah never breaks His promise”
  - “or do you attribute to Allah something about which you have no knowledge?”

Ayah 81 mentions about people of Hellأَصْحَـٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ ۖ, Ayah 82 mentions about people of Paradise  أَصْحَـٰبُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ ۖ

Ayat 81:
- The ayah mentions two traits for which the people will ALWAYS remain in HellFire.
-  Earning Evil - مَن كَسَبَ سَيِّئَةًۭ
-  Surrounding it with Sins/Mistakes - وَأَحَـٰطَتْ بِهِۦ خَطِيٓـَٔتُهُۥ


Ayat 82:
- The ayah also mentiones two traits for which the people will ALWAYS remain in Paradise
- Those who believe وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟
- Those who do good deeds وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ


Subhan Allah, how the above two Ayah are mirror copy of one another where both serve same purpose, to bring us closer to Allah SWT.
