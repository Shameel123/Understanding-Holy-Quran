- `“You shall serve none but Allah`
- ```and do good to```
  1. ```Parents```

  4. ```Needy```
- `You shall speak kindly to people`
- `Establish Prayer`
- `Give Zakah`
- `Except for a few of you,`
  - `You turned back on this covenant`
  - `and you are still backsliders`
- The ayat contains general yet most powerful features one should possess to become a decent human being.

Ayat 84:
- `And recall when We made a covenant with you, that `
- `you shall not shed one another’s blood,`
- `and shall not turn out one another from your homelands;`
- `you confirmed it, and you yourselves are witnesses to it.`


Ayat 85:
- This ayat is in continuation for previous Ayah
- `And here you are, killing one another, turning out a party of your own from their homelands,`
- `aiding one another against them in sin and enmity,`
- `and if they come to you as captives you ransom them although the very act of expelling them was unlawful to you.`
- **```Do you believe in a part of the Scripture and reject the rest?```**
- `What else, then, could be the retribution of those among you who do this than that they should live in degradation in the present life, and that on the Day of Resurrection they should be sent to the severest chastisement?`
- This sin, of believing part of revealation and skipping the rest will destroy this life and the next.
- `Allah is not heedless of what you do.` 
- This has been occured twice now.

Maarif-ul-Quran:
- This verse recounts how the Israelites broke the pledge they had willingly made. Allah had laid down three special injunctions for the Israelites: 
1.  They should not kill one another in an internecine war. 
2. They should not force their own people into exile. 
3. If they found a man from amongst them a prisoner of war, they should pay a ransom, and get him released. 
- The Israelites disregarded the first two injunctions, and acted upon the third alone which they supposed easier to be carried out.

It happened like this:
- There lived in Madinah two tribes, the Aws اوس and the Khazraj خزرج ، 
- They were hostile to each other, and would often go to war.
-  In the environs of Madinah, there also lived two tribes of the Jews, the Bani Qurayzah بنی قریظہ and the Bani Nadir. 
-  The former had friendly relations with the Aws اوس ، and the latter with the Khazraj خزرج . 
-  When the Aws اوس and the Khazraj خزرج went to war against each other, the two tribes of the Jews also took part in the battle, each on the side of its own friends. 
-  In these battles, many Jews lost their lives or were rendered homeless as much as the non-Jews. 
-  In other words, the Jews of the Bani Qurayzah بنی قریظہ tribe had a share in the slaughter and exile of the Jews of the Bani Nadir tribe, and vice versa. 
-  However, when some of the Jews became prisoners of war, each of the two Jewish groups would persuade their respective friends among the non-Jews to accept a ransom and to release the prisoners. 
-  When they were asked why they showed such a solicitude for the prisoners, they would say that it was obligatory for them to get prisoners released. B
-  ut when someone objected to their helping the non-Jews in slaughtering the Jews, they used to reply that it would be a real disgrace if they did not go to the aid of their friends, even if they were not Jews.


Ayat 86:
`These are the ones who have bought the present life in exchange for the World to Come.`
`Their chastisement shall not be lightened, nor shall they be helped.`
