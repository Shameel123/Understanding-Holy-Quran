**Ayat 62 - 71**
# Ruku 8

## Overview


Ayat 62:
- The Ayah mentions following nations:
  - Those who believe (Muslims)
  - Jews
  - Christians
  - Sabians (It's a mystery about who this nation is)
- Afermentioned nations/people will be rewarded if:
  - They believe in Allah.
  - They believe in Hereafter.
- Question: Does this mean that Jews, Christians and Sabians will also be allowed to go to Jannah if they:
    - Believe in Allah SWT.
    - Believe in Last Day.
    - Do righteous deeds.
- Answer:
     - It is given in Maarif-ul-Quran as quoted below:
     - The verse mentions only two articles of faith of the Islamic creed -- faith in Allah and faith in the Day of Judgment. This should not be taken to mean that in order to attain salvation it is enough to have faith only in Allah and in the Day of Judgment. For, the Holy Qur'an repeatedly declares that he who does not believe in the prophets, in angels and in the Books of Allah is not a Muslim. Faith in Allah is the first article in the Islamic creed, while faith in the Day of Judgment is the last. By mentioning only these two, the verse intends to say in a succinct manner that it is necessary to have faith in all the articles of the creed, from the first to the last. Moreover, it is through the prophets and the Books of Allah alone that man can acquire any knowledge of the essence and the attributes of Allah and of what is to happen on the Day of Judgment, while the Books of Allah are revealed to the prophets through an angel. So, it is not possible to have faith in Allah and the Day of Judgment until and unless one has faith in the angels, in the Books of Allah and in the prophets.
   - Note: I have now noticed that Holy Quran mentions "أَجْرُهُمْ" which means "reward", this does not necessarliy mean "Jannah". This could mean that they are going to get 'wordly' reward or maybe their punishment gets decreased in the form of reward or maybe they are saved from Jahannum as a reward but cannot go in Jannat either. These are all my own assumptions and understanding from the Ayah.
