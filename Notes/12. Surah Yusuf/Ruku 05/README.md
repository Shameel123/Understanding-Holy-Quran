**Ayat 36 - 42**

## Ayat 36

- `And with Joseph`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - At the time when Prophet Joseph was sent to prison, he probably was about twenty years old. This has been inferred from two statements in the Quran and the Talmud. 
    - The Quran (Ayat 42) says that....he remained in the prison for a decade or so and the Talmud says that ...Joseph was thirty years old when he was elevated to his honorable and trustworthy position.
- `two other slaves entered the prison.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - One of the two prisoners, according to the Bible, was the chief of the butlers of the king of Egypt, and the other the chief of the bakers.
    - And according to the Talmud, they were condemned to the prison because during a feast stone grits were found in the bread and a fly in the wine.
- `One of them said:`
  - `"I saw myself pressing wine in a dream";`
- `and the other said:`
  - `"I saw myself carrying bread on my head of which the birds were eating."`
- `Both said:`
  - `"Tell us what is its interpretation; for we consider you to be one of those who do good."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The fact that two prisoners attested his righteousness shows that Prophet Joseph was held in high esteem in the prison.
      - Otherwise there was no reason why the two should have requested him alone to interpret the dreams and paid their homage like this:
        - We have seen that you are a righteous man.
      - It clearly means that the events narrated in the preceding verses had reached all and sundry and the people, inside the prison and outside it, knew that he had not been guilty of any crime or sin.
      - On the other hand, he had proved himself to be a noble soul who had come out successful in the hardest test of his piety.
      - So much so that there was not the like of him in piety, not even among their own religious leaders in the whole country.
      - That is why not only the prisoners but also the officers and officials of the prison looked upon him as an honorable man and had full confidence in him.
      - The Bible confirms this: And the keeper of the prison committed to Josephâ€™s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. The keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand. (Gen. 39: 22-23).

## Ayat 37

- `Joseph said:`
  - `"I will inform you about the interpretation of the dreams before the arrival of the food that is sent to you.`
  - `This knowledge is part of what I have been taught by my Lord.`
  - `I have renounced the way of those who do not believe in Allah, and who deny the Hereafter,`

## Ayat 38

- `and I have adopted the way of my forefathers - Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.`
- `It is not for us to associate any with Allah in His Divinity.`
- `It is out of Allah's grace upon us and upon mankind (that He did not require of us to serve any other than Allah), and yet most people do not give thanks.`

## Ayat 39

- `Fellow-prisoners!`
- `Is it better that there be diverse lords, or just Allah, the One, the Irresistible?`

## Ayat 40

- `Those whom you serve beside Him are merely idle names that you and your fathers have fabricated, without Allah sending down any sanction for them.`
- `All authority to govern rests only with Allah.`
- `He has commanded that you serve none but Him.`
- `This is the Right Way of life, though most people are altogether unaware.`

## Ayat 41

- `Fellow-prisoners!`
- `(This is the interpretation of your dreams):`
- `one of you will serve wine to his lord (the king of Egypt).`
- `As for the other, he will be crucified and birds will eat of his head.`
- `The question concerning what you asked has thus been decided."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This discourse, which is the soul of this story, and is one of the best on the doctrine of Tauhid in the Quran itself, finds no place at all in the Bible and the Talmud.
  - This is because they regard him merely as a wise and pious man and not as a Prophet. That is why Rev. Rodwell has, in regard to this passage, accused Muhammad (peace be upon him) of putting his own doctrine and conviction into the mouth of Joseph (peace be upon him).
  - But the Quran not only puts forward and presents these two aspects of his life in a much better and clearer way but also presents him as a Prophet, who had started propagating the message even in the prison.

## Ayat 42

- `And Joseph said to the one of the two prisoners who he knew would be set free:`
  - `"Mention me in your lord's presence."`
- `But Satan caused him to forget mentioning this to his lord (the ruler of Egypt) and so Joseph languished in prison for several years.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Some commentators have interpreted it like this:
    - Satan made Prophet Joseph neglectful of his Lord, Allah, so he placed his confidence in a man rather than Allah and desired him to mention him to his lord, the king, for his release. So Allah punished him by letting him languish several years in the dungeon.
  - In fact, such an interpretation is absolutely erroneous for as Allamah Ibn Kathir and some early commentators like Mujahid, Muhammad-bin- Ishaq and some others say, the pronoun him refers to that person who he thought would be released. Therefore it will mean:
    - Satan made him (the would be free man) so neglectful that he forgot to mention him (Prophet Joseph) to his lord (the king). They also cite a tradition in support of their interpretation to this effect.
    - The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: **If Prophet Joseph had not said that what he said, he would not have remained in imprisonment for several years.**
    - But Allamah Ibn Kathir says: **This Hadith cannot be accepted because all the ways in which it has been reported are weak**.
    - Moreover, two of the reporters, Sufyan-bin-Wakii and Ibrahim-bin-Yazid, are not trustworthy. Besides being weak on technical grounds, it is also against the dictates of common sense: if a wronged person adopted some measures for his release, he cannot be considered to be neglectful of God and guilty of the lack of trust in Allah.
