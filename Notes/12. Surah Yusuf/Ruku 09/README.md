**Ayat 69 - 79**

## Ayat 69

- `When they presented themselves before Joseph, he took his brother aside to himself and said:`
  - `"Verily I am your own brother Joseph;`
  - `so do not grieve over the manner they have treated you."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The entire story of their reunion after a separation of twenty years or so has been summed up in this brief sentence.
  - In all probability Prophet Joseph might have told him the story of the vicissitudes that ultimately had led to his high rank, and Benjamin in his turn might have related the story of the ill treatment of the heartless step brothers.
  - Then Prophet Joseph might have reassured him that he would not be allowed to go back with them but remain with him. It is also possible that the plan to retain him there, without disclosing the secret of Prophet Joseph’s identity, would have then been thought out and decided upon.

## Ayat 70

- `Then, while Joseph was having their provisions loaded, he put his drinking-cup in his brother's saddlebag.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In all probability, Prophet Joseph put the cup in his brother’s pack with his knowledge and consent, as may be inferred from the preceding verse.
    - Obviously, Prophet Joseph desired to free his brother from the oppression of the cruel step brothers and he himself was reluctant to go back with them.
    - But this could not be done directly and openly without disclosing his own identity, which was not then expedient under the circumstances.
    - Therefore both the brothers might have thought out this plan, though this would have put the younger brother in an embarrassing situation for the time being because of his involvement in a case of theft. But they had adopted this plan because afterwards both the brothers could clear it easily by disclosing the real matter.
- `And then a herald cried:`
  - `"Travellers, you are thieves."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:  
      - There is nothing in this verse nor in the succeeding verses to show that Prophet Joseph took his servants in his confidence in regard to this matter, and instructed them to bring a false accusation against the travelers.
      - The simple explanation of the incident may be this. The cup might have been quietly and secretly put in the pack. Afterwards when the servants did not find it, they might have come to the inevitable conclusion that it must have been stolen by the travelers who were staying there.

## Ayat 71

- `Turning back they asked:`
  - `"What have you lost?"`

## Ayat 72

- `The officials said:`
  - `"We have lost the king's cup."`
- `(And their chief added):`
  - `"He who brings it shall have a camel-load of provisions, I guarantee that."`

## Ayat 73

- `They said:`
  - `"By Allah, you certainly know that we did not come to act corruptly in this land, nor are we those who steal."`

## Ayat 74

- `The officials said:`
  - `"If you are lying, what will be the penalty for him who has stolen?"`

## Ayat 75

- `They replied:`
  - `"He in whose saddlebag the cup is found, he himself shall be its recompense."`
- `Thus do we punish the wrong-doers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It should be kept in mind that these people were the descendants of Prophet Abraham. 
  - Therefore they put forward his law regarding a thief, that is, the thief should be made the bondsman of the one whose goods he had stolen.

## Ayat 76 

- `Then Joseph began searching their bags before searching his own brother's bag.`
- `Then he brought forth the drinking-cup from his brother's bag.`
- `Thus did We contrive to support Joseph.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Now let us consider the question: How did Allah directly support Prophet Joseph with His plan?
    - It is obvious that the plan of placing the cup in Benjamin’s pack was thought out and executed by Joseph himself.
    - And it is also obvious that the royal servants checked their packs as a matter of routine for such is the procedure that is generally followed on such occasions.
    - There is nothing in this passage that might be called supernatural support by Allah except that the servants asked the brothers to prescribe the punishment for the thief, and they answered that he should be made a bondsman. The sentence that follows also confirms this interpretation.
- `He had no right, according to the religion of the king (i.e. the law of Egypt), to take his brother, unless Allah so willed.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Had Allah willed it, He would not have removed the flaw in the plan of Prophet Joseph.
    - It was this: he could seize his brother according to his plan only by the help of the king’s law, but it was not worthy of a Prophet of Allah to apply that un-Islamic law to his own personal case. For he had taken political power in his hands in order to establish gradually the Islamic law and not to enforce and keep the king’s law in vogue.
    - Had Allah willed it, He would have left no other course for His Prophet except to have resort to the un-Islamic law. But He did not will it so because He did not like to tarnish the fair name of His Prophet.
    - Therefore he made the servants inquire from the brothers (an unusual thing) about the punishment of a thief and they stated the law of Prophet Abraham.
    - Thus not only was the flaw removed, but also no room was left for the brothers to raise any objection against this on the plea that they were not Egyptians, and therefore the law of the land could not be applied against them.
    - As has already been pointed out, this was the support of Allah to which He has referred in the two subsequent verses as a token of His favor and a sign of the perfection of His knowledge.
- `We exalt whomsoever We will over others by several degrees.`
- `And above all those who know is the One Who truly knows.`

## Ayat 77

- `They said:`
  - `"No wonder that he steals for a brother of his stole before."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - As regards to the question why it was not worthy of Prophet Joseph to apply the king’s law to his personal case, its best answer is again found in the practice of the Prophet (peace be upon him).
      - During the interim period, when the laws of ignorance had not yet been replaced by Islamic laws, other Muslims went on drinking wine and taking interest as before, but the Prophet (peace be upon him) never practiced any of these things.
      - Likewise some un- Islamic laws of marriage, such as taking in marriage of real sisters at one and the same time, were practiced, but the Prophet (peace be upon him) never practiced any such thing.
      - Thus it is clear, that there was a difference between leaving in vogue some un-Islamic laws during the period of the evolution of the Islamic law and practicing the same.
      - Had Prophet Joseph applied the king’s law to his own case, it would have meant that he had lent his seeming sanction to that law. But it is obvious that a Prophet, who is sent to eliminate the ways of ignorance cannot follow these even under the temporary leave that is given to others.
- `But Joseph kept his reaction to himself without disclosing the truth to them. He merely said to himself:`
  - `"You are an evil lot. Allah knows well the truth of the accusation that you are making against me (to my face)."`

## Ayat 78

- `They said:`
  - `"O powerful chief (al-aziz)!`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The use of the title Al-Aziz, ruler of the land, with which they addressed Prophet Joseph has given rise to the confusion that he held the same office as the husband of Zuleikha held before him.
      - Then this misunderstanding let the commentators to the invention of further comments, such as. Al-Aziz had died and Prophet Joseph was appointed in his place, and Zuleikha was rejuvenated by a miracle and was married to him by the king.
      - They have not stopped at this. They have, somehow or other, discovered even the conversation that took place between Prophet Joseph and Zuleikha in the first night of their marriage.
      - In fact, all this is mere fiction, for, as has already been pointed out, the word Al-Aziz was the Arabic translation or equivalent of some Egyptian title, and was not the designation of any particular office. It was merely a title used for the high ones in Egypt like “His Excellency” or “Your Excellency”, etc.
      - As regards to the said marriage, this fiction has been built on the story of Prophet Joseph’s marriage in the Bible and the Talmud. According to these, he was married with Asenath, the daughter of Poti-pherah.
      - As the name of the husband of Zuleikha was Potiphar, the two names got confused together. Accordingly, when the story was handed down from the traditions of the Israelites from one commentator to the other, the name Potiphar got interchanged with Poti-pherah because the two were so like each other in sound. Consequently, the daughter in the story was replaced by wife. Then Potiphar was killed in order to facilitate the marriage. Then the only remaining difficulty, that is, the disparity of their ages, was gotten over with the help of a miracle. She was rejuvenated so completely as to enable her to become the worthy wife of the ruler of the land.
  - `His father is an age-stricken man, (and in order that he may not suffer) seize one of us in his stead.`
  - `We indeed consider you an excellent person."`

## Ayat 79

- `Joseph said:`
  - `"Allah forbid that we should seize any except him with whom we found our good.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The use of the words “with whom we have found our property” instead of the word thief is very significant.
      - Prophet Joseph avoided the use of the word thief for his brother because he was not really a thief. 
      - This is called **touriyah**, that is, to put a cover over a reality or to hide a reality. 
        - **Such a practice is allowed by the Muslim law under certain conditions and with certain limitations.**
        - It may be practiced not to gain any selfish end, but to ward off some evil or to protect and save an oppressed person from some oppressor, provided that no other course might have been left except saying something against the truth or of having a resort to a deceitful device. It is obvious that in such a case, a righteous person will not tell a blunt lie or resort to an open deceit. Instead, he will say something or do something that might not be strictly truthful or strictly right, yet at the same time is not a blunt lie, so that he might hide the reality to ward off the evil. Such a practice is lawful, legally and morally, provided that it is not practiced to gain some personal or selfish ends but to ward off a greater evil with a lesser evil.
      - Accordingly, Prophet Joseph scrupulously fulfilled all the conditions in this case. He placed the cup in the pack of his brother with his consent, but he did not ask his servants to make a search of his pack and accuse him of theft. After this, when the servants brought the brothers before him as suspects, he quietly rose from his seat and began to make a search of their packs. Then afterwards, when the brothers requested that one of them should be taken instead of Benjamin, he answered them back in their own words that he would detain only that person in whose possession the cup was found and none else.
  - `Were we to do so, we would surely be one of the wrong-doers."`
