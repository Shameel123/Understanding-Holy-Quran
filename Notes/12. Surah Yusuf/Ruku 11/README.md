**Ayat 94 - 104**

## Ayat 94

- `And as the caravan set out (from Egypt),`
- `their father said (in Canaan):`
  - `"Indeed I smell the fragrance of Joseph.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This is an instance of the extraordinary powers the Prophets possess. Prophet Jacob perceived in Canaan the smell of Prophet Joseph’s shirt from such a distant place as Egypt as soon as the caravan started on the journey.
      - At the same time it also shows, by contrast, that these powers of the Prophets are not inherent or personal characteristics but are bestowed on them by Allah as and when He wills.
      - That is why Prophet Jacob could not perceive the smell of the clothes of Prophet Joseph as long as Allah did not will it, when he had been living in Egypt.
  - `I say so although you may think that I am doting."`

## Ayat 95

- `They said:`
  - `"Surely you are still in your same old craze."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This remark shows that no member of his family except Prophet Joseph appreciated the true worth of Prophet Jacob. He himself was aware of the low state of their mental and moral condition. And it is one of the ironies of fate that the majority of the great personalities who made history got very little appreciation at home.

## Ayat 96

- `And when the bearer of good news came he threw Joseph's shirt over Jacob's face, whereupon he regained his sight, and said:`
- ` "Did I not tell you that I know from Allah what you do not know?"`

## Ayat 97

- `They said:`
  - `"Father! Pray for the forgiveness of our sins; we were truly guilty."`

## Ayat 98

- `He said:`
  - `"I shall pray to my Lord for your forgiveness, for He, and indeed He alone, is Ever Forgiving, Most Merciful."`

## Ayat 99

- `And when they went to Joseph,1 he took his parents aside and said (to the members of his family):`
  - `"Enter the city now, and if Allah wills, you shall be secure."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It is worthwhile to take notice of the total number of Prophet Jacob’s family members that migrated to Egypt with him, for it is closely connected with the problem that is raised concerning the total number of the Israelites who emigrated from there some five hundred years after this.
  - According to the Bible, the total number of the family members was 70, including Prophet Joseph and his two sons, and excluding those daughters-in-law who did not belong to the family of Prophet Jacob. 
  - But according to the census figures given in Numbers, their number was about two million when they were counted in the wilderness of Sinai in the second year, after they come out of the land of Egypt. 
  - The problem is this: how is it possible that these three score and ten souls of his house had multiplied into two million souls during five hundred years or so?

## Ayat 100

- `And after they had entered the city, Joseph raised his parents to the throne1 beside himself,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - According to the Talmud, “when Joseph learned that his father was upon the way, he gathered together his friends and officers, and soldiers of the realm, attired in rich garments,....and formed a great company to meet Prophet Jacob on the way and escort him to Egypt. Music and gladness filled the land, and all the people, the women and the children, assembled on the house tops to view the magnificent display.” (H. Polano, p. 111).
- `and they (involuntarily) bowed in prostration before him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The interpretation of this verse has given rise to some serious misunderstandings, which are against the very fundamentals of the divine guidance. So much so that some people have gone to the extreme of making it lawful to prostrate before kings and saints as a mark of respect.
    - Others more strict on this point have explained it away, saying, “In the former divine laws, it was unlawful only to prostrate in worship before others than Allah, though it was permissible to prostrate before others if it was done without the intention of worship, but now in the divine law given to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) it has been made absolutely unlawful.
- `Joseph said:`
  - `"Father! This is the fulfilment of the vision I had before - one that My Lord has caused to come true.`
  - `He was kind to me when He rescued me from the prison, and brought you from the desert after Satan had stirred discord between me and my brothers.`
  - `Certainly my Lord is Subtle in the fulfilment of His will;`
  - **`He is All-Knowing, All-Wise.`**

## Ayat 101

- `My Lord!`
- `You have bestowed dominion upon me and have taught me to comprehend the depths of things.`
- `O Creator of heavens and earth!`
- `You are my Guardian in this world and in the Hereafter.`
- `Cause me to die in submission to You, and join me, in the end, with the righteous."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The few sentences that were uttered by Prophet Joseph (peace be upon him) at the happiest occasion of his life help depict the most graceful pattern of the virtues of a true believer.
  - There is the man from the desert, whom his own brothers had, out of jealousy, attempted to kill, now sitting on the throne after passing through many vicissitudes of life.
  - All the members of his family have been forced by famine to come before him for help.
  - The same jealous brothers, who had made an attempt on his life, are now standing before him with downcast heads
  - Had there been a “successful man of the world” in his place, he would have used this opportunity for boasting of his greatness and bragging of his successes, and giving vent to his grievances and hurling malicious taunts at his defeated enemies.
  - In utter contrast to this, the true man of God behaves in a quite different way. Instead of boasting and bragging of his own greatness, he is grateful to his God Who had shown grace to him by raising him to such a high position of power, and for arranging his meeting with his people after such a long period of separation. Instead of giving vent to his grievances against his brothers, making taunts at them for their ill treatment, he does not make even a mention of such things **but puts up a defense for them, saying that it was all due to Satan,** who had stirred up strife between them: nay, he even puts it forward as a blessing in disguise, being one of the mysterious ways of Allah by which He had fulfilled His design of raising him to the throne.
  - After saying these things in a few concise sentences, he at once turns to his Lord in gratitude for bestowing on him kingdom and wisdom, instead of letting him rot in the prison, and prays to Him to keep him as His faithful and obedient servant as long as he was alive, and to join him with the righteous people after his death. What a pure and high pattern of character.

## Ayat 102

- `(O Muhammad), this is part of news from the Unseen that We reveal to you for you were not present with them when Joseph's brothers jointly resolved on a plot.`


## Ayat 103

- `And most of the people, howsoever you might so desire, are not going to believe.`

## Ayat 104

- `You do not seek from them any recompense for your service.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In order to grasp the full significance of the underlying admonition implied in it, we must keep in view the background of the revelation of this story given in the introduction to this Surah. 
    - The Quraish themselves had invited the Prophet (peace be upon him) to a meeting that had been arranged for putting him to a test which was to show whether he was a true Prophet or not. When he arrived there, they put this question to him without any previous notice or intimation: why did the Israelites go to Egypt? In answer to this, the Prophet (peace be upon him) recited this Surah then and there. 
    - As they themselves knew that this was an abrupt question and there had been no preparation for its answer beforehand, it was expected that they would believe in his Prophethood. But they were so obdurate that they did not believe in him even then.
    - As Allah was aware of their intentions, he informed His Messenger beforehand, as if to say: Though you have come out successful in the test, to which they themselves put to you, yet most of them are not going to believe it because they are not sincere in their quest for the truth.
    - That is why they will not believe even now when the revelation of this Surah has proved conclusively that the Quran is not being forged by you but is being sent down by Allah Himself. As their real aim and intention is to reject your message anyhow, they will now invent another excuse for their denial.
- `This is merely an admonition to all mankind.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is not meant to remove any misunderstanding the Prophet (peace be upon him) might have cherished, but is merely an indirect warning to the questioners that Allah knew their intentions well. 
    - This was meant to warn them like this: O obdurate people, this Surah has been placed before you to serve as a mirror for you. You demanded a proof from Our Messenger that he was not forging the Quran: had you been reasonable and sincere people, you would have accepted the truth that has been established according to your own test, but you are obdurate people and are still denying it.
