**Ayat 80 - 93**

## Ayat 80

- `Then, when they had despaired of Joseph they went to a corner and counselled together.`
- `The eldest of them said:`
  - `"Do you not know that your father has taken a solemn promise from you in the name of Allah, and you failed in your duty towards Joseph? So I will not depart from this land until my father permits me, or Allah pronounces His judgement in my favour. He is the best of those who judge."`

## Ayat 81

- `So go back to your father and tell him:`
  - `"Father! Your son has certainly been guilty of stealing. We did not see him stealing but testify according to what we know, and obviously we had no power to keep watch over that what is altogether hidden from us.`

## Ayat 82

- `You may inquire of the dwellers of the city where we were, and of the people of the caravan with whom we travelled. We are altogether truthful in what we say."`

## Ayat 83

- `The father heard the narration and said:`
  - `"(All that is untrue). But your souls have made it easy for you to engage in a heinous act.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, you readily believed that my son, whom I know to be of a noble character, had committed the theft of a cup. You have behaved in his case just as you behaved in the case of his elder brother. You made away with him and then pretended, without any pangs of conscience, that a wolf had devoured him and now, with the same ease, you tell me that the other brother has committed a theft.
  - `So, I will be graciously patient even at this.`
  - `Allah may well bring them all back to me.`
  - `He is All-Knowing, All-Wise."`

## Ayat 84

  - `"O my grief for Joseph!"`
- `His eyes whitened with grief and he was choked up with sorrow trying to suppress his grief.`

  - `"By Allah!`
  - `You will continue to remember Joseph until you will either consume yourself with grief, or will die."`

## Ayat 86

- `On going to Egypt they presented themselves to Joseph and said to him:`
  - `"O chief! We and our family are struck with distress and have brought only a paltry sum. So give us corn in full measure, and give it to us in charity.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, it will be charitable of you if you give us that much grain as we require to fulfill our needs, because the goods we have brought for its barter are of less value than of the grain we require.
