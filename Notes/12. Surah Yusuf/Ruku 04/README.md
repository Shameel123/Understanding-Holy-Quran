**Ayat 30 - 35**

## Ayat 30

- `And some ladies in the city began to say:`
  - `"The chief's wife, violently in love with her houseboy, is out to tempt him.`
  - `We think she is clearly mistaken."`

## Ayat 31

- `Hearing of their sly talk`
- `the chief's wife sent for those ladies,`
- `and arranged for them a banquet,`
- `and got ready couches,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The ancient Egyptians used to place pillows and cushions in such feasts for the guests to recline. And this is confirmed by the archaeological remains in Egypt.
- `and gave each guest a knife.`
- `Then,`
- `while they were cutting and eating the fruit, she signalled Joseph:`
  - `"Come out to them."`
- `When the ladies saw him they were so struck with admiration that they cut their hands, exclaiming:`
  - `"Allah preserve us. This is no mortal human. This is nothing but a noble angel!"`

## Ayat 32

- `She said:`
  - `"So now you see!`
  - `This is the one regarding whom you reproached me.`
  - `Indeed I tried to tempt him to myself but he held back,`
  - `although if he were not to follow my order, he would certainly be imprisoned and humiliated."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This open demonstration of her love and declaration of her immoral designs show that the moral condition of the higher class of the Egyptian society had declined to the lowest ebb.
  - It is quite obvious that the women whom she had invited must have been ladies belonging to the upper most stratum of the society.
  - The very fact that she presented her beloved before them without any hesitation, in order to convince them of his beauty and youth that had urged her to fall in love with him, shows that there was nothing uncommon in this demonstration.
  - Then these ladies did not reproach her but themselves practically demonstrated that, in those circumstances, they themselves would have done the same that she did.
  - Above all, the hostess did not feel that it was immodest to declare openly: No doubt, I sought to seduce him and he succeeded in escaping from me. Yet I am not going to give him up. If he will not do as I bid him, he shall be cast into prison and humbled and disgraced.

## Ayat 33

- `Joseph said:`
  - `"My Lord!`
  - `I prefer imprisonment to what they ask me to do.`
  - `And if You do not avert from me the guile of these women,`
  - `I will succumb to their attraction and lapse into ignorance."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In order to grasp the full significance of this prayer of Prophet Joseph, we should try to form a mental picture of the circumstances in which he was placed at that time.
  - In the light of this passage the picture will be something like this.
  - There is the handsome young man of twenty in the prime of his life, who has brought health and vigor of youth from the desert into Egypt, after passing through the ordeal of forced slavery and exile. Fortune has placed him in the house of one of the highest dignitaries in the capital of the most civilized country of the world at the time. There this handsome young man meets in the prime of life with a strange experience. The lady of the house in which he has to live day and night falls passionately in love with him and begins to tempt and seduce him. Then the fame of his beauty spreads all over the capital and the other ladies of the town also become enamored of him. Now this is the critical position. He is surrounded on all sides by hundreds of beautiful snares that have been spread to entrap and catch him unaware. All sorts of devices are employed to excite his passions and entice him: wherever he goes he encounters sin lying in ambush with all its charms and allurements and waiting for an opportune moment to make a surprise attack upon him. Such are the circumstances that are tempting him with sin, but the pious young man successfully passes through the ordeal, set for him by Satan, with the self control that is praiseworthy indeed. But it is all the more praiseworthy that he does not feel any pride for showing such extraordinary piety in such trying and tempting circumstances.
  - On the other hand, he very humbly invokes his Lord to protect him from those traps of sin, for he is afraid of the common human weaknesses and cries out: My Lord, I am weak. I fear lest these temptations should overpower me, I would rather prefer imprisonment to doing such an evil thing into which they are tempting to ensnare me.

## Ayat 34

- `Thereupon his Lord granted his prayer, and averted their guile from him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Allah warded off their guile from Prophet Joseph by strengthening his character in such a way as to make ineffective all their devices to ensnare him, This also implies that Allah opened the door of prison for him in order to keep him safe from their tricks and temptations.
- `Surely He alone is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.`

## Ayat 35

- `Then it occurred to them to cast Joseph into prison for a while even though they had seen clear signs1 (of Joseph's innocence and of the evil ways of their ladies).`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It occurred to them to imprison Prophet Joseph in order to save face after they had seen clear proofs of his innocence and of the guilt of their own women, for no other alternative was left, in their opinion, to undo the scandal that was spreading fast in the land.
  - But it did not occur to them that in fact his imprisonment was his moral victory and the moral defeat of the rulers and the dignitaries of Egypt.
  - By that time, Prophet Joseph had not remained an unknown person, for all and sundry had heard stories of his beauty and piety, and of the love the ladies had shown towards him.
  - Therefore when those wise courtiers put into practice their plausible device to imprison him in order to reverse the doings of their ladies, the common people must have drawn their own conclusions for they knew Prophet Joseph to be a man of pure, strong and high character.
  - So it was obvious to them that he had committed no crime to merit imprisonment, and that he had been imprisoned because it was an easier way of escape for the chiefs of Egypt than to keep their own ladies under control.
