**Ayat 41 - 64**

## Ayat 41

- `And remember Our servant Job:`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the fourth place in the Quran where the Prophet Job (peace be upon him) has been mentioned.
    - Before this he has been mentioned in`
      - (Surah An-Nisa, Ayat 163); (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayat 84 )and (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 83-84). For the details about him, please see (E.Ns 76 to 79 of Surah Al- Anbiya).
- `when he cried to his Lord:`
  - `“Behold, Satan has afflicted me with much hardship and suffering.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This does not mean that Satan has afflicted me with illness and brought distress upon me, but it means: The affliction of the severities of illness, the loss of property and wealth, and the desertion of the near and dear ones is not so great a torment and trouble for me as the temptation of Satan, who is exploiting my condition to despair me of my Lord and wants that I should turn ungrateful to Him and become desperate and impatient.
    - This meaning of the lamentation of the Prophet Job (peace be upon him) is preferable for two reasons:
      - (1) According to the Quran, Allah has granted Satan only the power of temptation. He has not given him the power to afflict with illness the worshipers of Allah and compel them to deviate from the way of service and obedience by causing them physical ailments.
      - (2) In Surah Al-Anbiya when the Prophet Job (peace be upon him) puts before Allah his complaint about illness and disease, he does not mention Satan at all, but says only: I have been afflicted with the disease and You are most Merciful.

## Ayat 42

- `(We commanded him):`
  - `“Stamp your foot on earth, and here is cool water to wash with and to drink.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, as soon as he stamped his foot on the ground, a spring gushed forth by Allah’s command, drinking from which and washing with which was the remedy of the Prophet Job’s (peace be upon him) disease. Most probably he was suffering from some skin disease. According to the Bible also: Satan smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. (Job, 2: 7).

## Ayat 43

- `And We granted to him his family and also the like of them,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Traditions show that during this illness everyone except his wife had deserted the Prophet Job (peace be upon him); even his children had turned away. To this Allah has alluded, saying: When We granted him health, the whole family returned to him, and then We granted him even more children.
- `as a mercy from Us, and as a reminder to people of understanding,`
  - That is, in it there is a lesson for an intelligent man. Neither should man forget God and become arrogant in good times nor despair of Him in bad times.
  - **Good fortune and misfortune are entirely in the Power of Allah, the One.**
  - If He wills He can change the best times of man into the worst times and the worst into the best. Therefore, a wise person should trust in Him alone in all sorts of circumstances and should pin all his hopes on Him.

## Ayat 44

- `(and We said to him):`
  - `“Take in your hand a bundle of rushes and strike with it,`
  - `and do not break your oath.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - A careful study of these words shows that the Prophet Job (peace be upon him) during illness had been annoyed with somebody (according to traditions, his wife) and sworn to beat him or her by giving so many stripes. When Allah restored him to health and the anger of the illness was gone, he became worried as how to fulfill the oath. For if he carried out the oath, he would be inflicting pain on an innocent person, and if he did not, he would be committing the sin of breaking the oath.
      - Allah took him out of the difficult situation by the command: Take a broom containing as many sticks of straw as the number of the stripes you had sworn to give; then strike the person just once with the broom so as both to fulfill your oath and to avoid giving undue trouble to the person concerned.
- `Indeed We found him steadfast.`
- `How excellent a servant (of Ours) he was.`
- `Indeed he constantly turned (to his Lord).`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Some jurists hold the view that this concession was specially meant for the Prophet Job (peace be upon him), and some others think that other people also can take advantage of it.
  - The first view has been cited by Ibn Asakir from Abdullah bin Abbas and by Abu Bakr al-Jassas from Mujahid, and Imam Malik also held the same view.
  - The second view has been adopted by Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Abu Yusuf, Imam Muhammad, Imam Zufar and Imam Shafei.
    - They say that if a person, for instance, has sworn to give his servant ten stripes, and afterwards combines ten whips and strikes him only once in a way that some part of each whip strikes him, his oath will be fulfilled.

## Ayat 45

- `And remember Our servants �`
- `Abraham, Isaac and Jacob �`
- `they were endowed with great strength and vision.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The actual words in the text mean: Those who possessed the hands and the insights. 
  - The hand, as we have explained above, implies power and capability. To describe these Prophets as “men of great power and insight” means that they were practical men. 
  - They possessed great power to obey Allah and to abstain from sin, and they had made great efforts for raising the Word of Allah in the world.
  - “Insight” does not mean eye-sight but the vision of the heart and mind. They could see and recognize the truth. They did not live like the blind in the world, but they walked the straight path of guidance, in the full light of knowledge, with open eyes. .
  - In these words, there is a subtle allusion to this also that the people who commit evil, and have gone astray, are in fact, deprived of the hands as well as the eyes. He only, who works in the cause of Allah, possesses the hands, and he, who distinguishes between the light of the truth and the darkness of falsehood, only possesses the eyes.
 
 ## Ayat 46

 - `Verily We exalted them in consideration of a sterling quality:`
 - `their remembrance of the Abode of the Hereafter.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the real cause for their success and eminence was that there was nothing of worldliness in their character.
  - All their efforts, mental and physical, were directed towards the Hereafter.
  - They remembered it themselves and urged others also to remember it.
  - **That is why Allah exalted them to such high ranks as have never been attained by those who remained absorbed in earning worldly wealth and prosperity.**
  - In this regard, one should also keep in view the subtle point that Allah here has only used the word ad-dar (that abode, or the real abode) for the Hereafter. This is meant to impress the truth that **this world is no abode for man**, but only a passage and a rest house, which man has to leave in any case. The real abode is the abode of the Hereafter.
  - He who works to adorn that abode is the man of insight and such a one should inevitably be a commendable person in the sight of Allah. As for him who in order to adorn his transitory abode in this rest house behaves in a way as to ruin his real abode in the Hereafter is foolish and naturally cannot be liked by Allah.

## Ayat 47

- `In Our sight they are among the chosen and excellent ones.`

## Ayat 48

- `And remember`
- `Ishmael,`
- `Elisha,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Prophet AlYasa (peace be upon him) has been mentioned only twice in the Quran, in Surah Al-Anaam, Ayat 86 and here, without any detail about him. Only his name appears in the chain of the Prophets.
    - He was one of the major Prophets of Israel, belonged to Abel Meholah, a place on the river Jordan, and is well known as Elisha among the Jews and Christians. When the Prophet Elijah (peace be upon him) had taken refuge in the Sinai peninsula, he was commanded to return to Syria and Palestine for some important works, one of which was to prepare the Prophet Elisha for his successor-ship. Accordingly, when the Prophet Elijah came to his town, he found Elisha ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth. The Prophet Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him, and he left the oxen and followed him. (I Kings, 19:15-21). He remained under training with him for 10 to 12 years. Then, when Allah recalled Elijah, he was appointed Prophet in his place. (2 Kings, oh.2). The Second Book of the Kings gives a detailed account of the Prophet Elisha (chs, 2 to 13), which shows that when the Israeli state of northern Palestine got lost in polytheism, idol-worship and moral evils, Elisha a pointed Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, king of Israel against the royal dynasty due to whose misdeeds those evils had spread in Israel. Jehu not only put an end to Baal-worship, but also condemned to death every member of the wicked family, including its children. But in spite of this reformist revolution the evils that had taken root in Israel could not be completely eradicated, and after the death of the Prophet Elisha they assumed enormous proportions; so much so that the Assyrians began to invade Samaria whenever they pleased. (For details, see (E.N. 7 of Surah Bani-Israil) and(E.Ns 70, 71 of Surah As-Saaffat).)
- `and Dhu al-Kifl.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Dhul-Kifil also has been mentioned only twice in the Quran, in (Surah Al Anbiya, Ayat 85) and here. For our research about him see (E.N. 81 of Surah Al-Anbiya).
- `All were of the best.`


## Ayat 49

- `This was a remembrance.`
- `An excellent retreat awaits the God-fearing`

## Ayat 50

- `� everlasting Gardens with gates wide open for them`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The words mufattahat-al-lahum-ul-abwab may have several meanings:   
    - (1) They will go about in the Gardens (Paradise) freely without any hesitation. 
    - (2) No effort will have to be made to open the gates of Paradise, they will open automatically as soon as they will have the desire to enter them.
    - (3) The angels appointed for keeping Paradise will open the gates for them as soon as they see them.
  - This third meaning has been expressed more clearly at another place in the Quran, thus: When they arrive there, and its gates shall already have been opened, its keepers will say: Peace be upon you, you have fared well, enter here to dwell for ever. (Surah Az-Zumar, Ayat 73).

## Ayat 51

- `wherein they shall recline, wherein they shall ask for abundant fruit and drinks,`

## Ayat 52

- `and wherein there shall be with them well-matched, bashful mates.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Of equal age” may mean that they will be of equal age among themselves, and also that they will be of the same age as their husbands.

## Ayat 53

- **`All this is what you are promised for the Day of Judgement.`**

## Ayat 54

- `This is Our provision for you, never to end.`

## Ayat 55

- `All this (is for the God-fearing).`
- `But for the transgressors, an evil resort awaits them �`

## Ayat 56

- `Hell, where they will be roasted.`
- `An evil place to dwell!`

## Ayat 57

- `All this (is for them);`
- `so let them taste boiling water and pus,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Several meanings of the word ghassaq, as used in the original, have been given by the lexicographers:
    - (1) Any moisture that is discharged by the body in the form of pus, blood, or mixture of pus and blood, etc. and this includes tears as well.
    - (2) Something extremely cold.
    - (3) Something stinking and giving out offensive smell. However, the word is generally used in the first meaning only, though the other two meanings also are correct lexically.


## Ayat 58

- `and other sufferings of the kind.`

## Ayat 59

- `(Observing their followers advancing to Hell they will say, among themselves:`
  - `“This is a troop rushing in to you.`
  - `There is no welcome for them.`

  - `“Rather, no welcome to you. (You will roast in Hell.)`

  - `What an evil resort!”`

  - `“Our Lord, give twofold punishment in the Fire to him who has led us to this.”`

## Ayat 62

- `They will say to one another:`
  - `“But why do we not see those whom we considered him among the wicked?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This implies the believers whom the disbelievers used to look down upon as bad people in the world. It means: They will look around bewildered and will find only themselves and their guides in Hell but will find no trace of those people of whom they used to talk disparagingly in the world, and whom they used to mock in their meetings for talking about God, the Messenger and the Hereafter.

## Ayat 63

- `Is it that we mistakenly made fun of them;`
- `or have they disappeared from our sight?”`

## Ayat 64

- `Verily all this is true.`
- `This is how the inmates of the Fire will dispute among themselves.`
