**Ayat 15 - 26**

## Ayat 15

- `They are waiting for nothing except a single Cry,`
- `after which there will be no second Cry.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, only a single blast of the torment will be enough to annihilate them; no other will be needed for the purpose.
  - Another meaning of the sentence can be: After this they will get no more relief and no more respite.


## Ayat 16

- `They say:`
  - `“Our Lord, hasten to us our share (of chastisement) before the Day of Reckoning.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, Allah’s torment will be so severe and terrible as mentioned above, but just consider the behavior of these foolish people. They are telling the Prophet mockingly: Do not put off our affairs till the Day of Reckoning with which you are threatening us, but settle our account just now.: Whatever punishment is to be inflicted on us should be inflicted immediately.

## Ayat 17

- `(O Prophet), bear with patience what they say,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The allusion is to the absurd conversation of the disbelievers of Makkah, as narrated above, to the effect that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was a sorcerer and a liar, and to their objection whether he was the only fit person in the sight of Allah to be appointed as a Messenger, and to their some accusation that he had vested interest in preaching the doctrine of Tauhid to the people and not any religious mission.
- `and call to mind Our servant David,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Remember Our servant David”. It would mean: There is a lesson in this story for these people. Or it would mean: The remembrance of this story will help you too, to have patience.
    - As the narrative is meant to serve both purposes, comprehensive words have been used as contain both meanings. (For the story of the prophet David (peace be upon him), see(Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 251); (Surah Bani-Israil, Ayat 55); (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 78-81); (Surah An-Naml, Ayat 15) and the E.Ns thereof, and (E.Ns 14 to 16 of Surah Saba).)
- `who was endowed with great strength`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The words in the original are: dhal-ayd (possessor of the hands). The word “hand” is used metaphorically for strength and power not only in Arabic but in other languages also.
    - When as an attribute of the Prophet David (peace be upon him) it is said that he was a "possessor of the hands", it will necessarily mean that he possessed great powers.
    - These powers may mean the physical strength which he displayed during his combat against Goliath, military and political power by which he crushed the neighboring idolatrous nations and established a strong Islamic empire, moral strength by which he ruled like a poor king and always feared Allah and observed the bounds set by Him, and the power of worship by virtue of which, besides his occupations in connection with rule and government and fighting in the cause of Allah, he fasted every alternate day and spent a third of the night in worship according to a tradition of Bukhari.
    - Imam Bukhari in his History has related, on the authority of Abu- Darda, that whenever the Prophet David (peace be upon him) was mentioned, the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to say: **He was the greatest worshiper of God**.
- `and who constantly turned (to Allah).`

## Ayat 18

- `With him We had subjected the mountains that they join him in celebrating Allah's glory, evening and morning,`

## Ayat 19

- `and the birds, too, in their flocks, and turn again and again to celebrating Allah's glory.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For explanation, see( Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayat 79 and E.N. 71) thereof.

## Ayat 20

- `And We strengthened his kingdom`
- `and endowed him with wisdom and decisive judgement.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, he was never ambiguous in speech but clear and forthright.
  - Whatever problem he talked about he would lay bare its basic points, and would clearly and precisely determine the real issue under question, and would pass a decisive judgment.”
  - This quality is not attained by a person unless he is granted wisdom, understanding and mastery of language of the highest degree.


## Ayat 21

- `Has the story of the litigants reached you �`
- `of those who entered his private chambers by climbing over the wall?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The object why the Prophet David (peace be upon him) has been mentioned here is to relate the story that begins from here; the object of mentioning his sterling qualities in the introduction was only to point out the high caliber of the Prophet David (peace be upon him) with whom this incident took place.

## Ayat 22

- `As they came upon David � and he was frightened of them � they said:`
  - `“Be not afraid. We are just two litigants: one of us has committed excess against the other. So judge rightly between us, and be not unjust; and guide us to the Right Way.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - He was alarmed because the two men had appeared in the private quarters of the ruler of the land suddenly, by climbing over the wall, instead of going before him by the proper entrance.

## Ayat 23

- `Behold, this is my brother;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Brother” does not mean a real brother but a brotherin- faith and a member of one’s own clan.
- `he has ninety-nine ewes and I have only one ewe.”`
- `And yet he said:`
  - `“Give her into my charge,” and he got the better of me in argument.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - To understand what follows one should note that the complainant did not say that the other person had taken away his only ewe and added it to his own ewes, but said that he was asking for it, and since he was a powerful person he had prevailed over him in the matter and he could not reject his demand, being a weak and poor man.

## Ayat 24

- `David said:`
  - `“He has certainly wronged you in seeking to add your ewe to his ewes;`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Here, one should not doubt that the Prophet David (peace be upon him) gave his decision after hearing only what one party had to say.
      - The fact of the matter is that when the respondent kept quiet at the complaint of the complainant and said nothing in defense it by itself amounted to a confession by him.
      - That is why the Prophet David (peace be upon him) came to the conclusion that the facts of the case were the same as the complainant had stated.
  - `and indeed many who live together commit excesses, one to the other,`
  - `except those that believe and act righteously; and they are but few.”`
- `(While so saying) David realized that it is We Who have put him to test;`
- `therefore, he sought the forgiveness of his Lord, and fell down, bowing and penitently turning (to Him).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - There is a difference of opinion as to whether it is obligatory to perform a sajdah (prostration) on this occasion or not.
    - **Imam Shafai says that it is not obligatory, for this is only a Prophet’s repentance; but Imam Abu Hanifah has opined that prostration here is obligatory.**
    - The traditionalists have related three traditions from lbn- Abbas in this regard. 
      - According to Ikrimah, Ibn Abbas said: This is not one of those verses on the recitation of which prostration is obligatory, but I have seen the Prophet (peace be upon him) prostrating himself on this occasion. (Bukhari, Abu Daud, Tirmidhi, Nasai, Musnad Ahmad).
      - The second tradition which Saeed bin Jubair has related from Ibn Abbas is to the effect: The Prophet (peace be upon him) prostrated himself in Surah Suad and said: The Prophet David (peace be upon him) had prostrated himself in order to express his repentance and we prostrate ourselves as a token of gratitude, because his repentance was accepted. (Nasai)
      - In the third tradition that Mujahid has related from him, he says: Allah has commanded the Prophet (peace be upon him), in the Quran: These were the ones whom Allah had shown the right way; therefore, you should follow their way. (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayat 90). Now, since David was a Prophet and he had prostrated himself on this occasion, the Prophet (peace be upon him) also prostrated himself here only to follow his way. (Bukhari).
    - These three are the statements of Ibn Abbas.
    - Abu Said Khudri says: The Prophet (peace be upon him) once recited Surah Suad in his address, and when he came to this verse, he descended from the pulpit and performed a prostration and the audience also did the same along with him.
    - Then, on another occasion, he recited this same Surah and when the people heard this verse, they were ready to perform the prostration. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: This is the repentance of a Prophet, but I see that you have gotten ready to perform the prostration. Saying this he descended from the pulpit and prostrated himself and the people also did the same. (Abu Daud).
    - **Although these traditions do not provide any absolute argument to prove that it is obligatory to perform the prostration here, yet they prove at least that because the Prophet (peace be upon him) generally performed a prostration on this occasion, it is in any case commendable to prostrate here.**


## Ayat 25

- `Thereupon We forgave him his shortcoming`
- `and indeed (an exalted position of) nearness awaits him, and an excellent resort.`

## Ayat 26

- `(We said to him):`
  - `“O David, We have appointed you vicegerent on earth.`
  - `Therefore, rule among people with justice and do not follow (your) desire lest it should lead you astray from Allah's Path.`
  - `Allah's severe chastisement awaits those who stray away from Allah's Path, for they had forgotten the Day of Reckoning.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the warning that Allah gave to the Prophet David (peace be upon him) on accepting his repentance along with giving him the good news of exalting his rank. 
  - This by itself shows that the error that he had committed contained an clement of the desires of the flesh; it also pertained to the abuse of power and authority; and it was an act which was unworthy of a just and fair-minded ruler.
