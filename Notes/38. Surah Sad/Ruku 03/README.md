**Ayat 27 - 40**

## Ayat 27

- `We did not create this heaven and earth and all that lies between them in vain.`
- `That is the fancy of those who denied the Truth.`
- `So woe from the Fire to all who deny the Truth.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, We have not created anything in the world merely in sport and fun so that it may be without any wisdom and purpose and justice, and there may occur no result from any act, good or bad.
  - This is the conclusion of the preceding discourse as well as an introduction to the following theme.
  - The object of this statement as  a conclusion to the discourse is to impress the following truth: Man has not been left to wander about at will in the world, nor is this world a lawless kingdom that one may do here whatever he likes with impunity.
  - As an introduction to the following theme, the sentence is meant to say: The person who does not believe in the meting out of the rewards and punishments, and thinks that both the good and the evil people will ultimately end up in the dust after death and that nobody will be called to account, nor will anyone be rewarded for good or punished for evil, in fact, regards the world as a plaything and its Creator a senseless player, and thinks that by creating the world and man in it, the Creator of the Universe has committed a useless thing.
  - The same thing has been stated in different ways at several places in the Quran, e.g. **Did you think that We created you without any purpose, and that you would never be brought back to Us?** (Surah Al-Muminun, Ayat 115).

## Ayat 28

- `Shall We then treat alike those that believe and act righteously and those that create mischief on earth?`
- `Or treat alike the God-fearing and the wicked?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, do you think it is reasonable and fair that both the pious and the wicked should be treated alike in the end? Do you regard this concept as satisfying that the pious man should not get any reward for his piety and the wrongdoer should not receive any punishment for his sins?
  - Obviously, if there is to be no Hereafter, and there is to be no accountability and no rewards and no punishments for human acts, it negates both Allah’s wisdom and His justice, and the entire order of the Universe becomes a blind order.
  - On this assumption there remains no motive for doing good and no deterrent against evil. God forbid, if the Godhead of God should be such a lawless kingdom, the one who leads a pious life in the face of all kinds of hardships in the world and endeavors to reform the people, would be a foolish person, and the one who gains benefits by committing all kinds of excesses and enjoys sinful pleasures of life, would be a wise man.

## Ayat 29

- `This is the Blessed Book`
- `that We have revealed to you, (O Muhammad),`
- **`that people with understanding may reflect over its verses and those with understanding derive a lesson.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Quran has been called a blessed Book in the sense that it is highly useful for man. It gives him the best guidance to improve and reform his life. By following it he has only to gain and nothing to lose.

## Ayat 30

- `We bestowed upon David (an illustrious son), Solomon.`
- `How excellent a servant (of Ours he was)!`
- `Indeed he constantly turned to Us in devotion.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) has been mentioned already at the followings places:
    - (Surah Al- Baqarah, Ayat 102);
    - (Surah Bani-Israil, Ayat 5);
    - (Surah Al- Anbiya, Ayats 78-82);
    - (Surah An-Naml, Ayats 15-44);
    - (Surah Saba, Ayats 12-14).


## Ayat 31

- `And when one evening well-trained and running horses of noble breed were brought to him`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The words as-safinat-ul-jiyad in the original imply the horses, which are very calm and quiet when they stand, and very fast moving when they run.

## Ayat 32

- `he said:`
  - `“Lo! I have come to love this wealth`
  - `on account of the remembrance of my Lord.”`
- `And when the horses disappeared,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Arabic word khair in the text is used for abundance of wealth as well as for horses metaphorically. As the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) had kept these horses for fighting in the way of Allah, he called them khair.

## Ayat 33

- `(he ordered):`
  - `“Bring these horses back to me,”`
- `and then he began to gently stroke their shanks and necks.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There is a difference of opinion among the commentators about the translation and commentary of these verses.

## Ayat 34

- `Surely We put Solomon to the test and cast upon his throne a mere body.`
- `Thereupon he penitently turned (to Us).`

## Ayat 35

- `He said:`
  - `“My Lord, forgive me and bestow upon me a kingdom such as none other after me will deserve.`
  - `Surely You are the Bounteous Giver.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In view of the contest, the real object here is to relate this event; the preceding verses are an introduction to it.
  - Just as above this, first the Prophet David (peace be upon him) was praised, then the event narrated by which he was put to temptation, then it was said that Allah Almighty does not spare even such a beloved servant from accountability, then about his noble nature it was said that as soon as he was warned of the temptation, he repented and bowed before Allah and withheld himself from the act, so also here the sequence is like this: First, the Prophet Solomon’s (peace be upon him) high rank and his deep sense of devotion has been mentioned, then it is said that he was also put to the test, then it has been stated that when a mere body was placed on his throne, he immediately felt warned on his error, and pleading the forgiveness of his Lord, withdrew from the act, because of which he was involved in the temptation.
  - In other words, Allah by means of these two stories wants to impress two things upon the reader simultaneously:
    - (1) Not to speak of the common men, even high-ranking Prophets were not spared from His strict accountability;
    - (2) The right attitude for man is not to brag and feel proud after committing an error, but to bow down humbly before his Lord as soon as he realizes his sin.
  - **It was the result of this attitude that Allah not only forgave the mistakes of those illustrious men but blessed them with still more favors and kindness.**

## Ayat 36

- `We subjected the wind to him,`
- `so that it blew gently at his bidding, wherever he directed it,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For explanation, see (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayat 81 and E.N. 74) thereof. However, there is one thing which requires further explanation here.
  - In Surah Al-Anbiya where mention has been made of subjecting the wind for the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him), it has been described as the strongly blowing wind, but here “it blew by his command gently wherever he intended”. This means that the wind in itself was strong and violent as is needed for moving the sailing-ships but it had been made gentle for the Prophet Solomon in the sense that it blew whither-soever he wanted it to blow for his commercial fleets.

## Ayat 37

- `and We also subjected the devils to him �`
- `all kinds of builders and divers;`

## Ayat 38

- `and others that were bound with chains.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For explanation, see(Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayat 82);(Surah An-Naml, Ayats 17, 39 )and the E.Ns thereof.
  - The satans imply the jinns, and the satans linked in chains imply the serving satans, who were fettered and imprisoned as a punishment for making mischief.
  - It is not necessary that the fetters and chains in which those satans were bound might be made of iron and they might appear as bound in them like the human prisoners. 
  - In any case, they were imprisoned in a manner that they could neither escape nor were able to commit further mischief.

## Ayat 39

- **`“This is Our bestowal. So give or withhold as you wish without account.”`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse can have three meanings:
    - (1) This is Our unlimited gift: You have the authority to give of it freely to whomsoever you like and keep it from whomsoever you like.
    - (2) This is Our gift: You may give of it to whomsoever you like and keep it from whomsoever you like, you will not be called to account for giving it or keeping it from the people.
    - (3) Another meaning of it given by some commentators is: The satans have been placed entirely under your control: you may set free whomsoever you like and restrain whomsoever you like. You will not be held accountable for this.

## Ayat 40

- `Indeed an exalted position of nearness awaits him and an excellent resort.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here, the object is to tell that just as a servant’s arrogance causes Allah’s displeasure and wrath, so does his humility earns Allah’s pleasure and approval for him.
  - If a servant commits an error and becomes even more arrogant when warned, he is led to the same fate as is being mentioned in connection with the story of Adam and Satan below.
  - Contrary to this, if a servant happens to commit an error and he repents and bows down before his Lord humbly, he is blessed with such bounties as the Prophets David and Solomon (peace be upon them) were blessed with.
  - The prayer that Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) had made after seeking Allah’s forgiveness, was literally fulfilled and Allah actually granted him a kingdom as had neither been granted to anyone before him nor bestowed on anyone after him.
  - Having control over the winds and the jinns is an extraordinary power, which has been granted only to the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) and to none else in human history.
