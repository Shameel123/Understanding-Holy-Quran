**Ayat 42 - 54**
# Ruku 5



## Ayat 42

- `And ˹remember˺ when the angels said,`
- `“O Mary! Surely Allah has` 
  1. `selected you,` 
  2. `purified you, and` 
  3. `chosen you` 
- **`over all women of the world.`**

Tafsir-Ibn-Kathir:
- The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari said that the Messenger of Allah said,
  - **(Many men achieved perfection, but among women, only Maryam the daughter of Imran and Asiah, the wife of Firawn, achieved perfection.)**
- The Six -- with the exception of Abu Dawud - recorded it. Al-Bukhari's wording for it reads,
  - **(Many men reached the level of perfection, but no woman reached such a level except Asiah, the wife of Firawn, and Maryam, the daughter of Imran. The superiority of A'ishah (his wife) to other women, is like the superiority of Tharid (meat and bread dish) to other meals.)**


## Ayat 43

- `O  Mary!` 
- `Be devout to your Lord,`
- `prostrate yourself ˹in prayer˺ and`
- `bow along with those who bow down.”`

## Ayat 44

- `This is news of the unseen that We reveal to you ˹O Prophet˺.`
- `You were not with them when they cast lots to decide who would be Mary’s guardian,`
- `nor were you there when they argued ˹about it˺.`


Tafsir-Ibn-Kathir:
- Ibn Jarir recorded that Ikrimah said, 
- "Maryam's mother left with Maryam, carrying her in her infant cloth, and took her to the rabbis from the offspring of Aaron, the brother of Musa. 
- They were responsible for taking care of Bayt Al-Maqdis (the Masjid) at that time, just as there were those who took care of the Kabah. 
- Maryam's mother said to them, 
  - 'Take this child whom I vowed to serve the Masjid, I have set her free, since she is my daughter, for no menstruating woman should enter the Masjid, and I shall not take her back home.' 
- They said, 
  - 'She is the daughter of our Imam,' 
- as Imran used to lead them in prayer, who took care of our sacrificial rituals.
- Zakariyya said, 
  - 'Give her to me, for her maternal aunt is my wife.' 
- They said, 
  - 'Our hearts cannot bear that you take her, for she is the daughter of our Imam.' 
- So they conducted a lottery with the pens with which they wrote the Tawrah, and Zakariyya won the lottery and took Maryam into his care."'.

- Ikrimah, As-Suddi, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi bin Anas, and several others said that the rabbis went into the Jordan river and conducted a lottery there, deciding to throw their pens into the river. The pen that remained afloat and idle would indicate that its owner would take care of Maryam. When they threw their pens into the river, the water took all the pens under, except Zakariyya's pen, which remained afloat in its place. Zakariyya was also their master, chief, scholar, Imam and Prophet, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him and the rest of the Prophets.

## Ayat 45
- `˹Remember˺ when the angels proclaimed,`
  - `“O Mary! Allah gives you good news of a Word from Him,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      -  In the Quran, **Jesus is called the “Word” of Allah** since he was created with the word “Be!”
  - `his name will be the Messiah,2 Jesus, son of Mary;`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      -  **Messiah (Masîḥ)** means the “anointed one.” It is used in the Quran exclusively as a title for Jesus Christ.
  - `honoured in this world and the Hereafter,` 
  - `and he will be one of those nearest ˹to Allah˺.`

## Ayat 46
- `And he will speak to people in ˹his˺ infancy and adulthood and will be one of the righteous.`
Personal Analysis: I think, Allah SWT has mentioned two different ages of Hazrat Jesus AS for speaking to people in which first one denotes the time when He (AS) lived before and the next one denotes when He (AS) will come back again in this world.

Tafsir-Ibn-Kathir:
  - Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,
    - **(No infant spoke in the cradle except `Isa and the companion of Jurayj.)**

I think, when I was listening to the part where the innocence of Hazrat Yusuf (AS) weas to be presented then an infant child spoke up.
These two things are contradictory in my opinion and needs to be clarified with authentic sources.


## Ayat 47

- `Mary wondered,`
  - `“My Lord! How can I have a child when no man has ever touched me?”`
- `An angel replied,`
  - `“So will it be.`
  - **`Allah creates what He wills.`**
  - `When He decrees a matter,`
  - **`He simply tells it, ‘Be!’ And it is`**


## Ayat 48
- `And Allah will teach him` 
  - `writing and` 
  - `wisdom,` 
  - `the Torah and` 
  - `the Gospel,`


## Ayat 49
- `and ˹make him˺ a messenger to the Children of Israel` 
- `˹to proclaim,˺` 
  - `‘I have come to you with a sign from your Lord:` 
    - `I will make for you a bird from clay, breathe into it, and it will become a ˹real˺ bird—by Allah’s Will.`
    - `I will heal` 
      - `the blind and` 
      - `the leper and` 
      - `raise the dead to life—by Allah’s Will.` 
    - `And I will prophesize what you eat and store in your houses.` 
  - **`Surely in this is a sign for you if you ˹truly˺ believe.`**

Maarif-ul-Quran:
Many scholars stated that Allah sent every Prophet with a miracle suitable to his time. For instance, in the time of Musa, magic was the trade of the time, and magicians held a high position. So Allah sent Musa with a miracle that captured the eyes and bewildered every magician. When the magicians realized that Musa's miracle came from the Almighty, Most Great, they embraced Islam and became pious believers. As for Isa, he was sent during a time when medicine and knowledge in physics were advancing. `Isa brought them the types of miracles that could not be performed, except by one sent by Allah. How can any physician bring life to clay, cure blindness and leprosy and bring back to life those entrapped in the grave Muhammad was sent during the time of eloquent people and proficient poets. He brought them a Book from Allah; if mankind and the Jinn tried to imitate ten chapters, or even one chapter of it, they will utterly fail in this task, even if they tried to do it by collective cooperation. This is because the Qur'an is the Word of Allah and is nothing like that of the creatures.


## Ayat 50
- `And I will confirm the Torah revealed before me and legalize some of what had been forbidden to you`. 
- `I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so be mindful of Allah and obey me.`

## Ayat 51
 
 - `Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord.` 
 - `So worship Him ˹alone˺.` 
 - **`This is the Straight Path.’”`**


## Ayat 52

- `When Jesus sensed disbelief from his people, he asked,` 
  - **`“Who will stand up with me for Allah?”`**
- `The disciples replied,` 
  - **`“We will stand up for Allah. We believe in Allah, so bear witness that we have submitted.”`**


## Ayat 53

- `˹They prayed to Allah,˺` 
- **`“Our Lord! We believe in Your revelations and follow the messenger, so count us among those who bear witness.”`**


## Ayat 54
- `And the disbelievers made a plan ˹against Jesus˺,` 
- **`but Allah also planned—and Allah is the best of planners.`**


Maarif-ul-Quran:
In these verses the miraculous event of the Ascension of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) (Jesus Christ) has been mentioned. "And they made a move" refers to the evil designs of the Jews who planned to arrest him and to get him crucified.

The next sentence i.e. "and Allah made a move" refers to the plan designed by Allah Almighty to save his prophet Isa (علیہ السلام) from their ill designs. They sent one of them to Sayyidna Isa (علیہ السلام) to arrest him and Allah changed his face totally and made him resemble Sayyidna Isa (علیہ السلام) and raised Sayyidna Isa (علیہ السلام) to heavens, while that person was crucified under the mistaken identity. How Allah had planned to save ` Isa (علیہ السلام) from their clutches was disclosed to him when his enemies came to arrest him. The details of these disclosures have been mentioned in verse 55.
