**Ayat 172 - 180**
# Ruku 18

## Ayat 172
- `There were those who responded to the call of Allah and the Messenger`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - When, after the Battle of Uhud, the Makkan polytheists had travelled several stages of their journey, they began to tell themselves what a mistake they had made in allowing the opportunity to crush the power of Muhammad to slip out of their hands. 
    - At one place they halted and deliberated among themselves about launching a second attack on Madina. They failed, however, to muster sufficient courage and carried on to Makka. 
    - The Prophet, for his part, also realized that they might attack once again. 
    - On the second day of Uhud, therefore, he gathered the Muslims and urged them to pursue the unbelievers. 
    - Even though this was a highly critical moment, the true men of faith girded their loins and were prepared to lay down their lives at the behest of the Prophet. 
    - They accompanied him to Hamra' al-Asad, eight miles from Madina. The present verse refers to these dedicated men.
- `after injury had smitten them -`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - These few verses were revealed almost one year after the Battle of Uhud. 
    - As they are connected with the events of the battle they were included in the present discourse.
- **`for all those who do good and fear Allah there is a mighty reward.`**


## Ayat 174
- `When people said to them:` 
  - `'Behold, a host has gathered around you and you should fear them',` 
- `it only increased their faith and they answered:` 
- **`'Allah is Sufficient for us; and what an excellent Guardian He is!'`**


## Ayat 175
- `So they returned with a mighty favour and a great bounty from Allah having suffered no harm`
- `They followed the good pleasure of Allah,`
- `and Allah is the Lord of great bounty.`


## Ayat 176

- `It was Satan who suggested to you the fear of his allies.` 
- `Do not fear them;` 
- `fear Me, if you truly believe.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - While returning from the Battle of Uhud, Abu Sufyan challenged the Muslims to another encounter at Badr the following year. 
    - But when the appointed time arrived, Abu Sufyan's courage failed him on account of the famine prevailing in Makka that year. 
    - As a face-saving device he arranged to send an agent to Madina who spread the rumour that tremendous war preparations were afoot among the Quraysh, and that they were trying to muster a huge army which would be so powerful that no other power in the whole of Arabia would resist it.
    - The purpose of this rumour was to overawe the Muslims and discourage them from advancing towards Makka, so that when the confrontation did not take place it would be blamed on the timidity of the Muslims. 
    - The effect of this measure was such that when the Prophet (peace be on him) urged the Muslims to accompany him to Badr the initial response was not encouraging. 
    - Finally, the Prophet publicly announced that if no one would accompany him, he would go alone. 
    - In response, fifteen hundred devotees expressed their willingness and accompanied him to Badr.
    - Abu Sufyan set out with two thousand men but after travelling for two days he told his men that it seemed unwise to fight and that they would return the following year for the proposed encounter. 
      - Thus he and his men retreated. 
    - The Prophet and his Companions stayed at Badr for eight days awaiting the threatened encounter. 
    - Meanwhile, they conducted business with a trade caravan which yielded them considerable profit. Later, when it became known that the unbelievers had gone back to Makka, the Prophet returned to Madina. 
      - (See Ibn Hisham, vol. 2, pp. 209 f.; Ibn Ishaq, Life of Muhammad, pp. 447 f. - Ed.)


## Ayat 176

- `Let not those who run towards disbelief grieve you;` 
- `they shall not hurt Allah in the least.`
- `Allah will not provide for them any share in the Next Life.` 
- `A mighty punishment awaits them.`


## Ayat 177

- `Indeed those who have purchased unbelief in exchange for faith shall not hurt Allah in the least.` 
- `Theirs shall be a painful chastisement.`


## Ayat 178

- **`Do not let the, unbelievers imagine that the respite We give them is good for them.`**
- **`We give them respite so that they may grow in wickedness.`**
- `A humiliating chastisement lies in store for them.`

## Ayat 179

- `Allah will not let the believers stay in the state they are:`
- `He will set the wicked apart from the good.`
- **`Allah is not going to disclose to you what is hidden in the realm beyond the reach of perception,`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This means that God does not resort to revelation to provide information as to whether specific individuals are true men of faith or hypocrites. God creates, instead, certain situations in which the faith of those who profess to believe is severely tested. The result is that the man of faith stands out clearly from the hypocrite.
- **`but He chooses from among His Messengers whom He wills (to intimate such knowledge).`**
- **`Believe, then, in Allah and in His Messengers;`** 
- `and if you believe and become God-fearing, yours will be a great reward.`


## Ayat 180

- **`Those who are niggardly about what Allah has granted them out of His bounty think that niggardliness is good for them;`** 
- `it is bad for them.`
- **`What they were niggardly about will turn into a halter round their necks on the Day of Resur-rection.`**
- `To Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is well aware of what you do.`
