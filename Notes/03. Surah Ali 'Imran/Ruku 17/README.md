  - My views: Tawakkal is mentioned here.

This Ayat also continues with the concept of Tawakkal

- **`If Allah helps you none shall prevail over you; if He forsakes you then who can help you?`**
- **`It is in Allah that the believers should put their trust.`**


## Ayat 161
- `It is not for a Prophet to defraud;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - When the archers, whom the Prophet had posted to defend the army against any attack from the rear, saw that the spoils of the enemy were being collected, they feared that the spoils might fall in their entirety to the lot of the soldiers who were then collecting them, and that they might, therefore, be deprived of their share. 
    - It was this idea which had impelled them to leave their posts. 
    - When the Prophet returned to Madina after the battle he asked them to explain the cause of their disobedience. 
    - When he had heard their unconvincing stories he told them: 
      - 'You thought that we would act dishonestly and would not deliver you your share.' (See Alusi. Ruh al-Ma'ani, commentary on this verse - Ed.) 
    - The verse alludes to this here. The purpose is to impress upon them that the Messenger of God himself was the commander of their army and that all their affairs were in his hands alone. 
    - What made them feel that their interests were not secure even in the hands of God's Messenger? 
    - Did they think that a division of spoils under the direct supervision of the Prophet Would be made in any manner other than that dictated by absolute honesty, trustworthiness and justice?
- `and whoever defrauds shall bring with him the fruits of his fraud on the Day of Resurrection,` 
- **`when every human being shall be paid in full what he has earned, and shall not be wronged.`**


## Ayat 162

- `Is he who follows the good pleasure of Allah like him who is laden with Allah's wrath and whose abode is Hell?` 
- `How evil that is for a resting-place!`


## Ayat 163

- **`They vary greatly in rank in the sight of Allah,`**
- `and Allah sees what they do.`


## Ayat 164

- `Surely Allah conferred a great favour on the believers`
- `when He raised from among them a Messenger`
  - `to recite to them His signs,`
  - `and to purify them,`
  - `and to teach them the Book and Wisdom.`
- `For before that they were in manifest error.`


## Ayat 165
- `And how come when a calamity befell you, you began to ask:` 
  - `'How has this come about?'`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The more high ranking Companions were too well aware of reality to fall prey to any misunderstandings. 
      - The ordinary believers, however, had thought that as long as God's Messenger was in their midst and as long as they enjoyed God's support and help the unbeliever, could never triumph over them. 
      - Hence, when they suffered defeat at the Battle of Uhud, their expectations were shaken and they began to wonder why things had taken the course they had. 
      - They wondered why they had been defeated even though they had fought for the sake of God's true religion with God's support, and the Messenger of God was with them on the battlefield. 
      - Furthermore, they were worried that the defeat had been at the hands of those who were out to destroy God's true religion. 
      - These verses seek to allay this sense of anxiety and rid their minds of doubt and suspicion. 
- `even though the enemy has suffered at your hands (in the Battle of Badr) double what you have suffered!`
- `Say:` 
  - `This calamity has been brought about by yourselves.`
    - Tahfm-ul-Quran:
      - The calamity that had befallen them was the outcome of their own weaknesses and mistakes.
      - They had not remained sufficiently patient, they had acted, in certain respects, in a manner inconsistent with the dictates of piety, they had disobeyed the command that had been given them, they were lured by material wealth and they disputed and quarrelled among them-selves. 
      - After all this, was it still necessary to ask what caused the debacle?
- **`Surely Allah is All-Powerful.`**


## Ayat 166

- `What befell you on the day when the two hosts met was by the leave of Allah,` 
- **`and in order that He might mark out those who believe`**


## Ayat 167

- `and those who are hypocrites.` 
- `And when these hypocrites were asked:`
  - `'Come and fight in the wayof Allah', or (at least) 'defend yourselves',` 
- `they answered:` 
  - `'If we but knew that there would be fighting, we would certainly have followed.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - When 'Abd Allah b. Ubayy decided to withdraw from the battlefield with his men several Muslims attempted to persuade him not to do so. 
    - Ibn Ubayy replied that he was sure that there would be no fighting that day, and he assured them that had he expected fighting to take place, he would have gone along with them.
- `They were nearer then to infidelity than to faith.` 
- `They utter from their mouths what is not in their hearts.` 
- `Allah knows well what they conceal.`


## Ayat 168

- `These are the ones who stayed away, saying about their brothers:` 
  - `'Had they followed us, they would not have been slain.'` 
- `Say:` 
  - `'If you speak the truth then avert death when it comes to you.'`


## Ayat 169

- **`Think not of those slain in the way of Allah as dead.`**
- `Indeed they are living, and with their Lord they have their sustenance,`


## Ayat 170

- `rejoicing in what Allah has bestowed upon them out of His bounty,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - There is a Tradition from the Prophet that he who leaves the world after having lived righteously is greeted with a life so felicitous that he never wishes to return to the world. 
    - The only exception to this are martyrs who wish to be sent back to the world so that they may once again attain martyrdom and thereby enjoy that unique joy, bliss and ecstasy which one experiences at the time of laying down one's life for God. 
      - (Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. Ill, 103, 126, 153, 173, 251, 276, 278, 284, 289; Bukhari, 'Tafsir al-Qur'an', 6 and 21: Muslim, 'Al-Imarah', 108, 109. 121 - Ed.)
- `jubilant that neither fear nor grief shall come upon the believers left behind in the world who have not yet joined them.`


## Ayat 171

- `They rejoice at the favours and bounties of Allah,`
- `and at the awareness that` 
- **`Allah will not cause the reward of the believers to be lost.`**
