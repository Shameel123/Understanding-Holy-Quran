**Ayat 10 - 20**
# Ruku 2

## Overview
In this Ruku, Allah first informs us that the disbelievers cannot be helped by wealth or offspring (which are one of the tests that one should go through). They will be doomed like Paraoah and the ones who arrived before them and they *will be* overpowered!
Then Allah shifts His informs us that men are generally tempted by the following things:
- women
- childern
- treasures (gold and silver)
- horses of mark
- cattle
- plantations
Note: First two are the same ones which cannot help disbelievers!
**Aformentioned things are the enjoyments of this world only**
**ALLAH mentions better things than these which are for God-Fearing people**
- Garden (Jannah)
- Pure Spouses

It is given to those who pray to Allah as mentioned in Ayat 16:
`ٱلَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّنَآ ءَامَنَّا فَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ`

Further qualities are also mentioned:
- Steadfast
- Truthful
- Obedient
- Spenmd in the way of Allah
- Implore Forgiveness before Daybreak

## Ayat 10

- `Those who disbelieve,`
  - `neither their wealth`
  - `nor their offspring `
- `will avail them at all against Allah, `
- `and it is they who will be the fuel of the Fire`


## Ayat 11

- `(To them shall happen) the like of what happened to the people of Pharaoh,`
- `and those before them.`
- `They rejected Our signs, so Allah seized them for their sins.`
- `Allah indeed is severe in punishment.`


## Ayat 12

- `Tell those who disbelieved:`
- `'You shall soon be overpowered and mustered to Hell -` 
- `and that is an evil resting place!'`


## Ayat 13

- `You have already come across an instructive sign in the two hosts that encountered each other in battle (at Badr):`
  - `one host fighting in the way of Allah,` 
  - `and the other that of unbelievers.`
- `They saw with their own eyes that one host was twice the number of the other.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The actual disparity between the two armies was roughly three to one, but even a cursory glance was enough to tell the casual observer that the army of unbelievers was about twice as large as that of the believers.
- `But (the result of the battle has proved that) Allah succours with His victory whomsoever He wills.`
- **`In this there is surely a lesson for all who have eyes to see.`**


## Ayat 14

- `Men are naturally tempted by the`
  - `lure of women,`
  - `children,`
  - `treasures of gold and silver,`
  - `horses of mark,`
  - `cattle and`
  - `plantations.`
- `These are the enjoyments in the life of this world;`
- **`but with Allah lies a goodly abode to return to.`**


## Ayat 15

- `Say: 'Shall I tell you of things better than these?`
- `For the God-fearing there are, with their Lord,`
- **`gardens beneath which rivers flow;`**
- `there they will abide for ever,`
- **`will have spouses of stainless purity as companions,`**
- `and will enjoy the good pleasure of Allah.'`
- `Allah thoroughly observes His servants.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This shows that God neither showers His favours on people arbitrarily nor makes casual and superficial judgements. He knows full well the deeds and intentions of people. He also knows who merits His rewards and who does not.


## Ayat 16
### MEMORIZE THIS!

- `These are the ones who pray:`
  - **`'Our Lord! We do indeed believe, so forgive us our sins and keep us safe from the chastisement of the Fire';`**


## Ayat 17 

- `men who are`
  - `steadfast,`
  - `truthful,`
  - `obedient,`
  - `spend (in the way of Allah) and`
  - `implore the forgiveness of Allah before daybreak.`


## Ayat 18

- **`Allah Himself bears witness that there is no God but He;`** 
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The testimony in question is from God Himself, Who knows directly all the realities of the universe, Who observes every existing thing without obstruction. 
    - It is the testimony of the One from Whose sight nothing is hidden, and who can be a better first-hand witness than He?
    - His testimony is that no one but He is possessed of the attributes of godhead; no one has the power to govern the universe, and no one has the right to claim the rights which belong exclusively to God.
- `and likewise` 
  1. `do the angels and` 
  2. `the men possessed of knowledge`
     - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
       - After God, the most trustworthy testimony is that of the angels, for they carry out the administration of the universe. The testimony of the angels, based on their own observations, is that the Will of God alone reigns supreme in the universe, and they turn to Him alone in the governance of the heavens and the earth. 
       - Moreover, all creatures possessing knowledge of reality have testified, unanimously, that no one except the One True God reigns and rules over the universe.
- **`bear witness in truth and justice that there is no God but He,`**
- **`the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.`**


## Ayat 19

- `The true religion with Allah is Islam.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In the sight of God there is only one system of life and way of conduct which is both in accord with reality and morally right. 
    - **This consists of man's acknowledging God as his Lord and the sole object of his worship and devotion; of surrendering himself unreservedly to God in obedience and service.**
    - In doing so he should follow in to the guidance communicated by God through His Messengers rather than try to devise ways of serving God according to his own lights.
    - This mode of thought and action is known as Islam, and it is only reasonable that the Lord and Creator of the universe should accept nothing less from His creatures and servants. 
    - In his folly man thinks that he has the right to believe in and follow every doctrine that comes his way whether it be atheism or idolatry. In the sight of the Sovereign of the universe, however, all such attitudes amount to nothing short of rebellion against God.
- `The People of the Book adopted many different ways rather than follow the true way of Islam even after the knowledge of truth had reached them,`
- `and this merely to commit excesses against one another.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **This shows that the religion of every Messenger of God, in every age and clime, was none other than Islam (submission to God).** 
    - Likewise, every Divine book, in whichever language it was revealed, and to whichever people it was addressed, contained the teachings of Islam. 
    - The various religions which have spread among mankind are distortions of this true, original religion, and are the result of tampering.
    - Coveting privileges over and above those to which they were entitled, people altered the beliefs, principles and injunctions of the true religion in a manner conducive to their own interests.
- `Let him who refuses to follow the ordinances and directives of Allah know that Allah is swift in His reckoning.`


## Ayat 20

- `And if they remonstrate with you, tell them:` 
  - **`'I have submitted my whole being to Allah, and so have those who follow me.'`**
- `And ask the People of the Book as well as those who follow no heavenly Scripture:`
  - **`'Have you also submitted (to Allah)?'`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Prophet (peace be on him) is asked to tell them in effect: 
      - I and my followers have embraced the original, unadulterated Islam which is the true religion enjoined by God. 
      - Tell us, now, if you are prepared to give up the accretions introduced by your forefathers, and embrace this original, true religion?'
- `If they have submitted to Him, they are indeed on the right way`
- `but if they deviate from submitting to Allah,`
- **`then your duty is merely to deliver the message.`**
- `Allah observes the affairs of His servants.`
