**Ayat 72 - 80**
# Ruku 8


## Ayat 72

- `A party of the People of the Book said:` 
- `'Believe in the morning what has been revealed to those who believe,` 
- `and then deny it in the evening that they may thus retract (from their faith).'`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This was one of the devices adopted by the leaders and rabbis of the Jews who lived on the outskirts of Madina in order to damage the mission of Islam. 
  - To demoralize the Muslims and create misgivings about the Prophet (peace be on him), they sent their agents to embrace Islam publicly, then to renounce it, and subsequently to go about telling people they had done so because of the faults they had found in Islam, the Muslims and their Prophet.


## Ayat 73
- `They also say among themselves:` 
  - `'Do not follow anyone except him who follows your faith.'` 
- `Say: `
  - **`'Surely true guidance is Allah's.`**
  - ` It is His favour that anyone should be given the like of what you have been given in the past,` 
  - `and that others should have been given firm evidence to proffer against you before your Lord.'` 
- `Say:` 
  - **`'Surely bounty is in the Hand of Allah;`**
  - **`He gives it to whom He wills.`**
- `Allah is` 
  - `All-Embracing,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The word wasi' which is used here occurs in the Qur'an in three contexts. 
      1. The first context is the narrow-mindedness and mean outlook of certain people, in contrast to which God is not 'narrow'. 
      2. The second context is the denunciation of miserliness, meanness and niggardliness, in contrast to which God is Generous and Munificent. 
      3. The third context is the ascription of finite, limited concepts to God as a result of their limited imagination, whereas the truth is that God is infinite see (Surah 2, n. 116 above) 
  - `All-Knowing.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, God knows who deserves to be honoured and exalted.

## Ayat 74
- **`He singles out for His mercy whomever He wills,`**
- `Allah is possessed of abounding bounty.'`


## Ayat 75
- `And among the People of the Book there are some who would restore you even if you were to entrust a treasure of gold,` 
- `and of them there are some whom were you to entrust with one gold piece, will not restore it unless you stand over them.` 
- `That is because they say:` 
  - `'We will not be taken to task for whatever we may do to non-Jews (ummls).`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This was not merely the misconception of the ignorant mass of Jews. 
      - Their religious teaching was the same and the legal doctrines of their accepted religious authorities and jurists reflected this idea.
      - With regard to injunctions on loans and interest the Bible makes a clear distinction between an Israelite and a non-Israelite (Deuteronomy 15: 1-3; 23: 20).
      -  It is stated in the Talmud that if the bullock of an Israelite injures the bullock of a non-Israelite the former is not liable to any penalty, but not vice versa. Similarly, it is laid down that if anyone finds an unclaimed article he should enquire amongst the people who live nearby. If they are Israelites he should announce his find; if not he may keep it without saying anything further.Rabbi Samuel Ishmael says that if a dispute between a Jew and a Gentile is brought before a judge, he should base his verdict on Jewish law if it is favourable; if the law of the Gentiles goes in favour of the Jew he should justify his judgement by saying that the Gentile has no valid ground for complaint since judgement was given according to his own law. Even if both laws are unfavourable towards the Jew the judge should still find some pretext for deciding in his favour. Rabbi Samuel says that benefit should be derived from every mistake the non-Israelite may make. (See Paul Isaac Hershon, Talmudic Miscellany, London, 1880, pp. 37 and 210-21.)
  -  `Thus they falsely fix a lie upon Allah, and do so wittingly.`

My explanation:
This Ayah differentiates 2 types of people.
Type 1: The ones who returns the good people entrust them.
Type 2: The ones who do not return the good people entrust them.

Type 2 people believe that they are not accountable for the goods if it belongs to *Al-Ummiyeen* (Unlettered).
I think, this Ayah could be directed towards Muslims such that we must not only take care of the goods of fellow Muslims in this scenario but for every other human being out there. Unlettered here could mean that they are not aware of the *real* knowledge that is Islam but that does not give us the right to take over their goods.
Because this means, such type of people *fix a lie* upon Allah SWT *knowingly*. What a horrible thing to do!




## Ayat 76
- **`But Allah loves only those who fulfil their covenant and fear Allah.`** 
- **`Truly Allah loves the God-fearing.`**


## Ayat 77

- **`There shall be no share in the Life to Come for those who sell away the covenant of Allah and their oaths for a trivial gain.`**
- `On the Day of Resurrection Allah will neither address them, look at them, nor will He purify them.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The reason is that, despite their worst crimes, they still thought that on the Day of Judgement they alone would be honoured with God's favour, and that towards them alone He would turn His gracious attention. 
    - They also entertained the belief that if they had been stained by any trace of sin, it would be washed away by the grace of their pious elders. 
    - Such people are warned here that the treatment meted out to them in the Next Life will be altogether contrary to their expectations.
- `A painful chastisement lies ahead of them.`


## Ayat 78
- `And there is a party among them who twist their tongues while reciting the Book to make you think that it is part of the Book when in fact it is not.`
  - My Analysis:
    - This DIRECTLY relates to our age where the scholars tries to sell their own beliefs by 'twisting; their tongues and make other believe that it is the message of Allah where infact, it is their own false message that they are trying to propogate.
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This could mean that they either distort the meaning of the Scriptures or twist the words of the text in order to misinterpret it. 
    - Its real meaning, however, seems to be that when, during their reading of the Scriptures, they encounter any word or sentence which goes against their interests, and the beliefs and notions which they cherish, they distort the meaning of it by deliberately twisting their tongues. 
    - Instances of such tongue-twisting are not altogether wanting among those who, despite their belief in the Qur'an, share some of these people's characteristics. 
    - **For instance, some people who stress the superhuman character of the Prophet (peace be on him) misread the following verse: innama ana basharun mithlukum (Qur'an 18: 110) (I am nothing but a human being like you), replacing innama by inna ma ana and translate it: '(O Prophet), say to them: "I am not a human being like you."**
- **`They say: 'It is from Allah', when in fact it is not from Allah.`**
- `They falsely fix a lie upon Allah, and do so wittingly.`
  - This part of fixing a lie was mentioned in Ayah 75 in the same ruku above.

## Ayat 79
- `It does not befit a man that Allah should grant him` 
  1. `His Book and` 
  2. `sound judgement and`
  3. `prophet-hood, and` 
- `thereafter he should say to men:` 
  - `'Become servants to me apart from Allah.'` 
- `He would rather say:` 
  - `'Become dedicated men of Allah, in accord with the dictates of the Book you have been teaching and studying.'`


## Ayat 80
The Ayah continues from the previous one.

- `He will never enjoin you to take the angels or Prophets for your lords.` 
- **`Will he enjoin upon you unbelief when you have submitted yourselves to Allah?`**
