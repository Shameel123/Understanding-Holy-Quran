**Ayat 102 - 109**
# Ruku 11


## Ayat 102

- `Believers!`
- **`Fear Allah as He should be feared,`**
- **`and see that you do not die save in the state of submission to Allah.`**
  - May Allah keep all of us on Straight Path and have our Imaan with us at the time of our death! Ameen!


## Ayat 103
- `Hold fast together to the cable of Allah`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **The expression 'cable of Allah', in this verse, refers to the 'religion of God'.** 
    - The reason for use of the word 'cable' (habl) is that it both establishes a bond between man and God and joins all believers together. 
    - To take a firm hold on this cable means that the believers should attach profound importance to their religion: 
      - this should always be the centre of their concerns; 
      - they should continually strive to establish it; 
      - and the common desire to serve it should make them co-operate with each other.
    - As soon as Muslims turn their attentions away from the fundamental teachings of their religion and lose sight of establishing its hegemony in life **they begin to concern themselves with matters of secondary importance.**
    - And, just as they rent the communities of the former Prophets, enticing people away from their true objective in life, so schisms and dissensions are bound to plague their lives. 
    - If Muslims do this they are bound to suffer indignity and disgrace both in this world and the Next as happened with the followers of the previous Prophets.
- **`and be not divided.`**
- `Remember the blessing that Allah bestowed upon you:`
  - `you were once enemies then He brought your hearts together,`
  - `so that through His blessing you became brothers.`
  - `You stood on the brink of a pit of fire and He delivered you from it.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This refers to the state of the Arabs on the eve of the advent of Islam. 
      - There were animosities among the tribes which regularly broke out into fighting; every now and then there was much bloodshed. 
      - Things had reached a point that the entire Arabian nation seemed to be on the verge of destroying itself.
      - It was due to the blessings of Islam alone that it was saved from being consumed by the fire to which this verse alludes. 
      - **The people of Madina had embraced Islam some three or four years before these verses were revealed.**
      - They had witnessed the blessing of Islam as it unified into one**brotherhood the Aws and Khazraj**, two tribes which had long been sworn enemies. 
      - Moreover, both tribes treated the migrants from Makka in a spirit of sacrifice and love seldom seen even among members of the same family.
- **`Thus Allah makes His signs clear to you that you may be guided to the right way.`**


## Ayat 104

- `And from among you there must be a party who invite people to all that is good` 
- `and enjoin the doing of all that is right`
- `and forbid the doing of all that is wrong.`
- **`It is they who will attain true success.`**

Subhan Allah! Allah gave us the key to success, that is, to invite others for good and stop them from wrong.
BUT, first, we must ask Dua from Allah SWT to guide us to the straight path and allow us to perform the actions provided in this Ayah! Ameen!

## Ayat 105
- `Do not be like those who fell into factions and differed among themselves`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The reference is to those communities which received clear and straightforward teachings of the true religion but who had abandoned the fundamentals, forming separate sects around trivial and subsidiary questions; they became so engrossed in quarrelling over superfluous and insignificant questions that they lost sight of the mission God had entrusted to them, and even lost interest in those fundamentals of belief and righteous conduct which are essential for man's salvation and felicity.
- `after clear signs had come to them.` 
- **`A mighty chastisement awaits them.`**

May Allah protect us from such people and keep us away from becoming one of them as mentioned in the Ayah! Ameen!


## Ayat 106
- `On the Day when some faces will turn bright and ther faces will turn dark. `
- `Those whose faces have turned dark will be told:` 
  - **`'Did you fall into unbelief after you had been blessed with belief? `**
- `Taste, then, chastisement for your unbelief.`

May Allah protect us from turning towards unbelief after we have accepted belief! Abd make our faces bright on the Final Day! Ameen!

## Ayat 107
- `And those whose faces have turned bright,`
- `they will be in the mercy of Allah,`
- `and therein they shall abide.`

May Allah make us from one of those as mentioned in the Ayah! Ameen!

## Ayat 108
- `These are the messages of Allah which We recite to you in truth,`
- `and Allah desires no wrong to the people of the world.`


## Ayat 109
- `To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth,`
- **`and to Allah are all matters referred for decision.`**

Subhan Allah! Such a wonderful conclusion to the Ruku where we are guided to not to go astray once we have acknowledged the right path! All matters referred to Allah SWT at the end of the day and we must be careful at all times!
