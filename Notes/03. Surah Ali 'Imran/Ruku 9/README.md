**Ayat 81 - 91**
# Ruku 8


## Ayat 81
- `And recall when Allah took a covenant from the Prophets:` 
  - `'This is the Book and the Wisdom which I have given you.` 
  - `But should a Prophet come to you confirming that which is already with you, you shall believe in him and shall help him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - A party of the People of the Book would fain lead you astray, whereas in truth they lead none astray except themselves, but they do not realize it.
  - `So saying, Allah asked:`
    - `'Do you agree and accept to take up the burden of the covenant?'`
  - `They answered:`
    - `'We agree,'`
  - `He said: 'Then bear wirness; and I will be with you among the witness.`


## Ayat 82
- `Then whosoever shall turn away from this covenant they are the transgressors.`

## Ayat 83
- `Do they now seek a religion other than prescribed by Allah even though all that is in the heavens and the earth is in submission to Him`
  - 
- `- willing or unwillingly -`
- ``and to Him all shall return?`


## Ayat 84
- `Say:`
  - `'We believe in Allah`
  - `and what was revealed to us` 
  - `and what was revealed to Abraham` 
  - `and Ishmael`
  - `and to Issac`
  - `and Jacob`
  - `and his descendents,`
  - `and the teachings which Allah gave to` 
  - `Moses and`
  - `Jesus and`
  - `to other Prophets.`
  - **`We make no distinction between any of them`**
  - `and to Him do we submit.`


## Ayat 85
- **`And whoever seeks a way other than this way a submission (Islam),`**
- **`will find that it will not be accepted from him`**
- **`and in the Life to come he will be among the losers.`**


## Ayat 86
- `How can Allah guide people who once believed,`
- `after they received clear signs and affirmed that the Messenger was a true one, lapsed into disbelief.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is a repetition of the statement made earlier, namely that the Jewish rabbis of Arabia in the time of the Prophet (peace be on him) knew, and sometimes even testified to verbally, that Muhammad was a true Prophet and that his teachings were the same as those of the earlier Prophets. (See for instance Qur'an 2: 89 - Ed.) 
    - Their subsequent attitude - namely that of rejection and opposition - was the outcome of prejudice and intransigence, born out of their centuries-old hostility to the Truth.
- **`Allah does not guide the wrong-doers.`**

## Ayay 87
- **`The recom- pense for their wrong-doing is that the curse of Allah and of the angels and of all men shall upon them.`**

## Ayat 88

- **`Thus shall they abide. Neither shall their chastisement be granted nor shall they be granted any respite.`**

## Ayat 89
My analysis:
Earlier 2 Ayah mentioned hte punishment for those who beleived and then went astray, in this Ayah, Allah mentions hope for those people
- `But those who repent and mend their ways shall be excepted` 
- **`for indeed Allah is Forgiving, All-Compassionate.`**

## Ayat 90
- **`Those who relieved and have har-dened in their disbelief after once believing,`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - They were not content with just rejecting the call to the Truth but stood in vehement opposition and hostility to it and spared no efforts in obstructing people from following the way of God. 
    - They created doubts, spread misgivings, sowed the seeds of distrust and engaged in the worst conspiracies and machinations in order to frustrate the mission of the Prophet (peace be on him).
- `their (pretence to) repentance shall not be accepted.` 
- `Indeed such men have altogether strayed.`

## Ayat 91

- **`Truly those who disbelieved and died as unbelievers,`**
- **`not even an earth full of gold will be accepted from them as ransom.`**
- `For such people there is painful chastisement;` 
- `and none shall come to their help.`
