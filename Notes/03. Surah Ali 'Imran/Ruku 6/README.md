**Ayat 55 - 63**
# Ruku 6

## Ayat 55

- `˹Remember˺ when Allah said,` 
  - `“O Jesus! I will take you`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      -  ‘Mutawaffîka’ means literally: “I will make you reach the end of your worldly term.” 
      -  The popular Muslim belief is that a conspiracy was made to kill Jesus. 
      -  Allah made the main culprit who betrayed Jesus look exactly like Jesus, while the culprit was crucified. 
      -  Similar to Christians, Muslims believe in the second coming of Jesus (ﷺ).
  - `and raise you up to Myself.`
  - `I will deliver you from those who disbelieve,`
  - `and elevate your followers above the disbelievers until the Day of Judgment.` 
  - **`Then to Me you will ˹all˺ return, and I will settle all your disputes.`**

## Ayat 56

- `As for those who disbelieve,` 
- `I will subject them to a severe punishment in this life and the Hereafter,` 
- `and they will have no helpers.`


I am confused here because previously we learned that the disbelievers will also get the share in this world.
I think the context in this Ayah is related to the ones who planned against Hazrat Jesus (AS).


## Ayat 57

- `And as for those who believe and do good,`
- `they will be rewarded in full.` 
- `And Allah does not like the wrongdoers.”`


## Ayat 58

- `We recite ˹all˺ this to you ˹O Prophet˺ `
- `as one of the signs and` 
- `˹as˺ a wise reminder.`


## Ayat 59

- **`Indeed, the example of Jesus in the sight of Allah is like that of Adam.`**
- **`He created him from dust, then said to him, “Be!” And he was!`**

Subhan Allah, this is such a reference that never came to my mind before learning this Ayah!


## Ayat 60

- `This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt.`


## Ayat 61

- `Now, whoever disputes with you ˹O Prophet˺ concerning Jesus after full knowledge has come to you, say,` 
  - `“Come! Let us gather` 
    - `our children and your children,` 
    - `our women and your women,` 
    - `ourselves and yourselves—`
  - **`then let us sincerely invoke Allah’s curse upon the liars.`**`”`

## Ayat 62

- `Certainly, this is the true narrative,` 
- **`and there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Allah`.**
- **`And indeed, Allah ˹alone˺ is the Almighty, All-Wise.`**


## Ayat 63
- `If they turn away,` 
- **`then surely Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the corruptors.`**
