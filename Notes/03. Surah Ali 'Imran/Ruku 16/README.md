**Ayat 149 - 155**
# Ruku 16


## Ayat 144

- `Believers!`
- `If you follow those who deny the Truth, they will drive you back on your heels,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they would push them back into the same state of unbelief from which they had extricated themselves.
    - Since the Battle of Uhud the hypocrites and the Jews had constantly propagated the idea that, had Muhammad been a true Prophet, he would not have suffered the reverse that he encountered in that battle. 
    - This reverse was offered as proof that Muhammad (peace be on him) was an ordinary person whose fortunes varied, like those of other men, between victory and defeat.
    - They further contended that the support and patronage of God which Muhammad claimed to enjoy was a sham. 
- **`and you will turn about, losers.`**


## Ayat 150

- **`But Allah is your Protector, and He is the best of helpers.`**


## Ayat 151

- **`We will cast terror into the hearts of those who have denied the Truth`**
- `since they have associated others with Allah in His divinity -` 
- `something for which He has sent down no sanction.`
- `The Fire is their abode; how bad the resting place of the wrong-doers will be!`


## Ayat 152

- `Allah surely fulfilled His promise (of succour) when you were slaying them by His leave until the moment when you flagged and quarrelled among yourselves about the matter,` 
- `and acted against the order of (the Prophet).` 
- `Soon He showed you what you had intensely desired - `
- `for some among you sought this world and some of you sought the Next.` 
- `Thereupon, in order to put you to a test He turned you away from your foes.`
- ` Still He pardoned you after that`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The failure of the Muslims was of such a serious nature that had God not pardoned them they might have been obliterated there and then. 
    - It was out of God's grace, support and patronage that after the Muslims had been overpowered by the enemy the latter were seized with perplexity and confusion, and withdrew.
- **` for Allah is Bounteous to those who believe.`**


## Ayat 153

- `Recall when you were fleeing without casting even a side glance at anyone,`
- `and the Messenger was calling out to you from the rear.` 
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - When subjected to a sudden two-pronged attack the Muslims scattered; some fled to Madina while others climbed Mount Uhud. 
    - Despite this, the Prophet (peace be on him) did not move from his position. 
    - The enemy surrounded him on all sides and only a small party of ten to twelve followers was left with him. 
    - Even at that critical moment his feet remained firm and he continued to summon his fleeing followers towards himself. 
      - (See Waqidi, Maghazi, vol. 1, pp. 237, 240 and 241 - Ed.)
- `Then Allah requited you by inflicting grief after grief upon you`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The 'grief referred to in this verse had many causes: 
      - (i) by the setback the Muslims suffered on the battlefield and by the rumour that the Prophet (peace be on him) had been martyred; 
      - (ii) by the fact that a large number of believers had been killed and wounded; and 
      - (iii) by the fact that nothing was known about what was happening to the Muslim families left behind in Madina.
      - For it was possible that the enemy was greater in numbers than the total population of Madina, and that it might break through the defences of the battered.
- `so as to instruct you neither to grieve for the losses you might suffer nor for the afflictions that might befall you.` 
- **`Allah knows all that you do.`**



## Ayat 154

- `Then, after inflict-ing this grief,` 
- `He sent down an inner peace upon you - a sleep which overtook some of you.` 
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - A strange phenomenon was then experienced by certain Muslim soldiers. 
    - Abu Talhah, who took part in the battle, states that the Muslims were seized by such drowsiness that their swords were slipping from their hands. 
      - (For several Traditions stating this incident, including one related by Abu Talhah, see Waqidi, Maghazi, vol. 1, pp. 295-6 - Ed.)
- `Those who were concerned merely about themselves, entertaining false notions about Allah - the notions of the Age of Ignorance - asked:` 
  - `'Have we any say in the matter?'` 
- `Tell them:` 
  - `'Truly, all power of decision rests solely with Allah.'` 
- `Indeed, they conceal in their hearts what they would not reveal to you, saying: `
  - `'If we had any power of decision, we would not have been slain here.'`
- `Say:` 
  - **`'Even if you had been in your houses, those for whom slaying had been appointed would have gone forth to the places where they were to be slain.'`** 
- `And all this happened so that Allah might test your secret thoughts and purge your hearts of all impurities.`
- **`Allah knows well what is in the breasts of men.`**


## Ayat 155
- `Surely those of them who turned their backs on the day when the two armies met (at Uhud) did so`
  - `because Satan made them slip because of some of their lapses.` 
- `But Allah has pardoned them;`
- **`He is All-Forgiving, All-Forbearing.`**
