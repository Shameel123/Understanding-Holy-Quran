## Overview

Tahfom-ul-Quran:

This section constitutes the conclusion of the present surah. It is related not so much to the verses which immediately precede it as to the entire surah. In order to grasp its significance one should particularly bear in mind our introductory remarks to this surah. (See pp. 229 ff. above.)


**It is reported that some non-Muslims came to the Prophet and said that Moses had produced his staff and had been endowed with the miracle of the shining hand see( Qur'an 7: 108; 20: 22), and that Jesus restored sight to the blind and cured the lepers see (Qur'an 31 49). Other Prophets had also been granted miracles. What miracles, they enquired, could the Prophet perform? In response the Prophet recited all the verses from (verse 190 )to the end of this surah, adding that that was what he had brought.**

  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The original Arabic word is " sabiru". This has two possible meanings. One is that whenever they are in confrontation with unbelievers, the believers should endure even greater hardships for their cause, and display a higher degree of fortitude than the unbelievers. The other is that the believers should try to excel one another in facing the opposition and hostility of unbelievers with courage and fortitude.
- `stand firm in your faith,` 
- `and hold Allah in fear`
- **`that you may attain true success.`**
