**Ayat 130 - 143**
# Ruku 14

## Ayat 130

- `Believers!`
- `Do not swallow interest,`
  - `doubled and redoubled,` 
- `and be mindful of Allah so that you may attain true success.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The major cause of the setback suffered at Uhud was that precisely at the moment of their victory the Muslims succumbed to the desire for worldly possessions, and turned to collecting booty rather than completing their task of crushing the enemy. 
    - Hence God thought fit to raise a barrier against this excessive adoration of money, and to urge them to give up usury which keeps man constantly absorbed in considering ways and means of amassing wealth and generally whets his appetite for money.


## Ayat 131
- `And have fear of the Fire which awaits those who deny the Truth.`

## Ayat 132
- `And obey Allah and the Messenger, that you may be shown mercy.`

## Ayat 133
- `And hasten to the for-giveness of your Lord and to a Paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the God-fearing.`

## Ayat 134

- `who spend in the way of Allah`
  - `both in plenty and hardship,`
- `who restrain their anger,` 
- `and forgive others.` 
- **`Allah loves such good-doers."`**


# Ayat 135

- `These are the ones who,` 
- `when they commit any indecency and wrong against themselves,` 
- `instantly remember Allah and implore forgiveness for their sins -` 
- `for who will forgive sins save Allah? -` 
- `and who do not wilfully persist in the wrong they did.`


## Ayat 136

- `They shall be recompensed by forgiveness from their Lord and` 
- `by gardens beneath which rivers flow;` 
- `there they shall abide.` 
- `How good is the reward of those who labour!`


## Ayat 137

- `Many eras have passed before you.` 
- `Go about, then, in the land and` 
- `behold the end of those who gave the lie to (the directives and ordinances of Allah).`


## Ayat 138

- `This is a plain exposition for men,` 
- `and a guidance and admonition for the Godfearing.`


## Ayat 139
- `Do not, then, either lose heart or grieve:` 
- `for you shall surely gain the upper hand if you are true men of faith.`


## Ayat 140

- `If a wound has befallen you a similar wound has already befallen the people who are opposed to you.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This alludes to the Battle of Badr. 
    - The intention is to point out to the Muslims that if the unbelievers were not demoralized by the setback they suffered at Badr then the Muslims should not be disheartened by the setback thev suffered in the Battle of Uhud.
- `We make such movements to men in turn so that Allah might mark out those who are the true men of faith and select from among you those who do really bear witness (to the Truth):`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The actual words of this verse, can be interpreted in two ways. 
      - One meaning could be that God wanted to select some of them so that He could bestow upon them the honour of martyrdom. 
      - The second meaning could be that out of the hotch-potch of true believers and hypocrites which their community consisted of at that moment, God wanted to sift those who were truly His witnesses over all mankind. See( Qur'an 2: 143 - Ed.)
- `for Allah does not love the wrong-doers,`



## Ayat 141

- `and makes men go through trials in order` 
- `that He might purge the believers and`
- ` blot out those who deny the Truth.`


## Ayat 142

- **`Did you think that you would enter Paradise even though Allah has not yet seen who among you strove hard in His way and remained steadfast?`**



## Ayat 143

- `You previously longed for death (in the way of Allah):` 
- `now you have faced it, observing it with your own eyes.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is with reference to those Companions who had urged the Prophet to go out of Madina and take on the enemy there because of their ardent desire for martyrdom. 
    - (See Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqat, vol. 2, p. 38 - Ed.)
