## Ayat 92

- **`You shall not attain righteousness until you spend out of what you love (in the way of Allah).`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The purpose of this verse is to remove the misconception of the Jews concerning 'righteousness'. 
    - The Jews had inherited an elaborate legal code which had accumulated as a result of the casuistry and hair-splitting legalism of their jurists.
    - Their notion of 'righteousness' consisted of outward, formal conformity to that code and they evaluated all day-to-day actions, especially the trivial ones, in terms of conformity to that code. 
    - Narrow-mindedness, greed, covetousness, meanness, concealment of the Truth and readiness to barter with it lay beneath this veneer of formal piety. 
    - They were, nevertheless, considered pious in the minds of the people; 
    - Jewish public opinion condoned their conduct because it conformed to its concept of 'righteousness'.
    - In order to remove this misconception they are told that the things they considered fundamental to righteous conduct are of little consequence. 
    - **The real spirit of righteousness consists in the love of God - a love which makes man value the good pleasure of God above all worldly acquisitions.**
    - **If the love of anything seizes a man's mind to such an extent that he is unable to sacrifice it for the sake of the love of God, then that thing has virtually become an idol, and until he smashes it the door to righteousness will remain closed to him.** 
    - If a man lacks this spirit, then his excessively formal and legalistic approach in religious matters can be considered no more than glossy paint over a piece of hollow, worm-eaten wood. 
    - It may be possible to deceive human beings by the sheer lustre of the outer paint, but not God.
- **`Allah knows whatever you spend.`**
  - I think, this may sound positive and negative both as it assures the ones who sacrifice that they love is that *Allah Knows* and similarly, the ones who avoid, for them it is a warning that *Allah Knows*


## Ayat 93

- `All food (that is lawful in the Law revealed to Muhammad) was lawful to the Children of Israel,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - When the Jewish rabbis found no grounds for criticizing the fundamental teachings of the Prophet (there was no difference between the teachings of the previous Prophets and that of the Arabian Prophet on matters which constitute the core of religion), they raised objections about the details of religious law. 
    - The first objection was that the Prophet (peace be on him) had declared lawful a number of things which had been reckoned as unlawful since the time of the ancient Prophets. What is said here is a refutation of that objection.
- `except what Israel made unlawful to themselves before the revelation of the Torah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - If 'Israel' is taken to mean the 'Children of Israel' then the interpretation of this verse must be that before the revelation of the Torah they treated a number of things as prohibited on the grounds of custom and usage alone. 
    - If, however, 'Israel' signifies Jacob (Ya'qub) then, the meaning is that he avoided the use of certain foods, which his descendants wrongly understood to be religiously prohibited, as a result of either a temperamental dislike or an ailment. This latter version is more commonly accepted. It becomes clear from the next verse that the Biblical injunction regarding the prohibition of the flesh of camels and rabbits was not part of the original Torah but an interpolation by Jewish doctors. (For a detailed discussion see ( Surah 6, n. 122 below.)
- `Tell them:` 
  - **`'Bring the Torah and recite any passage of it if you are truthful.'`**


## Ayat 94

- `Those who falsely fix lies upon Allah despite this are the wrong-doers.`

## Ayat 95 

- `Say:`
  - **`'Whatever Allah has said is true.`**
  - `Follow, then, the way of Abraham in total devotion to Allah.`
  - `He was not one of those who associate others with Allah in His divinity.`

## Ayat 96

- `Behold, the first House (of Prayer) established for mankind is the one at Bakkah:` 
  - `it is full of blessing and a centre of guidance for the whole world.`
Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- The second objection raised by the Jews was that the direction for Prayer had been changed from Jerusalem to the Ka'bah. 
- This objection is answered in (Surah 2 (see verses 142 ff. and nn. 142 and 147 above) 
- **The Bible, itself, testifies that Jerusalem was built by Solomon more than four and a half centuries after Moses** (see 1 Kings 6: 1), 
- and that it was during his time that the worshippers of the One God began to pray towards it (1 Kings 8: 29-30). 
- It is established by traditions from numerous sources which are undisputed throughout Arabia, however, that 
- **the Ka'bah was constructed by Abraham who lived some eight or nine centuries before Moses.** 
- **That the Ka'bah was older than the Temple of Jerusalem was beyond dispute.**


## Ayat 97

- `In it there are clear signs and the station of Abraham;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here it is stressed that there are several clear signs which prove that the Makkan sanctuary enjoys God's blessing and has been chosen by Him as His sanctuary. 
    - Even though it is located in the middle of wide expanses of desert God has seen to it that its inhabitants enjoy a satisfactory living. 
    - Although the rest of Arabia was plunged into chaos and disorder for about two and a half thousand years, peace and tranquillity reigned in both the precincts and the environs of the Ka'bah. 
    - **Thanks to the Ka'bah the entire Arabian peninsula enjoyed four months of peace and order every year.** 
    - These were the sacred months when people went on Pilgrimage.
    - **Moreover, barely a half century before the revelation of these verses, people had seen how Abrahah, the Abyssinian invader, fell prey to God's scourge when he attacked Makka with the intention of destroying the Ka'bah.**
    - At that time, this incident was known to everybody in Arabia. Its memory was fresh and many eye-witnesses were still alive at the time of the Prophet (peace be on him).
- `whoever enters it becomes secure.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Even during the pre-Islamic era - the Age of Ignorance in Arabia - this sanctuary enjoyed such veneration that even those who thirsted for each other's blood saw their enemies in the sacred territory but dare not attack them.
- **`Pilgrimage to the House is a duty owed to Allah by all who can make their way to it.`**
- **`As for those who refuse to follow His command, surely Allah does not stand in need of anything.`**
 

 ## Ayat 98
 - `Say:`
 - `'People of the Book!`
 - **`Why do you reject the signs of Allah when Allah is witness to all that you do?'`**

## Ayat 99
- `Say:`
  - `'People of the Book!`
  - `Why do you hinder one who believes from the way of Allah,` 
  - `seeking that he follow a crooked way,` 
    - `even though you yourselves are witness to its being the right way?'`
  - **`Allah is not heedless of what you do.`**

This appears to me to be a very strong sign for us... Because of our ego, we might force a rightful person to go astray even though we know that, that person is doing good deeds. 


## Ayat 100
- `Believers! Were you to obey a party of those who were given the Book,`
- **`they might cause you to renounce the Truth after you have attained to faith.`**


## Ayat 101
- `How can you disbelieve when you are the ones to whom the signs of Allah are recited and amidst you is His Messenger?
- **`Whoever holds fast to Allah will certainly be guided to the straight way.`**
