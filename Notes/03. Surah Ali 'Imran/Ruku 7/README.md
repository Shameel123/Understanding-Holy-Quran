**Ayat 64 - 71**
# Ruku 7

## Overview
This marks the beginning of the third discourse of this surah. 
**Its contents invite the conclusion that the surah was revealed sometime between the battles of Badr and Uhud.**
The subjects of these three discourses are so closely interrelated that some commentators have wrongly understood the verses which follow to be part of the foregoing discourse. 
From the whole tenor of the discourse which now begins, however, it is evident that it is addressed to the Jews.

## Ayat 64

- `Say: 'People of the Book! Come to a word common between us and you:`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The invitation here is for the two parties to agree on something believed in by one of them, 
    - the Muslims, and the soundness of which could hardly be denied by the other party, the Christians. 
    - For this was the belief of their own Prophets and had been taught in their own scriptures.
- `that we shall serve none but Allah` 
- `and shall associate none with Him in His divinity`
- `and that some of us will not take others as lords beside Allah.'`
- `And if they turn their backs (from accepting this call), tell them:` 
  - `'Bear witness that we are the ones who have submitted ourselves exclusively to Allah.'` 


## Ayat 65

- `People of the Book!`
- `Why do you dispute with us about Abraham even though the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after the time of Abraham?`
- `Do you not understand?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, both Judaism and Christianity came into existence after the Torah and the Injil had been revealed;
    - Abraham had lived much earlier than that.
    - Thus it can easily be grasped that the religion of Abraham could not have been that of either Judaism or Christianity. 
    - If Abraham was on the right path and had attained salvation it is obvious that one need not follow either, Judaism or Christianity in order to be on the right path and to attain salvation. (See also (Surah 2, nn. 135 and 141 above.)


## Ayat 66
- `Behold, you are those who have disputed greatly concerning matters which you knew;`
- `why are you now disputing about matters that you know nothing about?`
- **`Allah knows it whereas you do not know.`**


I think, we learn from this Ayah that sometimes we transgress from our limits. Sometimes we argue with someone with the knowledge that we have but sometimes we transgress from this and exceeds our own limits which we must never do at any cost.
Because **Allah knows and we do not know**.

## Ayat 67


- `Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian;` 
- **`he was a Muslim, wholly devoted to God.`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word hanif denotes someone who turns his face away from all other directions in order to follow one particular course. We have tried to convey this sense through the expression: 'a Muslim, wholly devoted to God'.
- `And he certainly was not amongst those who associate others with Allah in His divinity.`


## Ayat 68

- `Surely the people who have the best claim to a relationship with Abraham are those who followed him in the past,`
- `and presently this Prophet and those who believe in him;` 
- **`Allah is the guardian of the men of faith.`**


## Ayat 69

- `A party of the People of the Book would fain lead you astray,` 
- `whereas in truth they lead none astray except themselves,` 
- `but they do not realize it.`


I think this directly relate to us in our current era and we must be very concern to not to be involved with any party who would lead us astray.
But Allah has given us hope and warning that such party is leading themselves away from the Right Path and they do not realize it.
*May Allah protect us from them and from one of them. Ameen.*


## Ayat 70

- `O People of the Book!`
- `Why do you reject the signs of Allah even though you yourselves witness them?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Another rendering of this could be, 'and you yourselves bear witness' to Muhammad's prophethood. 
    - However it is translated the sense remains the same. 
    - In fact, the impeccable purity of the life of the Prophet, the astounding impact of his teachings and training on the lives of his Companions, and the loftiness of the teachings of the Qur'an all constituted such illustrious signs of God that it was very difficult for anyone conversant with the lives of the Prophets and the tenor of Divine Scriptures to doubt the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be on him).
    - It is a fact that many Jews and Christians (especially their scholars) came, to recognize in their hearts that Muhammad was the very Prophet whose coming had been announced by the preceding Prophets. 
    - This fact was so overwhelming that, despite their intransigence, they could not help but give verbal expression, at times, to the truth of the Prophet's teachings. 
    - This is why the Qur'an repeatedly blames them for maliciously misrepresenting the signs of God which they saw with their own eyes and to which they themselves attested.


## Ayat 71
- `People of the Book!`
- **`Why do you confound Truth with falsehood,`** 
- **`and why do you conceal the Truth knowingly?`**
