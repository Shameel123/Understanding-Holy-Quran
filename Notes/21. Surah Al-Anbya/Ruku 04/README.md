**Ayat  42 - 50**

## Ayat 42

- `Tell them, (O Muhammad):`
- `"Who protects you, during the night or the day from the Most Compassionate Lord?"`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is to say, who is there to protect and save you from the scourge of Allah if you are suddenly visited by it any time during the night or day.
- `And yet they turn away from the Admonition of their Lord.`


## Ayat 43

- `Do they have any gods who would protect them against Us?`
- `They have no power even to help themselves;`
- `nor do they enjoy Our support.`

## Ayat 44

- `Nay, We generously provided them and their fathers, and they enjoyed Our provision for long.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In other words it means: These people have been deluded by Our favor and Our provisions. They think they are enjoying prosperity and good life as their personal right and there is none to take it away from them. They have forgotten that there is God above them Who is able to make or mar their fortune.
- `Do they not see that We are now advancing into their territory, diminishing it from different sides?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this connection, see (Surah Ar-Raad, Ayat 41 and E.N. 60) thereof.
    - Here it bears an additional meaning also: Do they not see that an All-Powerful Being is showing His signs every now and then everywhere on the earth in the form of famines, epidemics, floods, earthquakes and other calamities.
    - Millions of people are killed, habitations and harvests are destroyed and other damages are caused, which frustrate all human designs?
- `Is it they, then, who will triumph?"`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It means: When they know that all the resources and provisions of life are in Our hands and that We can increase or decrease them as We will, do they have the power and strength to defend themselves against Our punishment?
    - Can they not see from these signs that their power, prosperity and luxury are not everlasting and that there is an All-Powerful Allah to seize and punish them.

## Ayat 45

- `Tell them:`
  - **`"I only warn you by the Revelation."`**
- `But the deaf do not hear the cry when they are warned.`

## Ayat 46

- `Were only the slightest whiff from your Lord's punishment to touch them,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
       - That is, the same scourge which they are demanding to be hastened and of which they are making fun.
- `they would cry out:`
  - `"Woe to us; we were indeed wrong-doers."`

## Ayat 47

- `We shall set up just scales on the Day of Resurrection so that none will be wronged in the least.`
- `(We shall bring forth the acts of everyone), even if it be the weight of a grain of mustard seed.`
- `We shall suffice as Reckoners.1`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - See also (verses 8-9 and E.Ns 8-9 of Surah Al-Aaraf).
  - It is difficult for us to understand the exact nature of the balance. Anyhow, it is clear that the balance will weigh accurately all the human moral deeds instead of material things, and will help judge whether a man is virtuous or wicked and how much.
  - The Quran has used this word to make mankind understand that every deed, good or bad, will be weighed and judged according to merit.

## Ayat 48

- `Surely We had granted to Moses and Aaron`
- `the Criterion (between right and wrong),`
- `and Light and Admonition for the good of the God-fearing,`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - From here begin the stories of the Prophets.
  - If we consider these stories in the context in which they occur, it becomes clear that these have been related to impress the following themes.
    1. All the former Prophets were human beings. Therefore there is nothing strange or unusual that a human being like Muhammad (peace be upon him) has been sent as a Messenger.
    2. The mission and teachings of this Prophet are the same as of those who were sent before him.


## Ayat 49

- `for those who fear their Lord without seeing Him`
- `and dread the Hour (of Reckoning).`

## Ayat 50

- `This is a Blessed Admonition that We have revealed.`
- `Are you, then, going to reject it?`
