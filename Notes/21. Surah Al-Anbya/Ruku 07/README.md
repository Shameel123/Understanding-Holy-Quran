**Ayat  94 - 112**


## Ayat 94

- **`Then whosoever does righteous works, while believing,`**
  - Righteous deeds needs to be done while "believing"...
- `his striving will not go unappreciated.`
- **`We record them all for him.`**


## Ayat 95

- `It has been ordained against every town that We ever destroyed`
- `that they shall not return (to enjoy a new lease of life)`

## Ayat 96

- `until Gog and Magog are let loose,`
- `and begin swooping from every mound,`

## Ayat 97

- `and the time for the fulfilment of the true promise of Allah draws near,`
- `whereupon the eyes of those who disbelieved will stare in fear,`
- `and they will say:`
  - **`"Woe to us, we were indeed heedless of this;`**
  - `nay, we were wrongdoers."`


  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - For the details about Gog and Magog, see (E.Ns 62 and 69 of Surah Al-Kahf).
    - They will be let loose in the sense that they will swoop down on the regions of the earth like a beast of prey which is set free from its cage suddenly.
    - The time of the fulfillment of the true promise will come on the eve of Resurrection and the appearance of Gog and Magog will be a sign of it.
    - In a tradition related in Muslim, by Huzaifah bin Asid Ghifari, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
      - Resurrection will not take place until ten signs appear:
        1. The smoke.
        2. Dajjal.
        3. Daabat-ul-Ard.
        4. Rising of the sun from the west.
        5. Coming down of Jesus, son of Mary.
        6. Sudden attack of Gog and Magog.
        7. Three land slides, one in the east,
        8. the second in the west
        9. and the third in Arabia.
        10. The flare up of a great fire from Yaman which will drive the people to the Plain of Resurrection.
    -  In another tradition the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated that after the swoop of Gog and Magog, Resurrection will be so near that it may take place at any moment just as a pregnant woman might deliver the child at any moment, in the day or night, after her term has expired.
    -  But the reference to the appearance of Gog and Magog in the Quran and Hadith does not indicate that they will swoop on mankind jointly. It may be that they will clash against each other near the time of Resurrection and their mutual conflict might result in a universal catastrophe and destruction.
 

## Ayat 98

- `(They will be told):`
  - `"Verily you and the gods you worshipped beside Allah are the fuel of Hell.`
  - `All of you are bound to arrive there.`

  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - We learn from traditions that Abdullah bin Azzaara raised an objection in this connection, saying: According to this not only our deities but Prophets Jesus and Uzair (peace be upon them) and the Angels also will become fuel for Hell because they are also worshiped.
    - The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: Yes, everyone who would approve of his own worship instead of Allahâ€™s will go to Hell along with those who worshiped him.
    - He meant to say: There is no reason why Prophets Jesus and Uzair (peace be upon them) and the Angels should go to Hell because they never approved that they should be worshiped instead of Allah, and were not responsible for this. On the other hand, they taught people to worship Allah alone.
    - Of course, those who tried to become deities and became partners in the shirk of others will certainly go to Hell along with their worshipers. Likewise those, who induced others to take deities other than Allah, will go to Hell.
    - Satan comes under this category for he induces others to make deities. Thus it is Satan who is made the real deity whom they obey and commit shirk. Besides this, idols of stone and wood and other accessories of shirk will also be thrown into Hell along with the mushriks so that the latter should see that their deities were becoming a cause of the intensity of their torture of fire instead of becoming their intercessors.

## Ayat 99

- `Had these indeed been gods they would not have gone there.`
- `But (as it is), all of you shall ever abide in it."`

## Ayat 100

- `There they shall groan with anguish and the din and noise in Hell will not let them hear anything.`

  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Arabic word zafeer means hard breathing because of excessive heat, hard work and weariness.


## Ayat 101

- `But for those whom We had decided to favour with good reward,`
- `they shall be kept far removed from Hell.`

  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - These will be the people who practiced virtue and righteousness in this world. Allah has already promised that they will be kept safe from the torture and will be granted salvation.

## Ayat 102

- `They shall not hear even a whisper of it,`
- `and they shall live for ever in the delights which they had desired.`

## Ayat 103

- `The Hour of the Great Terror shall not grieve them,1`
- `and the angels shall receive them saying:`
  - **`"This is your Day which you had been promised."`**

## Ayat 104

- `On that Day We shall roll up the heavens like a scroll for writing.`
- `Even as We originated the creation first so We shall repeat it.`
- `This is a promise binding on Us; and so We shall do.`

## Ayat 105

- `Surely We wrote in the Psalms, after the exhortation, that the earth shall be inherited by My righteous servants.`

## Ayat 106

- `We have sent you forth as nothing but mercy to people of the whole world.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse can also be translated as: We have sent you only as a blessing for the people of the world.
  - In both cases it will mean that the appointment of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is indeed a blessing and mercy of Allah to the whole world.
  - This is because he aroused the neglectful world from its heedlessness and gave it the knowledge of the criterion between truth and falsehood, and warned it very clearly of both the ways of salvation and ruin. This fact has been stated here to tell the disbelievers of Makkah that they were quite wrong in their estimate of the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he was an affliction and distress for them because they said: This man has sown seeds of discard among our clans and separated near relatives from each other. They have been told here: **O people, you are wrong to presume that he is an affliction for you; but he is in reality a blessing and mercy of Allah for you.**

## Ayat 107

- `Say:`
  - `"It is revealed to me that your God is only One God.`
  - `Will you, then, submit to Him?"`

## Ayat 108

- `If they turn away, say to them: "I have warned you all alike; and I cannot say whether what you have been promised1 is near or distant.`

## Ayat 109

- `If they turn away, say to them:`
  - `"I have warned you all alike;`
  - `and I cannot say whether what you have been promised is near or distant.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, I do not know the time and the form of the punishment of Allah for your rejection of the message. It may come at any time in any shape.

## Ayat 110

- `Indeed He knows what you say loudly and what you hide.`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This refers to their secret schemes, plots and their whispering campaign which have been mentioned in (verse 3).
  - There, too, the Prophet (peace be upon him) had said: **My Lord has the knowledge of everything that is said in the heavens or the earth for He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.** (verse 4). This was to warn them that they would be taken to task for these things, too.


## Ayat 111

- `I think that this [reprieve] is possibly a trial for you,`
- `an opportunity to enjoy yourselves until an appointed time."`
 
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This was a trial because the delay in the punishment was deluding them into believing: All the things put forward by the Prophet are false. Had he been a true Prophet of Allah, we would have been punished long before this for our disbelief.
  - They did not realize that the reason for the delay was that Allah willed to give them respite for mending their ways.

## Ayat 112

- `The Messenger said:`
  - `"My Lord! Judge with truth.`
  - `Our Compassionate Lord alone is our support against your (blasphemous) utterances."`
