**Ayat  76 - 93**

## Ayat 76

- `We bestowed the same favour upon Noah.`
- `Recall, when he cried to Us before;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This refers to Prophet Noah’s (peace be upon him) prayer which he at last made after having tried his utmost to reform his people: Lord, help me for I have been overpowered. (Surah Al-Qamar, Ayat 10), and Lord, do not leave even a single disbeliever on the earth. (Surah Nooh, Ayat 26).
- `We accepted his prayer and delivered him and his household from the great distress`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Great affliction” may either refer to living a miserable life among the wicked people, or to the flood.
    - (For the story of Prophet Noah, see(Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats: 59-64); (Surah Younus, Ayats 72-74);(Surah Houd, Ayats 25-48), and( Surah Al-Isra, Ayat 3) and the E.N.s thereof).


## Ayat 77

- `and We helped him against a people who rejected Our signs as false.`
- `They were indeed an evil people and so We drowned them all.`


## Ayat 78

- `We bestowed the same favour upon David and Solomon.`
- `Recall, when they gave judgement regarding a tillage into which the sheep of some people had strayed at night, and We were witnesses to their judgement.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There is no mention of this event in the Bible, nor in the Jewish literature. According to the Muslim commentators, it happened like this:
  - The goats of one person entered into the field of another person at night. The latter brought his complaint to Prophet David who decided that the strayed goats should be given to the owner of the field. 
  - Prophet Solomon, however, differed with this and opined that the goats should remain with the owner of the field up to the time that the former tilled and prepared the field as before.
  - In regard to this Allah says: We led Solomon to the right decision. 
  - As regards the legal aspect of the matter, we cannot say with certainty what is the Islamic law in such a case nor is there any tradition of the Prophet (peace be upon him) to explain or support it. 
  - That is why the jurists have differed about it.

## Ayat 79

- `We guided Solomon to the right verdict,`
- `and We had granted each of them judgement and knowledge.`
- `We made the mountains and the birds celebrate the praise of Allah with David.`
- `It was We Who did all this.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It should, however, be noted that in this context, the incident has been cited to show that the Prophets were after all human beings in spite of their God given powers and abilities.
  - In this case, Prophet David committed an error of judgment because he was not guided by Allah as was Prophet Solomon, though both of them were Prophets.
  - In the succeeding passage the wonderful powers of both have been mentioned to show that they were God given and did not make anyone a god.


## Ayat 80

- `It was We Who taught him the art of making coats of mail for your benefit so that it may protect you from each other's violence.`
- `Do you, then, give thanks?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - According to(Surah Saba, Ayats 10-11), it was like this: And We made the iron soft for him (and commanded him): Make coats of mail complete in every way, and arrange the plates properly. This shows that Allah had made Prophet David an expert in the use of iron, and had especially taught him the art of an armorer for defense purposes.
  - This fact is confirmed by archaeological and historical researches, for according to these the iron age in the world started between 1200 and 1000 BC and this was precisely the period of Prophet David.
  - At first the Hittites in Syria and Asia Minor, who flourished between 2000 and 1200 BC, discovered a method of melting and molding iron, but they guarded it as a close secret from the world, and it could not be put to common use. Later on, the Philistines came to know of it, but they too guarded it as a secret. The incessant defeats suffered by the Israelites at the hands of the Hittites and the Philistines before King Saul, were due mainly to the use of chariots of iron in their wars by the latter. (Joshua, 17:16; Judges, 1: 19, 4: 2-3). In 1020 BC when Saul became ruler over the Israelites by Allah’s command, he subdued the Canaanites and recaptured most of Palestine. After him Prophet David (1004-965 BC) not only annexed the whole of Palestine and Jordan to the Israeli kingdom but a major portion of Syria as well. This was the time when the secret of armor making closely guarded by the Hittites and the Philistines, became well known and cheaper articles of daily use began to be made. The recent archaeological excavations conducted in Edom, to the south of Palestine, which is rich in iron ore, have brought to light furnaces for melting and molding iron. The furnace excavated near Ezion-geber, a port on the Gulf of Aqabah, in the time of Prophet Solomon, seems to have been built on the principles which are used in the modern blast furnaces.
  - It is therefore natural that Prophet David must have first of all utilized this discovery for war purposes, because a little earlier the hostile Canaanites around his kingdom had made life really difficult for his people.
  - The Bible also says that Prophet David was an expert in the art of melting and using iron for war purposes.
    - (See Joshua, 17: 16; Judges, 1:19 and 4: 2-3).
  - For further details about Prophet David, please see (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 251) and (Sura Al-Isra, Ayat 55 )and the E.Ns thereof.

## Ayat 81

- `And We subdued the strongly raging wind to Solomon which blew at his bidding towards the land We blessed.1`
- **`We know everything.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is also explained in(Surah Saba, Ayat 12): **And for Solomon We had subjected the wind which covered a month’s journey in the morning and a month’s journey in the evening,**
  - and in (Surah Suad, Ayat 36): **So We subjected the wind to him. It blew softly at his bidding wherever he wanted it to blow.**
  - Thus it is clear that the wind was so subjected to Prophet Solomon that the voyages to places at one month’s sea journey could be performed conveniently, because a favorable wind was always blowing for his ships to and from those places.


## Ayat 82

- `And We subdued many devils who dived (into the sea) for him and carried out other jobs besides that.`
- **`We kept watch over all of them.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The subjection of satans has been explained in (Surah Saba, Ayats 12-13).
  - Incidentally, these verses of the Quran clearly show that the satans and jinns who worked for Prophet Solomon belonged to quite a different genus from human beings.
  - Therefore, it is wrong to pervert the Quran to prove that they were human beings as some modernist commentators have tried to do.
  - It is obvious from the wording of the Quran and the context in which the story of the jinns has been related, that they were not human beings.
  - Had they been so this would have been no special favor to Solomon, because human beings had already built the gigantic monuments like the pyramids of Egypt.


## Ayat 83

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There is a wide divergence of opinion concerning the personality, period and nationality of Prophet Job.
  - Some commentators opine that he was an Israelite, while others think that he was an Egyptian or an Arab who lived before Prophet Moses, or during the time of Prophets David and Solomon (peace be upon them all).
  - As all these conjectures are based on the Book of Job, which is self-contradictory and against the Quran. Nothing can be said about him with certainty, but in the light of the Book of Isaiah (8th century BC) and the Book of Ezekiel (6th century BC), which are more trustworthy works, he lived in the 9th century BC or even earlier.
  - As regards to his nationality, the context in which his name occurs in (Surah An-Nisa, Ayat 163) and (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayat 84), it may be assumed that he was an Israelite.
  - According to a saying of Wahb bin Munabbih, he might have been from the offspring of Esau, a son of Prophet Isaac.

- `We bestowed (the same wisdom, judgement and knowledge) upon Job.1`
- `Recall, when he cried to his Lord:`
  - **`"Behold, disease has struck me and You are the Most Merciful of those that are merciful."`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The words of the prayer are note-worthy.
  - Prophet Job mentions his distress but does not say anything more to his Lord except: **You are the most Merciful.**
  - This is a great proof of his fortitude, noble and contented nature.

## Ayat 84

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - How his disease was cured has been explained in (Surah Suad, Ayat 42): 
    - **Stamp the ground with your foot: here is cool water for you to wash with and to drink.** 
  - From this it appears that no sooner did he stamp the ground than a spring gushed forth. He took bath and drank the water and was cured of his disease.
  - The nature of the treatment hints that he was suffering from a skin disease. This is confirmed by the Bible as well.
  - Satan smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. (Job, 2:7).

- `We accepted his prayer and removed the affliction1 from him,`
- `and We not only restored to him his family but as many more with them as a mercy from Us and as a lesson to the worshippers.2`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It will be worthwhile to compare the high character of Prophet Job as given in the Quran with that in the Book of Job in the Bible.
  - The Quran presents him as a veritable picture of patience and fortitude and an excellent model for the worshippers of Allah,
  - but his general picture presented in the Book of Job is that of a man who is full of grievance against God:
    - **Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived. Let them curse (the night) that curse the day. Because it shut not the doors of my mother’s womb, nor did sorrow from mine eyes. Why died I not from the womb?**
      - (Chapter 3).
    - **Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balance together, the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.**
      - (Chapter 6)
    - **I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? Why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? And why dost thou not pardon my transgressions, and take away my iniquity?**
      - (Chapter 7: 20-21).

## Ayat 85

- `And (We bestowed the same favour) upon Ishmael, Idris and Dhu al-Kifl, for they were all steadfast.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Zul-Kifl is not the name but the title of a righteous man, which literally means a man of luck.
  - Here it does not refer to worldly prosperity but to his high character and ranks in the Hereafter.
  - He has also been mentioned by this title in( Surah Suad, Ayat 48).
  - There are different opinions about his identity and nationality.
  - Some have regarded him as Zacharias but this is not correct because Zacharias has been mentioned separately in (verse 89).
  - Others say that he was Elias, or Joshua, son of Nun, or Elisha, but this again is incorrect, because in (Surah Suad, Ayat 49 )Elisha and Zul- Kifl have been mentioned as separate personalities.
  - Some others say that he was Prophet Job’s son, named Bishr, who succeeded him as Prophet.

## Ayat 86

- `And We admitted them into Our mercy, for they were of the righteous.`

## Ayat 87

- `And We bestowed Our favour upon Dhu al-Nun.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Jonah, literally Dhun-Nun means the man of the fish. He was called so because he was devoured by a fish by the command of Allah. 
    - Also See (Surah As-Saffaat, Ayat 142) and (Surah Younus, Ayat 98 and its E.Ns 98-100).

- `Recall, when he went forth enraged,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Prophet Jonah left his people before he received Allah’s command for migration.

- `thinking We have no power to take him to task.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - He presumed that he should leave, the place which was going to be visited by the scourge of Allah. This was not by itself an offence but it was an offence for a Prophet to leave the place of his mission without the permission of Allah.
- `Eventually he cried out in the darkness:"`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Darkness”: the darkness in the belly of the fish and the darkness of the sea over and above it.
  - **`There is no god but You. Glory be to You! I have done wrong."`**


## Ayat 88

- `Thereupon We accepted his prayer, and rescued him from grief.`
- **`Thus do We rescue the believers.`**

## Ayat 89

- `And We bestowed favour upon Zechariah, when he cried to his Lord:`
  - `"Lord! Leave me not solitary (without any issue).`
  - `You are the Best Inheritor."`

## Ayat 90

- `So We accepted his prayer and bestowed upon him John,`
- `and We made his wife fit1 (to bear a child).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **“Cured his wife”**: We cured his wife of sterility.
    - As **“You are the best of the Inheritors”**, I shall have no grief even if You do not give me any child.
    - (For further details, please see (Surah Aal-Imran, Ayats 37-41) and(Surah Maryam, Ayats 2-14) and the E.Ns thereof).
- `Verily they hastened in doing good works and called upon Us with longing and fear, and humbled themselves to Us.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It will be worthwhile to reiterate the reasons why the stories of the Prophets have been cited in this Surah.


## Ayat 91

- `And also recall the woman who guarded her chastity:`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Mary (peace be upon her).
- `We breathed into her of Our spirit,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It should be noted that the incident of the birth of Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) was not different from that of Prophet Adam, because the wording of the Arabic text in the two cases is almost identical: See (Surah Suad, Ayats 71-72).
    - Besides this in (verse 91), almost similar words have beets used in regard to the birth of Jesus (peace be upon him). See also (Surah An-Nisa, Ayat l71) and( Surah At-Tahrim, Ayat 12).
    - Allah Himself has stated that the birth of Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) was just like the birth of Prophet Adam: **In the sight of Allah, the case of the birth of Jesus is like that of Adam, whom He created out of dust and said, Be, and he was.** (Surah Aal-Imran, Ayat 59).
    - In the light of these verses, we may conclude that Allah uses words like: We breathed into him or her of Our spirit for miraculous births. For details please see (Surah An-Nisa E.Ns 212-213).
- `and made her and her son a Sign to the whole world.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, The mother and the son were not partners of God nor had any share whatsoever in Godhead, but were a sign from among the signs of God. See (Surah Maryam, E.N. 21).

## Ayat 92

- **`Verily this community of yours is a single community,`**
- **`and I am your Lord; so worship Me.`**

## Ayat 93

- `But they tore asunder their faith into many parts.`
- **`But to Us they are bound to return.`**
- 
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In this verse, the addressees are the entire mankind.
  - It means: O mankind, in reality all of you belonged to one community and had one and the same religion and all the Prophets brought one and the same creed which was this: Allah alone is the Lord of all mankind, therefore they should worship Him alone.
  - But afterwards the people corrupted this creed and invented and adopted the things they liked and mixed their own theories, whims and practices in it.
  - This brought into being countless communities and religions. Thus it is absolutely wrong to say that a particular Prophet was the founder of a particular religion and another of another, and so on. 
  - The very fact that different religions came into being at different periods of time, does not prove that the Prophets created these differences.
  - It is obvious that the Prophets of God could not found different religions nor could they teach their followers to worship any beings other than Allah.
