**Ayat  01 - 10**

## Ayat 01

- `The time of people's reckoning has drawn near,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **“Draws near for mankind their reckoning”:**
      - *the time of Resurrection.*
    - This is to warn the people that the time of Resurrection when they will have to appear before their Lord to render their accounts is not far.
    - This was because the coming of the Prophet (peace be upon him) was a sign and a clear evidence of the fact that mankind had entered into the last stage of its history.
    - The Prophet (peace be upon him) has himself explained it by holding out two of his adjoining fingers and said: **I have been sent at a time which joins to the time of Resurrection just as these two fingers adjoin.**
    - By this he meant to say: No other Prophet is coming between me and the Resurrection. Therefore mend your ways now, for after me no guide is coming with good news and warning.
- `and yet they turn aside in heedlessness.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they do not pay heed to any warning nor reflect on their end nor listen to the admonition of the Messenger.

## Ayat 02

- `Whenever any fresh admonition1 comes to them from their Lord`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “New revelation”: A new Surah of the Quran.
- `they barely heed it and remain immersed in play,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The words of the original text may also be interpreted as:
      - **They do not take life seriously but treat it as a sport and a joke.**

## Ayat 03

- `their hearts being set on other concerns.`
- `The wrong-doers whisper to one another:`
  - `"This person is no more than a mortal like yourselves.`
  - `Will you, then, be enchanted by sorcery while you see?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This may also be translated as:
    - **What, are you then being ensnared by his magic?**

## Ayat 04

- `He said:`
  - **`"My Lord knows well all that is spoken in the heavens and the earth.`**
  - **`He is All-Hearing, All- Knowing."`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This was the answer of the Prophet (peace be upon him) to their false propaganda and whispering campaign.
  - Instead of giving a tit for tat answer, he said: My Lord will deal with you for He hears everything and knows everything.

## Ayat 05

- `They say:`
  - `"Nay, these are confused dreams;`
  - `nay, he has forged it;`
  - `nay, he is a poet.`
  - `So let him bring us a sign, even as the Messengers of the past were sent with signs."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The background of this verse is this:
    - When the message of the Prophet (peace be upon him) started gaining adherents, the chiefs of Makkah decided among themselves to start a propaganda campaign to counteract it.
    - For this purpose they decided that every visitor to Makkah for pilgrimage should be approached and his mind so poisoned against the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he does not even go near and listen to him. Though this campaign continued throughout the year, in the pilgrimage season specially a large number of men were deputed to go to the tents of the pilgrims to warn them to beware of the Prophet (peace be upon him).
    - Different sorts of things were said against the Prophet (peace be upon him) during these talks. Sometimes it was said that he was a sorcerer or that he had fabricated the Quran by himself but attributed it to Allah. Some would say that his revelations were the words of an insane person and a bundle of incoherent ideas. Others would say that these were ordinary poetic ideas which were being dubbed as the words of Allah.
    - All they wanted to do was to poison the minds of the visitors irrespective of the correctness of their own versions. They had no considered and definite opinion in the matter.

## Ayat 06

- `Not one township that We destroyed before them believed.`
- `Would they, then, believe?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This contains a concise answer to the demand for a sign in the previous verse.

## Ayat 07

- `(O Muhammad), even before you We never sent any other than human beings as Messengers, and to them We sent revelation.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the answer to their objection: This man is no more than a human being like yourselves, and therefore, cannot be a Messenger of God. They have been told that the former Prophets, too, whom you also recognize as Prophets, were human beings and were blessed with revelations from Allah.
- `Ask the People of the Book2 if you do not know.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you may have it testified by the Jews, who are the enemies of Islam like you, and are teaching you the ways to oppose it, that all the Messengers including Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) were human beings.

## Ayat 08

- `We did not endow the Messengers with bodies that would need no food; nor were they immortals.`

## Ayat 09

- `Then We fulfilled the promise We had made to them:`
  - `We rescued them and those whom We wished,`
  - `and We destroyed those who exceeded all bounds.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - History not only tells us that the former Messengers were human beings but it also contains a lesson that they all received Allah’s succor as promised by Him and their enemies were completely destroyed.
  - Therefore you should seriously consider the goal for which you are heading.

## Ayat 10

- `We have bestowed upon you a Book that mentions you. Do you not understand?1`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is a comprehensive answer to the various objections which were being raised in desperation by the disbelievers of Makkah against the Quran and the Prophet (peace be upon him), as if to say:
  - What is there in this Book that you cannot understand?
  - Why don’t you consider it in the right spirit?
  - There is nothing contradictory in it.
  - It discusses you and your own problems and affairs of life.
  - It describes your own nature, origin and end.
  - It discriminates between good and evil and presents high moral qualities which your own consciences endorse and confirm.
  - Why don’t you, then, use your minds to understand this simple and easy thing?
