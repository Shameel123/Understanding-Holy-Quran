**Ayat  51 - 75**

## Ayat 51

- `Surely We had bestowed wisdom upon Abraham even earlier,`
- `and We knew him well.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Arabic word rushd is very comprehensive and means righteousness as well.

## Ayat 52

- `Recall,`
- `when he said to his father and his people:`
  - `"What are these images to which you are devoutly clinging?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Before proceeding further, it should be kept in mind that the incident from the history of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) has been cited here to refute the erroneous creeds of the Quraish.
  - This was meant to hit them hard for they were the descendants of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) and were proud of their relationship with him.
  - It was he who had built the Kabah which had become the center of the entire Arabia and they, being its keepers, were its most important clan. Therefore, they could not remain indifferent to this answer.

## Ayat 53

- `They answered:`
  - `"We found our fathers worshipping them."`

## Ayat 54

- `He said:`
  - `"Certainly you and your fathers have all been in manifest error."`

## Ayat 55

- `They said:`
  - `"Are you expressing your true ideas before us or are you jesting?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The literal translation will be:
    -  **Are you presenting the truth before us, or just playing with us?**
  - They were so sure of the truth of their creed that they could never imagine that anyone could be serious in declaring it to be false.

## Ayat 56

- `He said:`
  - `"Nay, but your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth which He created and to that I bear witness before you.`

## Ayat 57

- `By Allah, I shall certainly carry out my plan against your gods after you are gone."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, if you do not understand this by argument, I will present a practical proof that these idols are helpless and have no powers. 
  - Therefore, it is wrong to make them your deities.

## Ayat 58

- `Then he broke them all into pieces,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This was that practical proof. In the absence of the priests and attendants, Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) entered their central Temple and broke all the idols to pieces.
- `sparing only the supreme one among them`
- `that they may possibly return to him.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The pronoun in the original text may be translated into it or him.
  - In the former case, it will refer to the chief idol and in the latter to Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him).
  - In the first case, it will imply a subtle sarcasm in order to make them realize that their creed of idol worship was foolish, for obviously the chief idol could not break the minor idols.
  - In the second case, it will refer to Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him), who thought that they might turn to him about the incident and he might get an opportunity to have a frank talk with them about their absurd creed.

## Ayat 59

- `(When they saw the idols in this state) they said:`
  - `"Who has done this to our gods?`
  - `Surely he is one of the wrong-doers."`

## Ayat 60

- `Some of them said:`
  - `"We heard a youth called Abraham speak (ill) of them."`

## Ayat 61

- `The others said:`
  - `"Bring him, then, before the eyes of the people that they may see (what will be done to him)."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This was exactly what Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) expected to happen.
  - He wished that the matter should not remain confined to the priests and the attendants but the common people also should be present there to witness that their deities were helpless and their priests were deluding them about their powers.
  - The priests committed the same folly as was later committed by Pharaoh when he arranged an encounter between Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) and the magicians in the open in front of the multitudes of the common people, and the former got an opportunity to show publicly the miracle of the staff which shattered the illusory, magical tricks of the magicians.


## Ayat 62

- `(On Abraham's arrival) they said:`
  - `"Abraham, are you he who has done this to our gods?"`

## Ayat 63

- `He answered:`
  - `"Rather it was this supreme one who has done it.`
  - `So ask them, if they can speak."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The very sentence, “So ask them, if they can speak”, is a clear proof that it was not a lie when Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) said: **“But this has done it, biggest of them, this one”**.
  - What he intended by this was to make them realize and confess that their idols were helpless because they could do nothing to protect themselves and could not even speak.
  - It is clear that when a person poses an unreal question for the sake of argument in order to bring home the fact that the position taken by the other party is untenable, it cannot be considered as a lie;
  - firstly, because the speaker himself never intended it to be a lie, and secondly, because the addressees also knew that it was not a lie.

## Ayat 64

- `Thereupon they turned to their (inner) selves and said (to themselves):`
  - `"Surely it is you who are the wrong-doers."`

## Ayat 65

- `Then their minds were turned upside down, and they said:`
  - `"You know well that they do not speak."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Literally the original text means:
    - **They were turned down upon their heads.**
  - Some commentators have interpreted it to mean: They hung down their heads with shame. But this does not fit in the context and the wording of the text. The right interpretation would be: When they considered the answer of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him), they realized that they themselves were in the wrong, because they had set up helpless idols as deities, which could not even speak a word as to who had broken them. But soon after this, they were overpowered by obduracy and ignorance which perverted their minds and they again relapsed into crookedness.

## Ayat 66

- `Abraham said:`
  - `"Do you, then, worship beside Allah a thing that can neither benefit you nor hurt you?`

## Ayat 67

- `Fie upon you and upon all that you worship beside Allah.`
- `Do you have no sense?"`

## Ayat 68

- `They said:`
  - `"Burn him, and come to the support of your gods,`
  - `if you are going to do anything."`

## Ayat 69

- `We said:`
  - `"O fire, become coolness and safety for Abraham."1`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Though this is one of those miracles which have been clearly stated in the Quran, there are people who try to prove that there was no such miracle at all.
  - According to this passage (Ayats 68-70), Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) was actually threatened to be burnt alive and he was accordingly thrown into the burning fire, but Allah ordered the fire to become cool and harmless for him.
  - In the face of the clear words of the Quran, these people deny this miracle because according to them it is impossible even for Allah to go beyond the routine of the physical laws. They say that miracles cannot appeal to the rationalists of the modern age, and therefore these should be interpreted in accordance with physical laws. They forget that according to the Quran, Allah is able to do everything, and He does extraordinary and unusual things which cannot be explained by science. Therefore they should accept the Quran as it is or discard it, but they should not twist it to suit their so called rationalism.


## Ayat 70

- `They had sought to do evil to him,`
- `but We caused them to be the worst losers,`

## Ayat 71

- `and We saved him and Lot`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - According to the Bible, Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) had two brothers, Nahor and Haran; Prophet Lot was the son of Haran
      - (Gen. 11:26),
    - and he was the only person to believe in Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him).
      - (Surah Al-Ankaboot, Ayat 26).
- `and brought him to the land upon which We had bestowed Our blessings for all the people of the world.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The blessed land refers to Syria and Palestine, which contains both material and spiritual blessings.
    - It is one of the most fertile regions in the world. Moreover, it was blessed for two thousand years with more Prophets than any other region of the world.

## Ayat 72

- `And We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob as an additional gift,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, We made his son a Prophet and his grandson too.
- `making each of them righteous.`

## Ayat 73

- `And We made them into leaders to guide people in accordance with Our command,`
- `and We inspired them to good works, and to establish Prayers and to give Zakah.`
- `They worshipped Us alone.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This important event of the life of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) has found no mention whatever in the Bible.
    - In fact nothing about his life in Iraq, his conflict with Nimrod, his father and the community at large, his efforts to eradicate idolatry, the incident of his being cast into the fire, which ultimately led to his forced exile from the country, is mentioned anywhere in the Bible.
    - The Bible merely mentions his migration, and that too, in a manner as if a family was migrating from one country to another in search of livelihood.
    - There is another interesting difference between the Quran and the Bible. According to the Quran, the father of Abraham, who was a mushrik, was foremost in tyrannizing over his son, but the Bible gives a different account, which is as follows.

## Ayat 74

- `We bestowed upon Lot sound judgement and knowledge,`
- `and We delivered him from the city that was immersed in foul deeds.`
- `They were indeed a wicked people, exceedingly disobedient.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The original Arabic word hukm is very comprehensive. 
  - It means judgment, wisdom and discretion, and authority from Allah. 
  - Ilm stands for the revealed knowledge of the truth. Thus, We bestowed hukm and ilm on Lot. We appointed Lot as a Prophet.
  - (For the story of Lot, see (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 80-84); (Suran Younus, Ayats 70-83); (Surah Al-Hijr, Ayats 57-74 )and the E.Ns there of).

## Ayat 75

- `And We admitted him into Our mercy. Verily he was of the righteous.`
