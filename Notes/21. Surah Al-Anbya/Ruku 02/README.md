**Ayat  11 - 29**


## Ayat 11

- `How many a wrong-doing town did We shatter and then raise up another people.`

## Ayat 12

- `Then, when they perceived Our chastisement`
- `they took to their heels and fled.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, when they realized that Allah’s scourge was actually coming.

## Ayat 13

- `(They were told):`
  - `"Flee not, but return to your comforts and to your dwellings.`
  - `You are likely to be questioned."`

## Ayat 14

- `They said:`
  - `"Woe to us; surely we were wrong-doers."`

## Ayat 15

- `They did not cease to cry this until We reduced them to stubble, still and silent.`

## Ayat 16

- `We did not create in sport the heavens and the earth and all that lies between the two.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This was to refute their entire conception of life which was based on the assumption that man was free to do whatever he liked, and there was none to call him to account or take him to task: that there was no life in the Hereafter where one’s good deeds would be rewarded and evil deeds punished.
  - In other words, this meant that the whole universe had been created without any serious purpose and therefore there was no need to pay any heed to the message of the Prophet.

## Ayat 17

- `Had it been Our will to find a pastime,`
- `We would have found one near at hand;`
- `if at all We were inclined to do so.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, this world has been created with a definite purpose and not as a plaything.
  - For, if We had wanted to enjoy a sport, We would have done so without creating a sentient, rational and responsible creature like you.
  - Far be it from Us to put man to trial and conflict for the sake of mere fun.

## Ayat 18

- `Nay, We hurl the Truth at falsehood so that the Truth crushes falsehood, and lo! it vanishes.`
- `Woe to you for what you utter!`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the object for which this world has been created is to stage a conflict between the truth and falsehood.
  - And you yourselves know that in this conflict falsehood has always been defeated and destroyed.
  - You should, therefore, consider this reality seriously.
  - For, if you build the system of your life on the false presumption that it is mere fun, you will meet with the same consequences as the former people did, who presumed that the world was a mere show and pastime.
  - Therefore you should reconsider your whole attitude towards the message which has come to you.
  - Instead of making fun of it and scoffing at the Messenger, you should take a warning from the fate of the former peoples.

## Ayat 19

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - From here begins the discourse on the confirmation of Tauhid and the refutation of shirk for these were the actual bases of the conflict between the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the disbelievers of Makkah.
  - The line of argument is this: The whole system of the universe is a clear proof that there is One Allah Who is its Creator, Sovereign, Ruler, and Lord and it is a falsehood that there are many gods who are partners in His Kingdom and Sovereignty, or that there is a Supreme God Who has under Him some minor gods to conduct the affairs of His Kingdom.
  - This proof is also based on the preceding verses in which it has been stated that the universe has not been created as a pastime or a plaything, but for a serious purpose and that there has always been a conflict between the truth and falsehood, and falsehood has always been defeated and destroyed.

- `To Him belongs whosoever dwells in the heavens and on earth.`
- `Those (angels) that are with Him`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the angels whom the mushriks of Arabia believed to be the children of God and worshiped them as partners in Godhead.
- `neither disdain to serve Him out of pride, nor do they weary of it.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they are engaged in His service day and night without grumbling or ever feeling wearied.

## Ayat 20

- `They glorify Him night and day, without flagging.`

## Ayat 21

- `Have they taken earthly gods who are such that they raise up the dead to life?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This question has been posed to bring home to the disbelievers that when they themselves believed that there is no being other than Allah who can give life to inanimate matter, why do they then acknowledge other deities besides Allah?

## Ayat 22

- `Had there been any gods in the heavens and the earth apart from Allah, the order of both the heavens and the earth would have gone to ruins.`
- **`Glory be to Allah, the Lord of the Throne,`**
- `Who is far above their false descriptions of Him.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This concise sentence contains two arguments:
    1. The obviously simple argument is that no institution, no household, not to speak of the vast universe containing multitudes of countless distant stars, can function smoothly and properly, if it has two masters.


## Ayat 23
 
 - **`None shall question Him about what He does,`**
 - **`but they shall be questioned.`**

## Ayat 24

- `Have they taken gods other than Him?`
- `Say, (O Muhammad):`
  - `"Bring forth your proof!`
  - `Here is the Book with admonition for those of my time and there are also scriptures with admonition for people before me."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The first two were rational arguments and this is a historical one. This means that the study of all the former Scriptures shows that the Creator of the universe is One Allah and He alone is worthy of service and worship, while your religion is neither supported by rational arguments nor by historical evidence.
- ` But most people do not know the Truth, and have, therefore, turned away from it.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - It is their lack of the knowledge of the reality which has created this indifference towards the message of the Prophet, and the same has made them heedless of the message.

## Ayat 25

- `Never did We send any Messenger before you to whom We did not reveal:`
  - **`"There is no god but Me. So serve Me alone."`**

## Ayat 26


- `They say: "The Most Compassionate Lord has taken to Himself a son."`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here it refers to the angels as is clear from Ayat
- **`Glory be to Him!`**
- `Those whom they so designate are only His honoured servants.`

## Ayat 27

- `They do not outstrip Him in speech and only act as He commands.`

## Ayat 28

- `He knows whatever is before them and whatsoever is remote from them`
- `and they do not intercede except for him, intercession on whose behalf pleases Him,`
- `and they stand constantly in awe of Him.`

## Ayat 29

- `And if anyone of them were to claim:`
  - `"Indeed I am a god apart from Him,"`
- `We shall recompense both with Hell.`
- `Thus do We recompense the wrong-doers.`
