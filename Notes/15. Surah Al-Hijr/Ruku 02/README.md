**Ayat 16 - 25**

## Ayat 16

- `We have indeed set constellations in the heavens`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In the preceding( Ayats 14-15) it was stated that the disbelievers had become so hardened against the Quran that they would not have believed in it even if they had ascended the Heaven and seen with their own eyes the signs mentioned in it.
    - Now in (Ayats 16-22), some of the signs are being cited in order to convince there of its truth.
- `and have beautified them for the beholders,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Buruj (mansions of stars) are signs of Allah.
    - For it is not possible to pass through one sphere of the Heaven into another, as each sphere of the space has been fortified by invisible boundaries.
    - In this connection, it may be noted that literally the Arabic word burj means a fortified place, but as a technical term of ancient astronomy this stood for each of the twelve signs of the Zodiac, which marked the sunâ€™s path through the heavens. 
    - This has led some of the commentators to form the opinion that in this verse the word buruj refers to the same. But there are some others who think that it means stars or planets. However, if we consider this word in the context of (Ayat 19), we are led to the conclusion that probably it stands for spheres.

## Ayat 17

- `and have protected them against every accursed satan`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, these spheres are so fortified that they are beyond the reach of every Satan, for all Satans including those of jinns, have been confined to that sphere in which the Earth has been placed and they enjoy no more access to visit other spheres than the other dwellers of this sphere.
  - This has been mentioned in order to remove a common misunderstanding.
  - The common people believed, and still believe, that Satan and his descendants have a free access to every place in the universe.
  - **On the contrary, the Quran says that Satans cannot go beyond a certain limit and they have no unlimited power of ascension**.

## Ayat 18

- `save him who may eavesdrop,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the answer to the false claim of the soothsayers, diviners, hermits, conjurers and the like who pretended to receive communications from the Heaven.
    - The Quran says that in fact they do not possess any means of obtaining information about unseen things. Satans, however, try to eaves-drop because they are by nature more like angels than human beings, but in reality, they succeed in obtaining very little information about it.
- `and then a bright flame pursues him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In Arabic the word shihab-i-mubin literally means a fiery flame.
    - In Surah (As-Saffaat, Ayat 10), the same thing has been called shihab-i-thaqib (flame that pierces through darkness). This may or may not necessarily be a meteor for it is just possible that it may be some type of rays such as cosmic rays or even a stronger type which we have not been able to discover as yet. Anyhow, if the fiery flame that pursues Satans may be taken to be a meteor, a countless number of these can form a fortification around our sphere of the universe. Scientific observations made with the help of the telescope have shown that billions of these meteors are rushing from space in a mass of rainfall. towards the earth's atmosphere. Such a scene was witnessed in an eastern pan of North America on November 13, 1833.

## Ayat 19

- `As for the earth,`
- `We have stretched it out and have cast on it firm mountains,`
- `and have caused to grow in it everything well-measured.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The growth of every kind of plant in a limited extent is another sign of the wisdom and power of Allah.
  - For the generative power of every vegetable plant is so great that if free growth had been allowed to even one kind of plant, it would have covered the whole surface of the earth.
  - But it is by the design of the All-Wise and All-Powerful Creator that every kind of vegetable is produced in a balanced measure.
  - There is another aspect of the vegetable life. Each and every kind of it is allowed to grow only to a fixed size, height, and thickness, which is a proof of the fact that the Creator himself prescribed the structure, the shape, the size, the height, the leaves and branches, and the number of each and every plant, and no plant is allowed to go beyond any of these fixed limits.

## Ayat 20

- `And We have provided sustenance for you on it`
- `and also for those of whom you are not the providers.`

## Ayat 21

- `There is nothing except that its treasuries are with Us`
- `and We do not send it down except in a known measure.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is to bring home the fact that it is not vegetable life alone that has a fixed limit to its growth, etc.
  - The same is true of everything that exists, whether it be air, water, light, heat, cold, mineral, vegetable, animal or power or energy, in short, each and every thing exists in the prescribed quantity, number, etc. which neither decreases nor increases.
  - It is this determined course in each and every thing which has produced appropriate balance and proportion in the entire system of the universe to such a perfection that one is led to the inevitable conclusion that the whole thing has been designed by its All-Wise Creator.
  - For, had the universe come into existence by mere accident or had it been created by many gods, it was impossible to have such a perfect balance and appropriate proportion with perpetual consistence in so many different things and powers.
