**Ayat 61 - 79**

## Ayat 61

- `So when the envoys came to the household of Lot,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Please compare this with (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 80-84) and (Surah Houd, Ayats 77-83).

## Ayat 62

- `he said:`
  - `"Surely you are an unknown folk."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here the story has been related in brief.
  - But we learn from(Surah Houd, Ayats 77-83) that Prophet Lot (peace be upon him) was greatly perturbed and distressed at the visit of the angels.
  - He said to himself, **“This is a day of woe.”**
  - The reason why he was distressed, as implied in the Quran and explicitly expressed in the traditions, was that the angels had come to Prophet Lot (peace be upon him) in the form of beautiful boys, and he knew how perverse and wicked his people were.
  - He was distressed for he could not send them away because they were his guests, and because he did not know how to protect them from those villains.

## Ayat 63

- `They said:`
  - `"Nay, we have brought to you that concerning which they have been in doubt.`

## Ayat 64

- `We truly tell you that we have brought to you the Truth.`

## Ayat 65

- `So set out with your family in a watch of the night,`
- `and keep yourself behind them,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you should walk behind your people lest anyone of them should stay behind.
- `and no one of you may turn around,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It did not mean: “look not behind thee, lest thou be consumed,” as stated in the Bible.
    - But it merely meant to warn them: None of you should turn round to see what was happening behind them lest you should stop to see when you heard the cries of the smitten people.
    - For it is neither the time nor the place viewing the destruction nor shedding tears of regret.
    - If you stop even for a minute in the territory of the smitten people you also might get hurt from the rain of stones.
- `and keep going ahead as you have been commanded."`

## Ayat 66

- `And We communicated to him the decree that by the morning those people will be totally destroyed.`

## Ayat 67

- `In the meantime the people of the city came to Lot rejoicing.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This shows that those People had gone to the lowest depths of immorality.
    - No sooner did they hear the news of the arrival of handsome strangers in their town than they rushed rejoicing to the house of Prophet Lot (peace be upon him) and impudently demanded that he should hand over his guests to them for the gratification of their lust.
    - The pity is that there had remained not a single person among them to make a protest against such a heinous sin.
    - Moreover, this shows that all of them, as a community, had totally lost every sense of decency, and they felt no shame at all to make such a wicked demand on him openly.
    - The very fact, that they felt no hesitation in making such a wicked demand brazen facedly from a pious and holy man like Prophet Lot (peace be upon him), shows that the heinous crime was so common among them that they would not spare anyone.

## Ayat 68

- `He said:`
  - `"These are my guests, so do not disgrace me.`

## Ayat 69

- `Have fear of Allah, and do not humiliate me."`

## Ayat 70

- `They replied:`
  - `"Did we not forbid you again and again to extend hospitality to all and sundry?"`

## Ayat 71

- `Lot exclaimed in exasperation:`
  - `"If you are bent on doing something, then here are my daughters."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In (E.N. 87 of Surah Houd), it has been explained what Prophet Lot (peace be upon him) meant by this.
  - It may also be added that such words as these were uttered by an honorable man like him in the last resort, when all his entreaties and earnest requests had failed to prevent those people from their evil designs towards his guests.

## Ayat 72

- `By your life, (O Prophet), they went about blindly stumbling in their intoxication.`

## Ayat 73

- `Then the mighty Blast caught them at sunrise,`

## Ayat 74

- `and turned the land upside down,`
- `and rained down stones of baked clay.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - These “stones of baked clay” might have been meteoric showers or volcanic eruptions that flew and rained upon them, or these might have been blown by a strong wind.

## Ayat 75

- `There are great Signs in this for those endowed with intelligence.`

## Ayat 76

- `The place (where this occurred) lies along a known route.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, that smitten territory lies on the high road from Hijaz (Arabia) to Syria and Egypt.
  - Travelers come across these signs of destruction which are very prominent in the territory that lies to the southeast of the Dead Sea. 
  - The geographers are of the opinion that there is no other land on the surface of the Earth which looks desolate as this territory, especially its southern part.

## Ayat 77

- `Verily there is a Sign in this for the believers.`

## Ayat 78

- `And the people of Aykah were also wrong-doers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The people of Al-Aikah were the community of Prophet Shuaib (peace be upon him) and were called Midianites after the name of their capital city and their territory.
  - As regards Al-Aikah, it was the ancient name of Tabuk and literally means a thick forest.

## Ayat 79

- `So We chastised them.`
- `The desolate locations of both communities lie on a well-known highway.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Midian lay on the route from Hijaz to Palestine and Syria.
