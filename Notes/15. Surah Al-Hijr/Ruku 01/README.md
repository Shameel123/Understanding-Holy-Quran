**Ayat 01 - 15**

## Ayat 01

- `Alif. Lam. Ra'.`
- `These are the verses of the Book,`
- `and a Clear Qur'an.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse is the brief introduction to the Surah, and immediately after this begins its theme.
  - “These are the verses of the Book and a clear Quran”:
    - These are the verses of that Quran which makes its meaning lucid and understandable.

## Ayat 02

- `Soon will the time come when the unbelievers will wish they were Muslims.`

## Ayat 03

- `Leave them to eat and enjoy life and let false hopes amuse them.`
- `They will soon come to know.`

## Ayat 04

- `Whenever We destroyed a town, a definite term had previously been decreed for it.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is to refute the fallacious argument of the disbelievers that Muhammad (peace be upon him) was not a true Prophet because they had received no prompt punishment for their disbelief.
  - It is like this: We have never seized a community at the first committal of kufr.

## Ayat 05

- `No people can outstrip the term for its destruction nor can it delay it.`

## Ayat 06

- `They say:`
  - `"O you to whom the Admonition has been revealed,`
  - `you are surely crazed.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The word zikr literally means “to cause to remember”, “to caution” and “to give advice”.
  - But the Quran has used it as a technical term for “admonition”, which comes as a precept.
  - Thus all the Books that had been sent down to the Messengers were zikr, and the Quran is also zikr.

## Ayat 07

- `Why do you not bring down angels upon us if you are indeed truthful?"`

## Ayat 08

- `We do not send down the angels (in frivolity);`
- `and when We do send them down,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This was a sarcastic remark that was made by the opponents, for they did not acknowledge that the admonition had been sent down to the Prophet (peace be upon him): otherwise they could not say that he was insane.
    - What they really meant by this remark was: You, who claim that the admonition has been sent down to you, are insane.
    - A similar remark was also made by Pharaoh concerning Prophet Moses (peace be upon him). Addressing his courtiers, he said: The Messenger who has been sent to you is insane. (Surah Ash-Shuara, Ayat 27).
- `We do so with Truth;`
- `then people are granted no respite.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “We do not send down the angels.”
    - We do not send down the angels for the mere fun of it in response to the request of the people, nor are they sent to unveil the reality before them in order to show to them all the unseen things to which the Messengers invite them to believe.
    - As a matter of fact, angels are sent down on that occasion when it is decreed to pass judgment on sane wicked people.
    - At that time the judgment comes into operation without extending any invitation to the condemned people to accept the message, for their period of respite ends as soon as the reality is unveiled before them. “Except with truth.”

## Ayat 09

- `As for the Admonition,`
- `indeed it is We Who have revealed it and`
- `it is indeed We Who are its guardians.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, you should note it well that it is We Who have sent down this zikr.
  - Thus it is not Our Messenger whom you are calling insane but in fact this abusive remark applies to Us.
  - Moreover, you should know that it is Our Word and We are preserving it.
  - Therefore, you can do no harm to it, nor can you discredit it by your ridicules, taunts and objections, nor can you hamper its progress.
  - Whatever you may do against it, no one will ever be able to change or tamper with it.

## Ayat 10

- `(O Muhammad),`
- `certainly We did send Messengers before you among the nations which have gone by.`

## Ayat 11

- `And whenever a Messenger came to them, they never failed to mock him.`

## Ayat 12

- `Even so We make a way for it (that is, the Admonition) in the hearts of the culprits (like a hot rod);`

## Ayat 13

- `they do not believe in it.`
- `This has been the wont of people of this kind from ancient times.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The majority of the translators and commentators are of the opinion that the pronoun “it”( Ayat 12), refers to their mockery, occurring in (Ayat 11), and in “they would not believe in it” in(Ayat 13), refers to the admonition occurring in (Ayat 9). Then (Ayats 12-13) will be rendered like this:
    - “Thus we cause mockery enter into the hearts of the criminals and they do not believe in the admonition”.
  - Though grammatically there is nothing wrong with this version, yet our version of “it” will be better even grammatically. According to this (Ayat 12) will mean, when the admonition enters into the hearts of the believers it gives them peace of mind and comfort of heart. But when the same enters into the hearts of the criminals it becomes a hot rod, and burns their minds and hearts.

## Ayat 14

- `If We were even to open for them a way to the heavens, and they could continually climb up to it in broad daylight,`

## Ayat 15

- `they would still have said:`
  - `"Surely our eyes have been dazzled; rather, we have been enchanted."`
