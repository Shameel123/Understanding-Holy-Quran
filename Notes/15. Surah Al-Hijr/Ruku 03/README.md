**Ayat 26 - 44**

## Ayat 26

- `Surely We brought man into being out of dry ringing clay which was wrought from black mud,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Arabic word salsal means the dried clay which produces a sound like pottery.

## Ayat 27

- `while We had brought the jinn into being before out of blazing fire.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - As samum is not wind, nar-i-samum will mean flame of intense heat and not of fire. 
  - This is the explanation of those passages in which it has been stated that jinns have been created from fire.

## Ayat 28

- `Recall when your Lord said to the angels:`
  - `"I will indeed bring into being a human being out of dry ringing clay wrought from black mud.`

## Ayat 29

- `When I have completed shaping him and have breathed into him of My Spirit,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “And have breathed into him of My Spirit” means when I have cast a reflection of My divine characteristics on him.
    - This shows that the soul of man implies life, knowledge, power, will, discretion and other human characteristics in the aggregate.
    - These are in reality a slight reflection of divine characteristics that has been cast on the human body, which was originally created from dried clay.
    - And it is this divine reflection on the human body which has raised him to the position of the vicegerent of Allah and made him that worthy being before whom angels and every earthly thing should bow down.
- `then fall you down before him in prostration."`

## Ayat 30

- `So, the angels - all of them - fell down in prostration,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Please compare this passage (Ayats 30-43) with (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayats 30-39); (Surah An-Nisa, Ayats 117-120); and(Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 11-25) and also refer to E.Ns appended to these Ayats.

## Ayat 31

- `except Iblis;`
- `he refused to join those who prostrated.`


## Ayat 32

  - `"Iblis!`
  - `What is the matter with you that you did not join those who prostrated?"`

## Ayat 33

- `He said:`
  - `"It does not behove of me to prostrate myself before a human being whom You have created out of dry ringing clay wrought from black mud."`

## Ayat 34

- `The Lord said:`
  - `"Then get out of here; you are rejected,`

## Ayat 35

- `and there shall be a curse upon you till the Day of Recompense."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, you shall remain accursed up to the Resurrection.
  - Then you shall be punished for your disobedience on the Day of Judgment.

## Ayat 39

- `Iblis said:`
  - `"My Lord!`
  - `In the manner You led me to error, I will make things on earth seem attractive to them`
  - `and lead all of them to error,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, thou hast beguiled me by commanding me to bow down before a creature who is inferior to me: for it is obvious that I could not obey such an order. Therefore, I will now beguile them and disobey Thee.
  - In other words, Iblis meant to say: I will make the worldly life, its enjoyments and its transitory benefits so alluring for man that he will forget the responsibilities of the vicegerent of Allah, and that he shall have to render his account in the Hereafter. 
  - They will also forget Thee and will disobey Thee, even though they would profess to remember Thee.

## Ayat 40

- `except those of Your servants whom You have singled out for Yourself."`

## Ayat 41

- `Allah said:`
  - `"Here is the path that leads straight to Me.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This (verse 41) may have another meaning: This is the right thing: I also will stick to this.

## Ayat 42

- `Over My true servants you will be able to exercise no power,`
- `your power will be confined to the erring ones, those who choose to follow you.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This (verse 42) also may have another meaning: You will have no power over My servants (common people) to force them to disobey Me. However, We will give freedom of action to those who will willingly or deliberately follow you, and we will not forcibly prevent them from your way, if they intended to follow you.

## Ayat 43

- `Surely Hell is the promised place for all of them."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In order to comprehend the purpose for which the story of Prophet Adam and Satan has been related here, we should keep in mind the context in which this has occurred.
  - In the preceding (verses 1-25), it has been stated that the disbelievers were following the ways of deviation that would lead them to perdition.
  - This story has been related to warn them that the ways they were following were the ways of Satan, their eternal enemy, so as to say: You should realize the consequences of following Satan, who has enticed you in this snare, and is leading you to the lowest depths of degradation because of this enmity and envy.
  - In contrast to this, Our Prophet is doing his utmost to free you from his snare and lead you to the height of success, which as a man you should desire to achieve.
  - But it is a pity that you are regarding your enemy (Satan) as your friend, and your friend (Our Prophet) as your enemy.

## Ayat 44

- `There are seven gates in it, and to each gate a portion of them has been allotted.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Sinners will be divided into different groups in accordance with their different sins for their entry into Hell from seven different gates specified for each different sin.
  - For instance, the group of atheists shall enter into Hell by one of the seven gates specified for their group.
  - Likewise, mushriks, hypocrites, self-seekers, sensualists, tyrants, propagandists and leaders of disbelief etc. shall each enter into Hell through the gates specified for their group.
