**Ayat 20 - 28**

## Ayat 20

- `The believers used to say:`
  - `“Why is a surah (that would ordain fighting) not revealed?”`
- `But when a definitive surah was revealed wherein fighting was mentioned, you saw that those in whose hearts there was a sickness looked at you as though they were about to faint at the approach of death.`
- `Pity on them!`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, in view of the conditions through which the Muslims were passing and the attitude that the disbelievers had adopted towards Islam and the Muslims at that time, the believers were generally of the opinion that they should be permitted to fight even before fighting was actually enjoined by Allah. Rather they were asking Allah’s command in this regard impatiently and were asking again and again: Why are we not permitted to fight these wicked people?
  - But the condition of the people who had joined the ranks of the Muslims hypocritically was quite different from that of the believers. They held their lives and their properties as dearer to themselves than Allah and His religion, and were not prepared to risk them at any cost. Therefore, as soon as fighting was enjoined, they were clearly sorted out from the true believers.
  - Until the time when fighting had not been enjoined, the hypocrites and the common believers could not be distinguished one from the other. The hypocrites offered the Prayer just as the true believers did, they observed the Fast just like them, and practiced every article of the faith as made no demand of a sacrifice on them. But when the time came for making the supreme sacrifice of life for the sake of Islam, their hypocrisy was exposed and their veil of false display of the faith was rent asunder.
  - In Surah An-Nisa, their this state has been described thus: **Have you marked those to whom it was said: Withhold your hands a while and establish the salat and pay the zakat? Now that the fighting has been enjoined for them, some of them fear the people as they should fear Allah, or even more than that. They say: Our Lord, why have You enjoined fighting for us? Why have You not given us a brief respite?** (verse 77)

## Ayat 21

- `(They keep affirming their) obedience and saying good words.`
- `But when a course of action was clearly determined, it would have been better for them if they had proved true to Allah.`

## Ayat 22

- `Now, if you were to turn away,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Another translation of the words in the original can be: If you became rulers over the people,
- `what else can be expected but that you will work corruption in the land and fly at each other's throats?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Its one meaning is: If at this time you shirk supporting and defending Islam and refrain from fighting with your life and wealth for the cause of the great reformist revolution which the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companions are struggling to bring about. There will be no other consequence of this than that you would return to the same system of ignorance in which you have been cutting each other’s throat since centuries, burying your children alive and filling God’s earth with injustice and wickedness.
    - Its other meaning is: You are a people of depraved character. You are not at all sincere in your claim of having affirmed the faith, because you are not prepared to make any sacrifice in its cause. Now, if Allah gives you power in the land and entrusts the affairs of the world to you when morally you are unsound and unreliable, what else can be expected of you than that you would commit tyranny and mischief and resort to killing of your own near and dear ones.

## Ayat 23

- `It is these upon whom Allah has laid His curse:`
- `so He made them deaf and deprived them of their sight.`

## Ayat 24

Amazing Ayah! Listen to the Qirat of this...

- **`Do they, then, not reflect on the Qur'an?`**
- `Or are there locks on their hearts?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, either these people do not ponder over the Quran at all, or if they try to ponder over it, its teachings and meaning do not enter into their hearts, because they have put locks on them. As for this; “are there locks upon their hearts” means: There are such locks for them as are specially meant for the hearts which are not susceptible to the truth.


## Ayat 25

- `Certainly those who have turned their backs on the True Guidance after it became manifest to them,`
- `Satan has embellished their ways for them and has buoyed them up with false hopes.`

## Ayat 26

- `This, because they said to those who are averse to the faith that Allah has revealed:`
  - `“In some matters we shall obey you.”`
- `Allah has full knowledge of their secret parleys.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, in spite of professing the faith and being counted among the Muslims, they went on conspiring secretly with the enemies of Islam and even pledged to support them in certain matters.

## Ayat 27

- `But how will they fare when angels will take their souls at death and will carry them, striking their faces and backs?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, in the world they adopted this attitude so that they may safeguard their interests and may protect themselves from the dangers of the conflict between Islam and infidelity, but how will they escape Allah’s wrath after death? At that time, no device of theirs will prove helpful for them to remain safe from the punishment by the angels.

## Ayat 28

- `That is because they have followed a way that angered Allah, and have been averse to His good pleasure.`
- `So He reduced all their works to nought.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This refers to all those works that they performed as Muslims. Their Prayers, their Fasting, their payments of the Zakat, and all other acts of worship and virtue, which in appearance and form are counted among good works, were rendered void, for they failed to adopt the attitude of sincerity and loyalty towards Allah and Islam and the Muslim community, even though they professed to be Muslims. 
  - But, on the contrary, they went on conspiring with the enemies of Islam for the sake of small worldly gains, and started devising schemes to save themselves from any possible risks as soon as time came for Jihad in the cause of Allah.
  - These verses are absolutely decisive and conclusive in this regard that in the conflict between Islam and un-Islam the faith of the person whose sympathies are not with Islam and the Muslims, or are with disbelief and the disbelievers, cannot at all be reliable, not to speak of any of his works being acceptable before Allah.
