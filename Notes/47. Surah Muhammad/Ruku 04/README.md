**Ayat 29 - 38**

## Ayat 29

- `Or do they, in whose hearts there is a sickness, believe that Allah will not bring their failings to light?`

## Ayat 30

- `If We were to so will, We could have shown them to you so that you would recognise them by their faces, and you would certainly know them by the manner of their speech.`
- `Allah knows all your deeds.`

## Ayat 31

- `We shall certainly test you until We know those of you who truly strive and remain steadfast, and will ascertain about you.`

## Ayat 32

- `Those who disbelieved and barred others from Allah's Way and opposed the Messenger after the True Guidance had become manifest to them, they shall not be able to cause Allah the least harm;`
- `rather, Allah will reduce all their works to nought.`

## Ayat 33

- `Believers, obey Allah and obey the Messenger`
- `and do not cause your works to be nullified.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In other words, the deeds being beneficial and yielding of good results depends wholly on one's obedience to Allah and His Messenger. After one has turned away from obedience, no deed remains a good deed so that one may deserve any reward for it.


## Ayat 34

- **`Verily Allah shall not forgive those who disbelieved and barred others from Allah's Way and clung to their unbelief until their death.`**

## Ayat 35

- `So, be not faint-hearted and do not cry for peace.`
- `You shall prevail.`
- `Allah is with you and will not bring your works to nought.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here, one should bear in mind the fact that when this discourse was revealed only a handful of the Muslims consisting of a couple of hundreds of the Muhajirin and Ansar living in the small town of Madinah were upholding the standard of Islam and they were not only faced by the powerful Quraish but also by the whole of pagan Arabia. 
  - Such were the conditions when they were exhorted not to show weakness and not to beg (the enemy) for peace, but to make preparations for the decisive conflict.
  - This does not mean that the Muslims should never negotiate for peace, but it means that in a state like this it is not right to initiate peace negotiations when it shows the Muslims 'weakness, for it will still further embolden the enemy.
  - The Muslims should first establish their superiority in power and strength; then if they negotiate peace there will be no harm.


## Ayat 36

- `The life of this world is but sport and amusement.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, as against the Hereafter, this world is no more than a means of temporary entertainment. The success or failure here is not anything real and enduring, which might in any way be important. The real life is the life Hereafter, and its success should be man's main concern. (For further explanation, see (E.N. 102 of Surah Al-Ankabut).)
- `If you believe and are God-fearing, He will grant you your reward, and will not ask you for your possessions.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Allah is Self-Sufficient: He does not need taking anything from you for His own self. If He tells you to expend something in His way, He does so not for Himself but only for your own good.

## Ayat 37

- `If He were to ask you for your possessions and press you (in that regard), you would have grown niggardly,`
- `and Allah would have brought your failings to light.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, He does not put you to any severe trial that may bring out your weaknesses.

## Ayat 38

- `Behold, you are those who are called upon to spend in Allah's Way, but some of you are niggardly.`
- `Whoever is niggardly is in fact niggardly to himself.`
- `For Allah is All-Sufficient, whereas it is you who are in need of Him.`
- `If you turn away, He will replace you by a people other than you, and they will not be like you.`
