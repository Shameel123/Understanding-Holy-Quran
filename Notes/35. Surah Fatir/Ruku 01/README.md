**Ayat 01 - 08**

## Ayat 01

- `All praise be to Allah,`
- `the Fashioner of the heavens and earth,`
- `Who appointed angels as His message bearers,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This can have two meanings:
      - (1) That these angels perform the service of communicating messages between Allah and His Prophets.
      - (2) That it is the duty of these angels to convey and enforce the commands of Allah Almighty throughout the universe.
- `having two, three, four wings.`
- `He adds to His creation whatever He pleases.`
- `Verily Allah has power over everything.`

## Ayat 02

- `Whatever Mercy Allah accords to people, none can withhold; and`
- ` whatever He withholds, no other will be able to release after Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is also meant to remove the misunderstanding of the polytheists, who believed that from among the servants of Allah, someone gave them the provision, someone the children and someone health to their patients. All these superstitions of shirk are baseless, and the pure truth is just that whatever of mercy reaches the people, reaches to them only through Allah Almighty’s bounty and grace. No one else has the power either to bestow it or to withhold it. This theme has been expressed at many places in the Quran and the Ahadith in different ways so that man may avoid the humiliation of begging at every door and at every shrine and may realize that making or marring of his destiny is in the power of One Allah alone and of none else.
- `He is Most Mighty, Most Wise.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “He is the All-Mighty”: He is dominant and the owner of Sovereignty: none can stop His judgments from being enforced.
    - Also “He is All-Wise”: every act of His is based on wisdom. When He gives somebody something He gives because it is demanded by wisdom, and when He withholds something from somebody, He withholds it because it would be against wisdom to give it.

## Ayat 03

- `O people, remember Allah's favour upon you.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Remember Allah’s favor upon you”: Do not be ungrateful: do not forget that whatever you have, has been given by Allah. In other words, this sentence is meant to warn that whoever worships other than Allah, or regards a blessing as a favor done by other than Allah, or thanks other than Allah for a favor received, or prays to other than Allah for the grant of a blessing, is ungrateful.
- `Is there any creator, apart from Allah, who provides you your sustenance out of the heavens and earth?`
- `There is no god but He.`
- `Whither are you, then, being misdirected?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There is a subtle gap between the first and the second sentence, which is being filled by the context itself. To understand this, one may visualize the scene like this: The polytheists are being addressed. The speaker asks the audience: “Is there another creator beside Allah, who might have created you, and might be arranging provisions for you from the earth and heavens?” After this question the speaker waits for the answer. But there is no reply from anywhere. No one replies that there is another one beside Allah, who is their creator and sustainer. This by itself shows that the audience also believe that there is none beside Allah, who could be their creator and sustainer. Then the speaker says: “If so, then He alone can also be the Deity and no one else. How have you been so deceived? Why have you taken these others as your deities, when Allah alone is your Creator and Sustainer?”

## Ayat 04

- `(O Prophet), (there is nothing novel in it) if they cry lies to you;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “If they deny”: If they do not believe that there is no one worthy of worship but Allah, and accuse you of having made a false claim to Prophethood.
- `Messengers before you were also cried lies to.`
- `To Allah shall all matters be sent back.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it is not for the people to give the verdict that whomsoever they call a liar should in fact become a liar. The judgment rests with Allah. He shall in the end decide who was the liar, and shall bring the real liars to their evil end.


## Ayat 05

- `O people, assuredly Allah's promise is true.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “The promise” implies the promise of the Hereafter to which allusion was made in the preceding sentence, saying: “And to Allah return all matters.”
- `So let the life of the world not delude you,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Let not deceive you”: Deceive you that the world is an end in itself: that there is no Hereafter when one will have to render an account of one’s deeds: or that even if there is the Hereafter, the one who is enjoying life here will enjoy life there, too.
- `and let not the Deluder delude you concerning Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Great deceiver”: Satan, as is evident from the next sentence. And “deceive you concerning Allah” means:

## Ayat 06

- `Surely Satan is an enemy to you.`
- `Therefore, do take him as an enemy.`
- `He calls his followers to his way so that they may be among the inmates of the Fire.`

## Ayat 07

- `A severe chastisement lies in store for those that disbelieve,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Those who disbelieve”: those who will refuse to believe in this invitation of Allah’s Book and His Messenger.
- `but there is pardon and a great reward for those that believe and work righteous deeds.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Allah will overlook their errors and will reward them for their good deeds not merely with what they will just deserve but much more richly and generously.
