**Ayat 27 - 37**

## Ayat 27

- `Do you not see that Allah sent down water from the sky with which We brought forth fruits of diverse hues?`
- `In the mountains there are white and red, of diverse hues, and pitchy black;`

## Ayat 28

- `and human beings too, and beasts, and cattle diverse are their hues.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is meant to impress that in the universe created by Allah nowhere is there homogeneity and uniformity; there is variety everywhere. From the same earth and by the same water different kinds of trees are appearing. Even the two pieces of the fruit of the same tree are not uniform in color and size and taste. In the same mountain one will see a variety of colors and a great difference in the material composition of its different parts. Even among human beings and animals one will not see two offspring of the same parents exactly alike. If a person seeks uniformity of the temperaments and dispositions and mentalities in this universe and is bewildered at the differences which have been alluded to in( verses 19-22) above, it will be his own perception and understanding to blame.
    - This same variety and difference, in fact, point to the reality that this universe has been created by a Wise Being with great wisdom; its Maker is a Unique Creator and a Matchless Fashioner, Who does not have the same model of everything before Him, but has a variety of countless and limitless designs of everything. Then if one ponders over the differences in human temperaments and minds, in particular, one will see that it is not a mere accident, but in fact the masterpiece of the wisdom of creation. If all human beings had been created with the uniform temperaments and desires and feelings and inclinations and ways of thinking, and no room had been left for any difference, it would have been absolutely useless to bring about a new creation like man in the world. When the Creator decided to bring into existence a responsible creation, a creation having power and authority, the necessary inevitable demand of the nature of the decision was that room for all sorts of differences should be provided in its nature and structure. This is the main proof of the fact that the creation of man is not the result of an accident, but the result of a wonderful and wise plan and design. And obviously, wherever there is a wise plan and design, there must necessarily be a Wise Being working behind it, for the existence of wisdom without a Wise Being would be un-imaginable.
- `From among His servants, it is only those who know that fear Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the more a person is unaware of the attributes of Allah, the more he will be fearless of Him. Contrary to this, the more a person is aware and conscious of Allah’s powers, His knowledge, His wisdom, His vengeance and His omnipotence and His other attributes, the more he will fear His disobedience. Thus, in fact, knowledge in this verse does not imply knowledge of academic subjects like philosophy and science and history and mathematics, etc. but the knowledge of divine attributes, no matter whether one is literate or illiterate.
    - The one who is fearless of God is illiterate merely as regards to this knowledge even if he has all the knowledge of the world. And the one who knows the attributes of God and fears Him in his heart, is learned even if he is illiterate.
    - In the same connection, one should also know that in this verse the ulama does not imply the scholars in the technical sense, who are termed as religious scholars because of their knowledge of the Quran and Hadith and Fiqh and philosophy. **They will prove true to this verse only when they possess fear of God in their hearts.** 
    - The same thing has been said by Abdullah bin Masud, thus: **Knowledge is not due to much narration of Hadith but due to much fear of Allah.** And also by Hassan Basri, thus: **The scholar is he who fears Allah though he has not seen Him, and turns to what is approved by Him and keeps away from what makes Him angry.**
- `Verily Allah is Most Mighty, Most Forgiving.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, He is All-Mighty, and therefore, can seize the disobedient as and when He likes: no one can escape His grasp. But He is All-Forgiving also and is, therefore, giving respite to the wrongdoers.

## Ayat 29

- `Surely those who`
- `recite the Book of Allah and`
- `establish Prayer and`
- `spend, privately and publicly, out of what We have provided them,`
- `look forward to a trade that shall suffer no loss;`

## Ayat 30

- `(a trade in which they have invested their all) so that Allah may pay them their wages in full and may add to them out of His Bounty.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This kind of conduct and practice of the believers has been likened to a trade bargain because in trade a man invests his money and labor and capabilities in the hope that he will not only get his capital back and his wages for the time and energy spent but in addition some profit as well. **Likewise, a believer also invests his wealth and his time and his labor and capabilities in carrying out Allah’s commands and in His service and worship and in the struggle to promote the cause of His religion in the hope that he will not only get his full rewards for it but Allah will bless him with much more from His bounty as well.**
    - But there is a great difference between the two kinds of bargains. In the worldly trade bargains there is the risk of loss also along with the hope of profits. Contrary to this, **in the bargain that a sincere servant makes with his God there is no risk of any loss whatever.**
- `He is Most Forgiving, Most Appreciative.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Allah’s relation with the sincere believers is not that of a miserly master who checks his servant on trivialities and brings all his services and loyalties to naught on account of a minor error. But Allah is the Most Beneficent and Generous Master. He overlooks the errors of His obedient servant and appreciates whatever service he might be able to render.

## Ayat 31

- `(O Prophet), the Book We have revealed to you is the Truth, confirming the Books that came before it.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This implies the Muslims, who have been sorted out from all mankind so that they may become heirs to the Book of Allah, and convey its message to others after the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Though this Book has been presented before all human beings, those who accepted it in the first instance, were chosen for the honor to become heirs to a great Book like the Quran and the trustees of the teaching and guidance imparted by a great Messenger like the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
- `Verily Allah is well aware of His servants and sees everything.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The object of mentioning these attributes of Allah here is to arouse the people to the aims and ideals in which their true well being lies, to the principles which alone can afford the right guidance and to the rules and regulations which are precisely in accordance with them. None can know these except Allah, because He alone is aware of the nature of His servants and its demands, and He alone watches over their well-being and affairs. The people do not know their own selves as much as their Creator knows them. Therefore, the truth is that, and can only be that, which He has taught by revelation.

## Ayat 32

- `Then We bequeathed the Book to those of Our servants that We chose.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This implies the Muslims, who have been sorted out from all mankind so that they may become heirs to the Book of Allah, and convey its message to others after the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Though this Book has been presented before all human beings, those who accepted it in the first instance, were chosen for the honor to become heirs to a great Book like the Quran and the trustees of the teaching and guidance imparted by a great Messenger like the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
- `Now,`
  - `some of them wrong themselves and`
  - `some follow the medium course; and`
  - `some, by Allah's leave, vie with each other in acts of goodness.`
- `That is the great bounty.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, All these Muslims are not alike but are divided into three classes:

## Ayat 33

- `They shall enter the everlasting Gardens,`
- `shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and with pearls, and their apparel therein shall be silk.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - One section of the commentators has held the view that this sentence is related with the two sentences immediately preceding it. That is, the ones who excel in good deeds are the best of the people and they alone will enter the Gardens. As for the first two groups, nothing has been stated about them so that they became worried concerning their fate and try to improve their lot. This view has been presented by Allama Zamakhshari forcefully and supported by Imam Razi.
  - But the majority of the commentators opine that it is related with the whole preceding discourse, which means that all the three classes of the ummah shall eventually enter Paradise, whether without accountability, or after the accountability, whether remaining secure from every punishment, or after receiving some punishment. This commentary is supported by the Quranic context, for a little below about those who are contrasted with the heirs of the Book, it has been said: **“And for those who have disbelieved, there is the fire of Hell.”**
  - This shows that there is Paradise for all those who have believed in the Book, and Hell for all those who have refused to believe in it. The same has been supported by the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him), which Imam Ahmad, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim, Tabarani, Baihaqi and some other traditionalists have related on the authority of Abu ad- Darda. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:

## Ayat 34

- `They will say:`
  - `“All praise be to Allah Who has taken away all sorrow from us.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - “Sorrow”: Sorrow of every kind: sorrows and griefs and worries of the world and of the Hereafter with regard to the final end. It means: Now we have nothing to worry about: now there can be no question of any sorrow and trouble afflicting us here.
  - `Surely our Lord is Most Forgiving, Most Appreciative;`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is He has forgiven us our errors, has appreciated whatever little provision of deeds we had brought and blessed us with His Paradise as a reward.

## Ayat 35

- `(the Lord) Who, out of His Bounty, has made us dwell in an abode`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the world was a stage in our journey of life, which we have crossed, and the plain of Resurrection also is a stage of the same journey, which we have also crossed. Now we have reached a place which is our eternal abode: we have not to go elsewhere from here.
- `wherein no toil, nor fatigue affects us.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In other words, all our toils and afflictions have come to an end. Now we do not have to perform any work here in carrying out which we might have to experience any rigor or hardship and after carrying out which we might be fatigued.

## Ayat 36

- `As for those who disbelieved, the Fire of Hell awaits them.`
- `There they shall not be finished off and die; nor will the torment (of Hell) be lightened for them.`
- `Thus do We requite every thankless being.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Who disbelieved”: Who have refused to believe in the Book which Allah has sent down on Muhammad (peace be upon him).

## Ayat 37

- `They will cry out in Hell and say:`
  - `“Our Lord, let us out so that we may act righteously, different from what we did before.”`
- `(They will be told):`
  - `“Did we not grant you an age long enough for anyone to take heed if he had wanted to take heed?`
  - `Besides, there came a warner to you.`
  - `So have a taste of the torment now.`
  - `None may come to the help of the wrong-doers.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This implies every such age of life in which a person may be able to distinguish between good and evil, truth and falsehood, if he likes to, and turn to right guidance instead of deviation, if he wishes. If a person has died before attaining such an age, he will not be called to any account according to this verse. However, the one who has attained this age will certainly be held answerable for his actions. Then, as long as he lives after attaining this age and gets more and more opportunities for choosing and adopting the right path, his responsibility also will increase accordingly; so much so that the one who does not adopt right guidance even in old age will have no chance left for making any excuse. This same thing has been reported by Abu Hurairah and Sahl bin Saad as-Saidi in a Hadith, saying: **The one who lives a short life has an excuse to offer, but there is no room for making an excuse for him who lives for 60 years or more.”** (Bukhari Ahmad, Nasai, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim).
