**Ayat 08 - 14**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - (Verses 3-7) were addressed to the common people. In this paragraph mention has been made of the standard bearers of error and deviation, who were exerting their utmost to frustrate and defeat the mission of the Prophet (peace be upon him).

## Ayat 08

- `(How awful is the straying of the person) for whom his evil deed has been embellished so that it looks fair to him?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, one kind of perverted person is he who commits evil but knows and understands that he is committing evil. Such a person can be reformed by counsel and advice, and sometimes his own conscience also pricks and brings him to the right path, for his habits only are perverted, not his mind. But there is another kind of a person whose mentality has been perverted, who has lost the discrimination between good and evil, for whom the life of sin has become alluring and lustrous, who abhors good and takes evil for civilization and culture, who regards goodness and piety as things of the past, and sinfulness and wickedness as progressiveness, and for whom guidance becomes error and error becomes guidance. Such a person is not amenable to any advice and any admonition. He neither takes warning from his own follies nor listens to a well wisher. It is useless to waste ones time and energy for the reformation of such a person. 
    - Instead, the inviter to the truth should turn his attention towards those whose consciences may still be alive and who may still be inclined to listen to the truth.
- `The fact is that Allah causes whomsoever He will to fall into error and shows the Right Way to whomsoever He will.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The insertion of the words “Then indeed, Allah sends astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills” between the preceding and this sentence, clearly gives the meaning that Allah deprives, of the grace of guidance, those who become so perverted mentally, and leaves them to wander aimlessly in the ways in which they themselves wish to remain lost. After making the Prophet (peace be upon him) realize this fact Allah exhorts him to the effect: It is not within your power to bring such people to the right path; therefore, have patience in their regard. Just as Allah is indifferent about them, so should you also avoid being unduly anxious about their reformation.
- `So, (O Prophet), let not your life go to waste sorrowing over them.`
- `Allah is well aware of all that they do.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here, one should bear in mind two things very clearly.
    - First, the people being mentioned here were not the common people, but the chiefs of Makkah, who were employing every falsehood, every fraud and every trick to defeat the mission of the Prophet (peace be upon him). These people were, in fact, not involved in any misunderstanding about the Prophet (peace be upon him). They knew well what he was calling them to and what were the evils and moral weaknesses which they themselves were striving to maintain. After knowing and understanding all this, they had firmly resolved not to let him succeed in his object. And for this purpose they did not feel any hesitation in using any mean or petty device. Now, evidently the people who deliberately and after annual consultation invent a new falsehood every next day and spread it against a person, can deceive the whole world but as for themselves they know that they are the liars and that the person whom they have accused is free of every blame. Then, if the person against whom the false propaganda is being made also does not react and respond in a way opposed to truth and righteousness, the unjust people also cannot help realizing that their opponent is a truthful and honest man. If in spite of this the people do not feel ashamed of their misconduct and continue to oppose and resist the truth with falsehood, their conduct itself testifies that they are under Allah’s curse and they can no longer discriminate between good and evil.

## Ayat 09

- `It is Allah Who sends forth winds which then set the clouds in motion, which We drive to some dead land giving a fresh life to earth after it had become dead.`
- `Such will be the resurrection of the dead.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, these ignorant people think that the Hereafter is impossible. That is why they are living under the delusion that they may do whatever they like in the world, the time will never come when they will have to appear before their God and render an account of their deeds. But this is no more than a delusion. On the Day of Resurrection, the dead men of all ages will suddenly rise back to life at one call of Allah just as the dead earth comes back to life at one shower of the rain and the roots, lying dead for ages, become green and start sprouting up from the layers of the earth.

## Ayat 10

- `He who seeks glory, let him know that all glory belongs to Allah alone.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It should be noted that whatever the chiefs of the Quraish were doing against the Prophet (peace be upon him), they were doing it for the sake of their honor and dignity. They thought that if the Prophet (peace be upon him) succeeded in his mission, their greatness and glory would fade away, their influence would die out and their honor among the Arabs would be ruined. At this it is being said: The honor that you have attained for yourselves by your disbelief and rebellion against Allah is a false honor, which is destined to be ruined. The real and enduring honor, which can never suffer debasement, can be attained only through service of Allah. If you turn sincerely and faithfully to Him, you will attain it. And if you turn away from Him, you are bound to live an abject and wretched life.
- `To Him do good words go up, and righteous action uplifts them.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the real means of attaining the honor. In the sight of Allah, the false, vicious and mischievous can never rise and flourish.
    - **In His sight only such a word can rise and flourish which is honest and pure and is based on the truth, and in which a righteous creed and a correct point of view may have been expressed and presented.** Then the thing which makes the pure word to rise and prosper is **the action which conforms to it.**
    - Wherever the word is pure but the action is opposed to it, the purity of the word suffers a blemish. The mere extravagant rise of the tongue does not exalt a word: the power of the righteous action is needed to exalt and raise it high. Here, one should also note that the Quran presents the righteous word and the righteous action as interdependent. No action can be righteous merely on the basis of its external and apparent form unless it has a righteous creed behind it. And no righteous creed can be reliable unless it is supported and confirmed by a person’s action.
    - For instance, if a person says that he regards Allah, the One, alone as his Deity, but worships others than Allah in practical life, his action belies his word. If a person says that he regards the wine as unlawful but drinks it, his mere word can neither be acceptable to the people nor deserve approval in the sight of Allah.
- `But those who contrive evil deeds, a severe punishment lies in store for them, and their contriving will come to naught.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Those who plot evil”: Those who propagate false and evil words by means of cunning tricks, deceit and deceptive reasoning, and do not feel any hesitation in employing any device, however mean and depraved, to frustrate and defeat the word of the truth.

## Ayat 11

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - From here again the discourse is directed to the common people.


- `Allah created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, man in the first instance was created from the dust directly. Then his race was perpetuated through the sperm-drop.
- `then He made you into pairs.`
- `No female conceives, nor delivers (a child) except with His knowledge.`
- `None is given a long life nor is any diminished in his life but it is written in a Book.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it is pre-ordained for everyone who is born in this world how long he will live. If a person lives a long life, he does so by Allah’s decree, and if another one lives a short life, he too lives so by Allah’s decree.
    - Some ignorant people give the argument that in the past the death rate of the newly born children used to be high, and now it has been checked by the advancement of the medical science. And the people used to live short lives in the past, now due to better medical facilities the life span has increased. But this argument could be presented in refutation of the Quranic argument only when it could be ascertained that Allah, for instance, had preordained a two year life for a certain person, and the modern medical facilities have enhanced it by a day. If a person has no such knowledge, he cannot refute this Quranic statement on any rational grounds. Only on the basis of the statistics that the death rate among children has fallen, or that the people now are living longer lives, it cannot be argued that man has now become able to change the decrees of Allah. Rationally it is not impossible that Allah might have fixed different life spans for the people born in different periods, and this might also be Allah Almighty’s decree that man in such and such an age would be granted curative power to treat such and such diseases, and in such and such a period man would be given greater means for longevity.
- `Surely that is quite easy for Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it is not at all difficult for Allah to give commands and pass judgments about each individual of His countless creations when He possesses detailed and perfect knowledge about them.

## Ayat 12

- `The two masses of water are not alike.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the body of water in the oceans, and the body of water in the rivers and springs and lakes.
- `The one is sweet, sates thirst, and is pleasant to drink from, while the other is salt, bitter on the tongue.`
- `Yet from both you eat fresh meat,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Fresh meat”: Meat of water animals.
- `and extract from it ornaments that you wear;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is pearls and corals and, in some rivers, diamonds and gold.
- `and you see ships cruising through it that you may seek of His Bounty and be thankful to Him.`

## Ayat 13

- `He causes the night to phase into the day and the day into the night,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the light of the day starts diminishing and the darkness of the night increasing gradually so as to cover up everything completely. Likewise, towards the end of the night, in the beginning, a streak of the light appears on the horizon, and then the bright day dawns.
- `and He has subjected the sun and the moon, each running its course to an appointed term.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Subjected ”: means subjected to a law.
- `That is Allah, your Lord;`
- `to Him belongs the Kingdom;`
- `but those whom you call upon, apart from Allah, possess not so much as the skin of a date-stone.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word qitmir in the original means the thin skin that covers the stone of the date fruit; but what is meant to be said is that the gods of the mushriks do not own anything whatever. That is why we have translated it “a blade of grass”, which is an insignificant thing.

## Ayat 14

- `If you call upon them, they cannot hear your prayer.`
- `And if they hear it, they cannot answer it.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This does not mean that they cannot tell aloud, in answer to your prayer whether your prayer has been accepted or not, but it means that they cannot take any action on your supplications. If a person sends his application to someone who is not a ruler, his application miscarries. For, the person to whom it has been sent, who has no authority whatever: he can neither reject it nor accept it. However, if the same application is sent to the one who is really a ruler, one or the other action will certainly be taken on it.
- `On the Day of Resurrection they will disown you for associating others with Allah in His Divinity.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they will plainly say: We had never told them that we are Allah’s associates and that they should worship us. On the contrary, we were not at all aware that they regarded us as Allah’s associates and were invoking us for help. None of their prayers has reached us, nor has any of their gifts and offerings.
- `No one can inform you of the truth save the All-Aware.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “All-Knower”: Allah Almighty Himself. It means this: The other person can at the most refine shirk and prove the powerlessness of the gods of the polytheists by rational arguments only, but We are directly aware of the absolute truth. We are telling you, on the basis of knowledge, that all those whom the people believe to be possessing some powers in Our Godhead are absolutely powerless. 
    - They have no authority whatsoever by which they might do somebody good or harm. And We know this directly that on the Day of Resurrection, these gods of the mushriks will themselves refute their shirk.
