**Ayat 38 - 45**

## Ayat 38

- `Surely Allah knows the Unseen in the heavens and the earth.`
- `He even knows the secrets hidden in people's breasts.`

## Ayat 39

- `It is He Who made you vicegerents in the earth.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This can have two meanings:
      - (1) Now He has settled you on His earth after the passing away of the previous generations and nations.
- `So whoever disbelieves will bear the burden of his unbelief.`
- `The unbelievers' unbelief adds nothing but Allah's wrath against them.`
- `The unbelievers' unbelief adds nothing but their own loss.`

## Ayat 40

- `Say to them (O Prophet):`
  - `“Have you ever seen those of your associates upon whom you call apart from Allah?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - “Associates of yours”, because they are not in fact the associates of Allah, but the ones whom the polytheists themselves have made associates of Allah.
  - `Show me what have they created in the earth?`
  - `Or do they have any partnership (with Allah) in the heavens?`
  - `Or have We given them a Book so that they have a clear proof (for associating others with Allah in His Divinity)?”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, do they possess a written sanction from Us in which We might have indicated that We have given such and such persons the powers to heal the sick, or to get jobs for the jobless, or to fulfill needs of the needy, or that We have made such and such beings Our representatives in such and such parts of the earth and now it is in their hands to make or mar the destinies of the people of those parts; therefore, Our servants now should pray to them and present gifts and offerings before them, and for whatever blessings they receive they should thank those demigods only?
      - If you possess any such sanction, produce it. And if you have no such sanction, you should consider on what grounds you have invented these polytheistic creeds and practices.
      - When you are asked as to what sign is there in the heavens and the earth that may point to your self invented gods as being God’s associates, you cannot point out any. When you are asked to produce any divine sanction from any Book of Allah, or from your own possession, or from the possession of your self-invented gods, which may testify to God s having Himself delegated to them those powers which you assign to them, you do not produce any. What then is the basis of your these creeds and concepts? Are you the owners of the divine rights and powers that you may assign and distribute them to whomsoever you please?
- `Nay, what these wrong-doers promise each other is nothing but delusion.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, these religious guides, saints, priests, sorcerers, preachers and attendants of shrines and their agents are fooling the people for selfish motives, and are concocting stories to give them false hopes that if they became the followers of such and such personalities, apart from God, they would have all their wishes and needs fulfilled in the world, and all their sins, no matter-how grave and numerous, forgiven by Allah in the Hereafter.


## Ayat 41

- `Surely Allah holds the heavens and the earth, lest they should be displaced there, for if they were displaced none would be able to hold them after Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, this limitless universe is being sustained by Allah alone. No angel, or jinn, or prophet, or saint can sustain it.
    - Not to speak of sustaining the universe these helpless creatures do not even have the power to sustain their own selves. Each one of them is entirely dependent on Allah Almighty for his birth and survival every moment. To think that any one of them has any share in the attributes and powers of divinity is sheer folly and deception.
- `Surely He is Most Forbearing, Most Forgiving.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it is Allah’s Clemency and Forbearance that He is not seizing the culprits immediately in punishment in spite of All kinds of disobedience which are being shown towards Him.


## Ayat 42

- `Swearing by Allah their strongest oaths they claimed that if a warner came to them they would be better-guided than any other people.`
- `But when a warner did come to them, his coming only increased their aversion (to the Truth).`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Before the advent of the Prophet (peace be upon him), the same thing used to be said by the Arabs, in general, and by the Quraish, in particular, when they witnessed the moral degeneration of the Jews and the Christians. Mention of this saying of theirs has also been made in( Surah Al-Anaam, Ayats 156-157) and in (Surah As-Saffat, Ayats 167-169).

## Ayat 43

- `They began to wax even more proud on earth and contrived evil designs although the contriving of evil designs only overtakes their authors.`
- `Are they waiting, then, for anything except what happened to the nations before them?`
- `You shall not find any change in the Way of Allah;`
- `and you shall not find anything that can ever alter the Way of Allah.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, this Law of Allah that the nation which repudiates its Prophet, is destroyed should be applied in their case as well.

## Ayat 44

- `Have they not journeyed in the earth to behold the end of those who went before them though they were stronger than them in might?`
- **`Nothing in the heavens nor on earth can frustrate Him in the least.`**
- **`He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.`**

## Ayat 45

- `If Allah were to take people to task for their deeds, He would not leave any living creature on earth, but He grants them respite to an appointed time.`
- `When their appointed time comes to an end, surely Allah fully observes His servants.`
