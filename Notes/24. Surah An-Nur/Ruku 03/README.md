**Ayat  21 - 26**

## Ayat 21

- `Believers!`
- `Do not follow in Satan's footsteps.`
- `Let him who follows in Satan's footsteps (remember that) Satan bids people to indecency and evil.`
- `Were it not for Allah's Bounty and His Mercy unto you, not one of you would have ever attained purity.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Satan is bent upon involving you in all kinds of pollutions and indecencies. Had it not been for the mercy and kindness of Allah Who enables you to differentiate between good and evil and helps you to educate and reform yourselves, you would not have been able to lead a pure and virtuous life on the strength of your own faculties and initiative alone.
- `But Allah enables whomsoever He wills to attain purity.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It is Allah’s will alone which decides whom to make pious and virtuous.
    - His decisions are not arbitrary but based on knowledge.
    - He alone knows who is anxious to live a life of virtue and who is attracted towards a life of sin.
    - Allah hears a person’s most secret talk, and is aware of everything that passes in his mind.
    - It is on the basis of this direct knowledge that Allah decides whom to bless with piety and virtue and whom to ignore.
- **`Allah is All- Hearing, All-Knowing.`**


## Ayat 22

- `Let those among you who are bounteous and resourceful not swear to withhold giving to the kindred, to the needy, and to those who have forsaken their homes in the cause of Allah; rather, let them forgive and forbear.`
- `Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you?`
- **`Allah is Ever Forgiving, Most Merciful.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Aishah has stated that after the revelation of (verses 11 - 21)absolving her from the accusation, Abu Bakr swore that he would no longer support Mistah bin Uthatha. This was because the man had shown absolutely no regard for the relationship, nor for the favors that Abu Bakr had all along been showing him and his family.
  - At this (verse 22) was revealed and Abu Bakr, on hearing it, immediately said:
    - **By God, we do want that Allah should forgive us.** 
  - Consequently he again started to help Mistah and in a more liberal manner than before. According to Abdullah bin Abbas, some other companions, besides Abu Bakr, also had sworn that they would discontinue helping those who had taken an active part in the slander. After the revelation of this verse, all of them revoked their oaths and the ill-will that had been created by the mischief was gone.

## Ayat 23

- `Those that accuse chaste, unwary, believing women,`
- `have been cursed in the world and the Hereafter,`
- `and a mighty chastisement awaits them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The word ghafilat as used in the text means the women who are simple, unpretentious souls, who do not know any artifice, who have pious hearts and have no idea of immorality.
  - They cannot even imagine that their names could ever be associated with any slander.
  - The Prophet (peace be upon him) has said: **To slander chaste women is one of the seven deadly sins.**
  - According to another tradition cited by Tabarani from Huzaifah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: **To slander a pious woman suffices to ruin the good deeds of a hundred years.**

## Ayat 24

- `(Let them not be heedless of) the Day when their own tongues, their hands, and their feet shall all bear witness against them as to what they have been doing.`

## Ayat 25

- `On that Day Allah will justly requite them,`
- `and they will come to know that Allah - and He alone - is the Truth, the One Who makes the Truth manifest.`

## Ayat 26

- `Corrupt women are for corrupt men, and corrupt men for corrupt women.`
- `Good women are for good men, and good men for good women.`
- `They are innocent of the calumnies people utter.1`
- `There shall be forgiveness for them and a generous provision.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse enunciates a fundamental principle.
  - Impure men are a fit match for impure women and pious men are a fit match for pious women.
  - It never happens that a man is good in all other aspects but is addicted to a solitary vice. As a matter of fact, his very habits, manners and demeanor, all contain a number of evil traits, which sustain and nourish that single vice. It is impossible that a man develops a vice all of a sudden without having any trace of its existence in his demeanor and way of life. This is a psychological truth which everybody experiences in the daily lives of the people. 
  - How is it then possible that a man who has all along lived a pure and morally clean life, will put up and continue to live for years in love with a wife who is adulterous?
  - Can a woman be imagined who is an adulteress, but she does not manifest her evil character through her talk, gait, manners and deportment?
  - Is it possible for a virtuous man of high character to live happily with a woman of this type?
  - What is being suggested here is that people in future should not credulously put their belief in any rumor that reaches them. They should carefully see as to who is being accused and on what account and whether the accusation fairly sticks on the person or not.
  - And when there exists no trace of evidence to support the accusation, people cannot believe it just because a foolish or wicked person has uttered it.
