**Ayat  62 - 64**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - These are the final instructions being given to tighten the discipline of the Muslim community and make it more organized than before.

## Ayat 62

- `The true believers are only those who sincerely believe in Allah and in His Messenger and who, whenever they are with him on some common errand, they do not go away until they have asked leave of him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This commandment is also applicable in respect of the successors of the Prophet (peace be upon him) after him and other leaders of the Muslims.
    - When the Muslims are called upon to get together for a common cause, whether relating to war or peace, it is not permissible for them to retreat or disperse without due permission of the leader.
- `Verily those who ask leave of you, it is they who truly believe in Allah and His Messenger.`
- `So if they ask your leave in connection with some of their affairs,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This contains a warning that it is absolutely unlawful to ask permission without any genuine need.
- `give leave to those whom you will,`
- `and ask Allah for forgiveness on their behalf.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This again contains a warning: If in asking permission there is even a tinge of excuse making, or of placing individual interests above collective interests, it would be a sin.
    - Therefore the Prophet or his successor should also pray for the forgiveness of the one whom he gives permission.
- **`Surely Allah is Much Forgiving, Ever Merciful.`**

## Ayat 63

- `(Muslims!)`
- `Do not make the calling of the Messenger among you as your calling one another.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Dua means to summon, to pray and to call.
    - Dua-ar- Rasul, therefore, may mean summoning or praying by the Messenger or calling the Messenger.
    - The verse can thus have three meanings which would all be equally correct;
      1. The Prophet’s summons should not be treated as a common man’s summons, for the Prophet’s summon is of extraordinary importance, which you cannot ignore, because if you fail to respond to it, or feel hesitant about it, you will be doing so at the very risk of your faith.
      2. Do not consider the Prophet’s prayer as a common man’s prayer. If he is pleased with you and prays for you, there can be no greater good fortune for you. But if he is displeased with you and curses you, there can be no greater misfortune for you.
      3. Calling the Prophet should not be like calling among yourselves of each other. That is, you should not call or address the Prophet just as you call and address other people aloud by their names. You should have full respect for him, because the slightest disrespect in this regard will call for Allah’s reckoning in the Hereafter.
    - Though all the three meanings quite fit in with the context, the first meaning is more in keeping with the theme which follows.
- `Allah knows well those of you who surreptitiously steal away, taking shelter behind one another.`
- `Let those who go against the order (of the Messenger) beware lest a trial or severe punishment afflict them.`


## Ayat 64

- `Lo!`
- `Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah.`
- `He is well aware of your ways.`
- `And the Day when they will be returned to Him,`
- `He will tell them all what they did.`
- `Allah knows everything.`
