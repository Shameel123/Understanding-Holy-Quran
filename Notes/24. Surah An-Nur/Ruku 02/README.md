**Ayat  11 - 20**
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is an allusion to the slander against Aishah.
    - Allah has Himself described it as ifk (false accusation, calumny) which implies its total refutation.
    - From here begins the mention of the incident which provided the occasion of this Surah’s revelation.
    - We have reproduced the initial part of it in the introduction as related by Aishah herself; the rest of it is reproduced below. She says:
      - Rumours about this slander went on spreading in the city for about a month, which caused great distress and anguish to the Prophet (peace be upon him).
      - I cried due to helplessness and my parents were sick with mental agony.
      - At last one day the Prophet (peace be upon him) visited us and he sat near me, which he had not done since the slander had started. Feeling that something decisive was going to happen that day, Abu Bakr and Umm Ruman (Aishah’s mother) also sat near us.
      - The Prophet (peace be upon him) started the conversation, saying: **Aishah, I have heard this and this about you: if you are innocent, I expect that Allah will declare your innocence. But it you you have committed a sin, you should offer repentance and ask for Allah’s forgiveness; when a servant (of Allah) confesses his guilt and repents, Allah forgives him.**
      - Hearing these words, tears dried in my eyes. I looked up to my father expecting that he would reply to the Prophet (peace be upon him), but he said: Daughter, I do not know what I should say. Then I turned to my mother, but she also did not know what to say. At last I said: **You have all heard something about me and believed it. Now if I say that I am innocent and Allah is my witness that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something which I never did and Allah knows that I never did it, you will believe me.**
      - At that time I tried to call to memory the name of Prophet Jacob but could not recall it. Therefore in view of the predicament that I was placed in, I said: **I cannot but repeat the words which the father of Prophet Joseph had spoken: fasabrun jamil: I will bear this patiently with good grace. (Surah Yousuf, Ayat 83)**.
      - Saying this I lay down and turned to the other side. I was thinking that Allah was aware of my innocence, and He would certainly reveal the truth, but I could never imagine that divine revelation would come down in my defense, which the people will read and recite till the Last Day.
      - What I thought probable was that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would see a dream in which Allah would indicate my innocence. But in the meantime suddenly, the state of receiving revelation appeared on the Prophet (peace be upon him), when pearl-like drops of perspiration used to gather on his face even in severe winter. We all held our breath and sat silent. As for me I was fearless, but my parents seemed to be struck with fear; they did not know what the divine revelation would be. When the revelation was over, the Prophet (peace be upon him) seemed to be very pleased. Over-joyed with happiness the first words he spoke were: **Congratulations, Aishah, Allah has sent down proof of your innocence and then he recited these ten(verses 11-21)**.
      - At this my mother said to me: Get up and thank the Prophet (peace be upon him). I said: **I shall neither thank him nor you two, but thank Allah Who has sent down my absolution. You did not even so much as contradict the charge against me.**
      - *(This is not the translation of any one tradition, but the substance of many traditions which are found in the books of Hadith in connection with the incident of the slander against Hadrat Aishah)*.
      - One subtle point to be understood here is that before mentioning the absolution of Aishah, a full section of verses has been devoted to the commandments pertaining to zina, qazf and lian by which Allah means to admonish that zina is not a slight matter which may be used as a means of entertaining the people in a gathering. It is very serious. If the accuser is right in his accusation he should produce witnesses, and get a most horrible punishment inflicted upon the adulterer and the adulteress. If the accuser is false, he deserves to be given 80 stripes, so that nobody may dare to bring a false charge against the other person. And if the accuser is a husband, he will have to exercise lian in a court of law to settle the matter. So, none who utters such an accusation will have peace. The Islamic society which has been brought about for the purpose of establishing goodness and piety in the world can neither tolerate zina as a means of entertainment nor endure loose talk about it as a diversion and amusement.
      - Only a few persons have been mentioned in traditions, who were spreading the rumours. They were: Abdullah bin Ubayy, Zaid bin Rifaah (who was probably the son of Rifaah bin Zaid, the Jewish hypocrite), Mistah bin Uthathah, Hassan bin Thabit, and Hamnah bint Jahsh. The first two of these were hypocrites, and the other three Muslims, who had been involved in the mischief due to misunderstanding and weakness. Names of the other people who were more or less involved in the mischief have not been mentioned in the books of Hadith and life of the Prophet (peace be upon him).

## Ayat 11

- `Surely those who invented this calumny`
- `are a band from among you.`
- `Do not deem this incident an evil for you;`
- `nay, it is good for you.`
- `Every one of them has accumulated sin in proportion to his share in this guilt;`
- `and he who has the greater part of it shall suffer a mighty chastisement.`

## Ayat 12

- `When you heard of it,`
- `why did the believing men and women not think well of their own folk`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This may also be translated as: Why did they not have a good opinion of the people of their own community and society?
    - The words in the text are comprehensive and contain a subtle meaning which should be understood well. What happened concerning Aishah and Safwan bin Muattal was only this: A woman belonging to the caravan (apart from the fact that she was the Prophet’s wife) was left behind, and a man belonging to the same caravan, who was also left behind, happened to see her and brought her on his camel to the camp. Now if a person alleges that when the two found themselves alone, they became involved in sin, the accusation would imply two other hypotheses:
      1. First, if the accuser himself (whether man or woman) had been there, he would certainly have availed of the rare opportunity and committed the sinful act, for he had never before chanced upon a person of the opposite sex in a situation like this. 
      2. Second, the accuser’s assessment of the moral condition of the society he belongs to is that in that society there is no man or woman who could possibly have abstained from sin in similar circumstances. This will be the case when it involves any one man and any one woman. But supposing if the man and the woman happened to belong to the same place, and the woman who was left behind by chance was the wife, or sister, or daughter of a friend, or a relative, or a neighbor, or an acquaintance of the man, the matter would become much more serious and grave. Then it would mean that the one who utters such an accusation has a very poor and degraded opinion of himself as well as of his society, which has nothing to do with morality and good sense. No gentleman can imagine that if he finds a woman belonging to the family of a friend, or a neighbor or an acquaintance, stranded on the way, the first thing he would do would be to molest and dishonor her, and then would think of escorting her home. But here the matter was a thousand times more serious. The lady was no other than the wife of the Prophet (peace be upon him) of Allah, whom every Muslim esteemed higher than his own mother, and whom Allah Himself had forbidden for every Muslim just like his own mother. The man was not only a follower of the same caravan and a soldier of the same army, and an inhabitant of the same city, but also a Muslim, who believed in the lady’s husband to be the Messenger of Allah and his religious leader and guide, and had even followed him and fought in the most dangerous battle at Badr. Viewed against this background, it would seem that the person who uttered such an accusation and those who considered the accusation as probable, formed a very poor opinion not only of their moral selves but also of the whole society.
- `and say:`
  - `"This is a manifest calumny?"`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the accusation was not worth any consideration; the Muslims should have rejected it there and then as a lie and a falsehood.
    - A question might be asked: **Why did not the Prophet (peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr Siddiq reject it on the very first day, and why did they give it all that importance?**
    - The answer is that **the position of the husband and the father is different from that of the common people.**
    - Though none else can know a woman better than her husband and a righteous husband cannot doubt the character of a virtuous and pious wife only on account of the people’s accusations, but when the wife is accused, the husband is placed in a difficult situation. Even if he rejects it outright as a calumny, the accusers will not listen. They will rather say that the woman is clever and has beguiled the husband into believing that she is virtuous and pious whereas she is not.
    - A similar situation is faced by the parents. They also cannot remove the accusers’ slander regarding their daughter’s chastity even if they know that the accusation is manifestly false.
    - The same thing had afflicted the Prophet (peace be upon him), Abu Bakr and Umm Ruman, otherwise they did not entertain any doubt about Aishah's character. That is why the Prophet (peace be upon him) had declared in his sermon that he had neither seen any evil in his wife nor in the man who was being mentioned in the slander.

## Ayat 13

- `Why did they not bring four witnesses in support of their accusation?`
- `Now that they have brought no witnesses, it is indeed they who are liars in the sight of Allah.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “With Allah”: In the sight of Allah or in the law of Allah, or according to the law of Allah.
  - Obviously, in Allah’s knowledge, the accusation was by itself false and its falsehood was in no way dependent on the production of witnesses by the accusers.


## Ayat 14

- `Were it not for Allah's Bounty and His Mercy unto you in the world and in the Hereafter`
- `a grievous chastisement would have seized you on account of what you indulged in.`

## Ayat 15

- `(Just think, how wrong you were) when one tongue received it from another and you uttered with your mouths something you knew nothing about. You deemed it to be a trifle while in the sight of Allah it was a serious matter.`

## Ayat 16

- `(Just think, how wrong you were) when one tongue received it from another and you uttered with your mouths something you knew nothing about.`
- `You deemed it to be a trifle while in the sight of Allah it was a serious matter.`

## Ayat 17

- `And why, no sooner than you had heard it, did you not say:`
  - `"It becomes us not even to utter such a thing?`
  - `Holy are You (O Allah)!`
  - `This is a mighty calumny."`

## Ayat 18

- `Allah admonishes you:`
- `If you are true believers, never repeat the like of what you did.`

## Ayat 19

- `Allah clearly expounds to you His instructions.`
- `Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - These verses, especially (verse 12), wherein Allah says: “Why did not the believing men and the believing women have a good opinion of themselves” provide the general principle that all dealings in the Islamic society must be based on good faith.
  - The question of a bad opinion should arise only when there is a definite and concrete basis for it. Every person should, as a matter of principle, be considered as innocent unless there are sound reasons to hold him guilty or suspect.
  - Every person should be considered as truthful unless there are strong grounds for holding him as unreliable.

## Ayat 20

- `Verily those who love that indecency should spread among the believers deserve a painful chastisement in the world and the Hereafter.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The direct interpretation of the verse, in the context in which it occurs, is this: Those who cast aspersions, propagate evil, publicize it and bring Islamic morality into disrepute deserve punishment.
    - The words in the text, however, comprehend all the various forms that can be employed for the propagation of evil.
    - These include
      - actual setting up of brothels,
      - production of
        - erotic stories,
        - songs,
        - paintings,
        - plays and
        - dramas as well as 
        - all kinds of mixed gatherings at clubs and hotels, which induce the people to immoralities.
    - **The Quran holds all those who resort to such things as criminals, who deserve punishment not only in the Hereafter but in this world as well.**
    - Accordingly, it is the duty of an Islamic government to put an end to all such means of propagating immorality.
    - Its penal law must hold all those acts as cognizable offenses which the Quran mentions as crimes against public morality and declares the offenders punishable.
- **`Allah knows, but you do not know.`**


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “You do not know”: You do not visualize the full impact of individual acts on society as a whole:
  - Allah knows best the number of people who are affected by these acts and their cumulative effect on the collective life of the community.
  - You should accordingly trust in Him and do all you can to eradicate and suppress the evils pointed out by Him.
  - These are not trivial matters to be treated lightly; these have very serious repercussions and the offenders must be dealt with severely.
