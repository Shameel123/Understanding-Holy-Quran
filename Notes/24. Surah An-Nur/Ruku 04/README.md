**Ayat  27 - 34**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The commandments given in the beginning of the Surah were meant to help eradicate evil when it had actually appeared in society. 
    - The commandments being given now are meant to prevent the very birth of evil, to reform society and root out the causes responsible for the creation and spread of evil. Before we study these commandments, it will be useful to understand two things clearly:
      1. First, the revelation of these commandments immediately after the divine appraisal of the incident of the slander clearly indicates that permeation of a calumny against the noble person of a wife of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the society, was the direct result of the existence of a sexually charged atmosphere, and in the sight of Allah there was no other way of cleansing society of the evil than of prohibiting free entry into other people’s houses, discouraging free mixing of the sexes together, forbidding women to appear in their make up before the other men, excepting a small circle of close relatives, banning prostitution, exhorting men and women not to remain unmarried for long, and arranging marriages even of the slaves and slave-girls. In other words, the movement of the women without hijab and the presence of a large number of unmarried persons in society were, in the knowledge of Allah, the real causes that imperceptibly give rise to sensuality in society. It was this sexually charged atmosphere which kept the ears, eyes, tongues and hearts of the people ever ready to get involved in any real or fictitious scandal. Allah in His wisdom did not regard any other measure more suitable and effective than these commandments to eradicate this evil; otherwise He would have enjoined some other commandments.
      2. The second important thing to remember is that divine law does not merely forbid an evil or only prescribe a punishment for the offender, but it also puts an end to all those factors which provide occasions for the evil, or incite or force a person to commit it. It also imposes curbs on the causes, incentives and means leading to the evil so as to check the wrongdoer much before he actually commits the crime. It does not like that people should freely approach and loiter about near the border lines of sin and get caught and punished all the time. It does not merely act as a prosecutor but as a guide, reformer and helper, too. So it uses all kinds of moral, social and educational devices to help the people to safeguard themselves against evil and vice.



## Ayat 27

- `Believers!`
- `Enter not houses other than your own houses until you have obtained the permission of the inmates of those houses and have greeted them with peace.`
- `This is better for you. It is expected that you will observe this.`

## Ayat 28

- `Then if you find no one in them, do not enter until you have been given permission (to enter).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Entry into an empty house is not allowed unless permitted as such by the master of the house. One may, for instance, have told a visitor or sent him a message to wait in his room till his arrival. The mere fact that there is nobody in the house, or the call is not answered does not entitle anybody to enter without permission.
- `And if you are told to go back, then do go back.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is nobody should mind if entry is refused, for everybody has a right to refuse to meet another person, or offer a plea if otherwise busy.
    - The command “Go back”, according to the jurists, means going back in the literal sense and moving away from the door. Nobody has any right to compel the other person for a meeting or to embarrass him by standing obstinately at his door.
- `This is a purer way for you.`
- **`Allah knows all what you do.`**

## Ayat 29

- `However, it is not blameworthy for you if you enter houses that are uninhabited but wherein there is something of use to you.1`
- **`Allah is well aware of what you disclose and what you conceal.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Houses which are not dwelling place are the hotels, inns, guest houses, shops, staging bungalows, etc. which are generally open to all people.

## Ayat 30

- `(O Prophet),`
- `enjoin believing men to cast down their looks1 and`
- `guard their private parts.`
- `That is purer for them.`
- **`Surely Allah is well aware of all what they do.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The word ghadd means to reduce, shorten or lower down something. 
  - Accordingly, ghadd basar is generally translated as lowering the gaze or keeping it lowered. But the command of ghadd basar does not imply that the gaze should always be kept lowered. It only means to imply that one should restrain his gaze and avoid casting of looks freely. That is, if it is not desirable to see a thing, one should turn the eyes away and avoid having a look at it. The restriction of a restrained gaze is applicable only in a limited sphere. The context in which the words occur shows that this restriction applies to the men’s gazing at women, or casting looks at the satar of the other persons, or fixing the eyes at indecent scenes.

## Ayat 31

- `And enjoin believing women to cast down their looks`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The commandments of restraining the gaze for women are the same as for men.
    - They should not glance intentionally at the other men, and if they happen to cast a chance look, they should turn their eyes away; and they should abstain from looking at the satar of others. 
    - *However, the commandments relating to the men's looking at women are a little different from those relating to the women’s looking at men.*
    - **On the one hand, there is an incident related in a tradition saying that Umm Salamah and Umm Maimunah, wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him), were sitting with him when lbn Umm Maktum, a blind companion, made his appearance. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to his wives: Conceal your faces from him. The wives said: O Messenger of Allah, is he not a blind man? Neither will he see us nor recognize us. Thereupon the Prophet (peace be upon him) remarked: Are you two also blind? Do you not see him? Umm Salamah has clarified that this incident occurred at a time when the commandments about the observance of hijab had already been sent down. (Ahmad, Abu Daud, Tirmizi).**
    - **This is also supported by a tradition in Muatta saying that a blind man came to see Aishah and she observed hijab from him. When asked as to why she observed hijab when the man could not see her, she replied: But I do see him.**
    - **On the other hand, there is a different tradition from Aishah. In 7 A.H. a deputation of the Africans came to Al-Madinah and they gave a performance of physical skill in the compound of the Prophet’s Mosque. The Prophet (peace be upon him) himself showed their performance to Aishah. (Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmad).**
    - **In another case, we find that when Fatimah bint Qais was irrevocably divorced by her husband, the question arose as to where she should pass her Iddah (the prescribed waiting term after divorce or death of husband). The Prophet (peace be upon him) first told her to stay with Umm Sharik Ansari, but then instructed her to stay in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, where she could stay with greater freedom as he was a blind man. He did not approve of her staying in the house of Umm Sharik because she was a rich lady and her house was frequented by the companions whom she entertained generously. (Muslim, Abu Daud).**
    - Read together these traditions show that the restrictions about the women’s looking at men are not so hard as about the men’s looking at women. While it is forbidden for women to sit face to face with men, it is not unlawful if they cast a look at men while passing on the way or see a harmless performance by them from a distance. There is also no harm for women to see the other men in case of real need if they are living in the same house. Imam Ghazzali and lbn Hajar Asqalani have also reached almost the same conclusion. Shaukani in his Nail al-Autar (Vol. Vl, p. 101) has quoted Ibn Hajar as saying: **Such a permission in respect of women is also supported by the fact that they have always enjoyed this type of freedom in outdoor duties while they came out veiled when visiting the mosques, or moving in the streets, or during the journey, so that men may not gaze at them, the men were never commanded to use the veil so that women may not gaze at them. This shows that the commandments in respect of the two sexes are different.. However, it is not at all permissible that women should gaze leisurely at men and draw pleasure of the eye in doing so.**
- `and guard their private parts`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they should abstain from illicit gratification of their sex desire as well as from exposing their satar before others. 
    - Though the commandments for men in this respect are the same as for women, *the boundaries of satar for women are different from those prescribed for men.*
    - Moreover, the female satar with respect to men is different from that with respect to women.
    - **The female satar with respect to men is the entire body, excluding only the hand and the face, which should not be exposed before any other man, not even the brother and father, except the husband.**
    - The woman is not allowed to wear a thin or a tight fitting dress which might reveal the skin or the outlines of the body.
    - **According to a tradition from Aishah, once her sister Asma came before the Prophet (peace be upon him) in a thin dress. The Prophet (peace be upon him) immediately turned his face away and said: O Asma, when a woman has attained her maturity, it is not permissible that any part of her body should be exposed except the face and the hand. (Abu Daud).**
    - **Ibn Jarir has related a similar incident from Aishah saying that once the daughter of Abdullah bin Tufail, who was her mother’s son from her former husband, came to her house on a visit. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) entered the house, he saw her but turned his face to the other side. Aishah said: O Messenger of Allah, she is my niece. Thereupon the Prophet (peace be upon him) remarked: When a woman reaches the age of puberty, it is not lawful for her to display her body except the hand and the face. (Then he indicated what he meant by the hand by gripping his own hand from the wrist so that there was hardly a breadth left between his grip and the palm of the hand).**
      - The only relaxation permitted in this connection is that a woman can uncover only that much of her body before her close relatives (for example, her brother, father, etc.) as is absolutely necessary for attending to the household duties. For instance, she can roll up her sleeves while kneading the flour, or tuck up her trousers while washing the floor.
    - **The boundaries of female satar with respect to women are the same as the boundaries of the male satar with respect to men, which is the part of the body from the navel to the knee. This does not, however, mean that a woman should appear half naked before other women. It only means that while it is obligatory to keep the part of body from the navel to the knee duly covered, it is not so in case of other parts.**
- `and not reveal their adornment`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It should be carefully noted that the demands that divine law makes from women are not only those it has made from men, that is restraining of looks and guarding of the private parts, but it makes some other demands from them also, which it has not made from men. This shows that men and women are not identical in this respect.
    - Adornment includes attractive clothes, ornaments and other decorations of the head, face, hand, feet, etc. which the women usually employ, and is expressed by the modern word **make-up**. The injunction that this makeup should not be displayed before others is discussed in detail in the following notes.
- `except that which is revealed of itself,`
- `and to draw their veils over their bosoms,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Different interpretations given by different commentators of this verse have greatly confused its real meaning.
    - All that is obviously meant is that women should not display their make-up and adornment except that which is displayed of itself and is beyond their control.
    - This clearly means that women should not purposely and intentionally display their make-up, but there is no accountability if the make-up becomes displayed without any purpose or intention on their part; for instance, the head-wrapper’s being blown aside by the wind thus exposing the adornment, or the outer-garment itself which cannot be concealed but which nevertheless has attraction being a part of the female dress.
      - This very interpretation of this verse has been given by Abdullah bin Masud, Hasan Basri, Ibn Sirin and Ibrahim Nakhai.
    - On the contrary, some other commentators have interpreted the verse to mean all those parts of the body which usually remain exposed or uncovered and in this they include the hands and the face with all their adornments.
      - This is the view of Ibn Abbas and his followers, and a large number of the Hanafi jurists have accepted it. (Ahkam-ul-Quran, AlJassas, Vol. III, pp. 388-389).
      - Thus, according to them, it is permissible for a woman to move out freely with the uncovered face in full make-up and adornment of the hands.
- `and not to reveal their adornment save to their husbands,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - We are, however, unable to subscribe to this view.
    - There is a world of difference between displaying something and its becoming displayed of itself.
    - The first implies intention and the second compulsion and a state of helplessness.
    - Moreover, such an interpretation also goes against the traditions which state that the women never moved out with open and uncovered faces in the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) after the commandments of hijab had been sent down.
    - These commandments implied veiling of the face as well, and the veil had become a part of the female dress except during Hajj when one has to be in the prescribed state of ihram and keep the face uncovered.
    - Another argument that is advanced in support of this view is that the hands and the face are not included in the satar of the woman, whereas satar and hijab are two entirely different things.
    - Sanctity of satar is such that it cannot be violated even before the mahram males like the father, brother, etc.
    - As for hijab it is over and above satar which is meant to segregate women from non mahram males; the discussion here relates to the commandments of hijab and not to satar.
    - In the pre-lslamic days of ignorance, women used to wear a sort of head-band, which was tied in a knot at the rear of the head. The slit of the shirt in the front partly remained open exposing the front of the neck and the upper part of the bosom. There was nothing except the shirt to cover the breasts, and the hair was worn in a couple or two of plaits hanging behind like tails. (AI-Kashshaf, Vol. II, p. 90, and Ibn Kathir, Vol. III, pp. 283-284).
    - At the revelation of this verse, the head-wrapper was introduced among the Muslim women, which was meant to cover the head, the breasts, and the back, completely.
    - The way the Muslim women responded to this command has been described by Aishah in a vivid manner.
      - **She states that when Surah An- Noor was revealed and the people learned of its contents from the Prophet (peace be upon him), they immediately went back to their houses and recited the verses before their wives, daughters and sisters. There was an instantaneous response. The Ansar women, one and all, immediately got up and made wrappers from whatever piece of cloth that was handy. The next morning all the women who came to the Prophet’s Mosque for prayers were dressed in wrappers. In another tradition Aishah says that thin cloth was discarded and the women selected only coarse cloth for the purpose.**
        - (lbn Kathir, Vol. III, p. 284, Abu Daud).
    - The very nature and object of the command demanded that the wrapper should not be made out of fine and thin cloth. The Ansar women immediately understood the real object and knew what type of cloth was intended to be used. The Law-Giver himself clarified this and did not leave it to be interpreted by the people.
    - **Dihya Kalbi states: Once a length of fine Egyptian muslin was presented to the Prophet (peace be upon him). He gave a piece of it to me and said, Use one part of it for your shirt, and give the rest of it to your wife for a wrapper, but tell her that she should stitch another piece of cloth on the inner side so that the body may not be displayed through it. (Abu Daud).**
    - This verse describes the circle in which a woman can move freely with all her make-up and adornment. Outside this circle she is not allowed to appear with make-up before the other people, whether they are relatives or strangers. The commandment implies that she should not display her embellishments outside this limited circle, intentionally or through carelessness. However, what becomes displayed incidentally, in spite of care and concern, or what cannot be concealed, it is excused by Allah. 
- `or their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Fathers’ include grandfathers and great grandfathers as well, both paternal and maternal. Accordingly a woman can appear before her own and her husband’s grandfathers just as she can appear before her own father and father in law.
- `or of their own sons, or the sons of their husbands,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Sons include grandsons and great grandsons from the male or female offspring. No distinction is to be made between the real sons and the step-sons.
- `or their brothers,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Brothers' include real and stepbrothers.
- `or the sons of their brothers, or the sons of their sisters,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Sons of brothers and sisters include sons, grandsons and great grandsons of all the three kinds of brothers and sisters.
- `or the women with whom they associate,13`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - After the relatives, the other people are now being mentioned. But before we proceed further, it would be useful to understand three things in order to avoid confusion.
      1. First, some jurists hold that the freedom of movement and display of adornment by a woman is restricted to the circle of relatives mentioned in this verse. All others, even the real paternal and maternal uncles, are excluded from this list and a woman should observe hiab from them because they have not been mentioned in the Quran. This is, however, not a correct view. Let alone the real uncles, the Prophet (peace be upon him) disallowed Aishah to observe hijab even from her foster uncles. **A tradition quoted in Sihah Sitta and Musnad Ahmad on the authority of Aishah says that once Aflah, brother of Abul Quais, came to see her and sought permission to enter the house. But since the commandment of hijab had been received, Hadrat Aishah refused him permission. On this Aflah sent back the word saying, You are my niece: you were suckled by my brother Abul Quais’s wife. But Aishah still was hesitant whether it was permissible to appear unveiled before such a relative or not. In the meantime the Prophet (peace be upon him) arrived and he ruled that he could see her. This shows that the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself did not interpret the verse in the way these jurists do that it was lawful to appear unveiled only before those relatives who have been mentioned in the verse and not before others. He interpreted it to mean that hijab need not be observed from those relatives with whom marriage is prohibited, for instance, paternal and maternal uncles, son-in-law and foster relatives. Hasan Basri from among the followers has expressed the same opinion and the same has been supported by Allama Abu Bakr al-Jassas in his Ahkam-ul- Quran.** (Vol. III, p. 390).
      2. Secondly, **there is the question of those relatives with whom marriage is not permanently prohibited;** they neither fall in the category of mahram relatives (that women may freely appear before them with adornment) nor in the category of complete strangers that they should observe full hijab from them as from others. What should be the right course between the two extremes has not been determined by the Shariah for such a course cannot possibly be determined. The observance of hijab or otherwise in such cases will inevitably depend on the mutual relationship, age of the woman and of men, family relations and contacts and other circumstances (e.g. residence in the same house or in different houses). **The personal example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself in this matter gives us the same guidance. A large number of traditions confirm that Asma, daughter of Abu Bakr, who was a sister-in-law of the Prophet (peace be upon him), appeared unveiled before him and no hijab, at least of the face and hands, was observed by her. This same position continued till the Farewell Pilgrimage which took place just a few months before the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him)**. (Abu Daud). Similarly **Umm Hani, daughter of Abu Talib and a first cousin of the Prophet (peace be upon him), appeared before him till the end without ever observing hijab of the face and hands. She herself has narrated an incident pertaining to the conquest of Makkah, which confirms the same. (Abu Daud)**. On the contrary, **we see that Abbas sends his son Fadal, and Rabiah bin Harith bin Abdul Muttalib, a first cousin of the Prophet (peace be upon him), his son Abdul Muttalib before the Prophet (peace be upon him) with the request for a job, as they could not be married till they became earning members of the family. They both see the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the house of his wife Zainab, who is a first cousin of Fadal and is similarly related to the father of Abdul Muttalib bin Rabiah. But she does not appear before them and talks to them from behind a curtain in the presence of the Prophet (peace be upon him). (Abu Daud)**. Taking the two kinds of precedents together we come to the same conclusion as we have stated above.
      3. Thirdly, **in cases where the relationship itself becomes doubtful, hijab should be observed even from the mahram relatives.** Bukhari, Muslim and Abu Daud have related a case where **Saudah, a wife of the Prophet (peace be upon him), had a brother born of a slave woman. Utbah, the father of Saudah and the boy, left a will enjoining his brother, Saad bin Abi Waqqas, to look after the boy as a nephew for he was from his own seed. When the case came before the Prophet (peace be upon him), he rejected the claim of Saad, saying: The boy belongs to him on whose bed he was born; as for the adulterer, let stones and pebbles be his lot. But at the same time he told Saudah to observe hijab from the boy because it was doubtful whether he was really her brother.**
- `or those that are in their bondage,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Arabic word nisa-i-hinna means their female associates. Before we consider what women are exactly meant, it is worth noting that the word used here is not annisa, which merely means women, but nisa-i-hinna which means their female associates. In the former case, it would be quite permissible for a Muslim woman to appear unveiled before all sorts of women and display her adornment. The use of nisa-i-hinna, however, has circumscribed her freedom within a specific circle. As to what specific circle of women is implied, the commentators and jurists have expressed different opinions.
- `or the male attendants in their service free of sexual interest,`
- `or boys that are yet unaware of illicit matters pertaining to women.`
- `Nor should they stamp their feet on the ground in such manner that their hidden ornament becomes revealed.`
- **`Believers, turn together, all of you, to Allah in repentance that you may attain true success.`**

## Ayat 32

- `Marry those of you that are single, (whether men or women),`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word ayama is the plural of ayyim which means a single person, and is applicable to every man who is without a wife and to every woman who is without a husband.
- `and those of your male and female slaves that are righteous.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, those who show the right attitude in their dealings with you and in whom you find the capability of discharging the responsibilities of married life.
    - The owner whose slave does not show the right attitude nor seems to possess the necessary capability and temper to lead a reasonably happy married life, has not been required to arrange his or her marriage.
    - For in that case he would become the cause of ruining another person’s life.
    - This condition, however, has not been imposed on free persons because in their case the people who promote marriages are no more than mere advisers, associates and introducers. The actual marriage depends on the mutual willingness of the bride and the bridegroom. 
    - In the case of a slave, however, the entire responsibility lies on the owner, and if he makes the mistake of marrying a poor person with an ill-natured, ill-mannered spouse, the responsibility for the consequences will be entirely his.
- `If they are poor, Allah will enrich them out of His Bounty.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This does not mean that Allah will certainly bestow wealth on anybody who marries.
    - **The intention is to discourage a calculative approach.**
    - This instruction is both for the parents of the girl and of the boy.
    - The former should not reject a pious and virtuous suitor merely because he happens to be poor. Similarly the boy's parents should not go on postponing his marriage because he is not yet a full earning member or is not yet earning sufficiently.
    - **Young men have been advised not to go on postponing their marriage unnecessarily waiting for better times even if the income is not yet sufficient, one should marry with full faith in Allah.** 
    - Very often the marriage itself becomes the cause of improving strained circumstances. The wife helps to control the family budget, or the husband starts to exert himself more to meet the new challenges and responsibilities. The wife can also earn to supplement the family budget. Then, who knows what the future holds in store for him. Good times can change into bad times and bad into good.
    - **One should therefore refrain from being too calculative in this regard.**
- `Allah is Immensely Resourceful, All-Knowing.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The imperative mood of the verb “Marry: Arrange marriages....the righteous”, has led some scholars to assume that it is obligatory to arrange such marriages; whereas the nature of the problem indicates that it cannot be so.
  - Obviously it cannot be obligatory for somebody to arrange the marriage of the other person.
  - Marriage is not a onesided affair;
  - it needs another party also.
  - If it were obligatory, what would be the position of the person who is going to be married? Should he willingly accept to be married wherever others arrange it? If so, it would mean that he or she had absolutely no choice in the matter. And if the one has a right to refuse, how are the others going to discharge their responsibility? 
  - **Taking all these aspects into account the majority of the jurists have held that the commandment is not obligatory but recommendatory.** 
  - *The intention is that the Muslims should ensure that none in the society should remain unmarried.*
  - The people of the house, friends and neighbors, all should take necessary interest in the matter, and where no such help is available, the state should make necessary arrangements.

## Ayat 33

- `Let those who cannot afford to marry keep themselves chaste until Allah enriches them out of His Bounty.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The best commentary on these verses are the traditions which have been reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in this connection.
    - **Abdullah bin Masud has related that the Prophet (peace be upon him) once said: O young men, whoso among you can afford to marry, he should marry, because this will be a means of restraining the eyes from casting the evil look and of keeping one pure and chaste, and the one who cannot afford, should fast, because fasting helps cool down the passions. (Bukhari, Muslim).**
    - According to Abu Hurairah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Allah has taken upon Himself to succor three men:
      - (a) the one who marries with a view to guarding his chastity, 
      - (b) the slave who works to earn his freedom,
      - (c) the one who goes out to fight in the way of Allah."
        - (Tirmizi, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Ahmad)
        - For further explanation, see (Surah An-Nisa, Ayat 25).
- `And write out a deed of manumission for such of your slaves that desire their freedom`
  - Mukatabat as a term means a deed of emancipation between the owner and the slave entitling the latter to earn his or her freedom after payment of an agreed sum of money in a certain period.
  - This is one of the methods laid down in Islam for the slaves to attain their freedom.
  - It is not essential that the slave must always pay in cash; he can also earn his freedom by rendering some special service to the owner, provided that both the parties agree. Once the agreement is signed, the owner is not entitled to put any obstacles in the way of the slave’s freedom. He will have to provide opportunities to enable him to earn for his emancipation and shall have to free him when the agreed amount has been paid in time.
  - **In the time of Umar, a slave entered into such an agreement with his lady owner, but managed to collect the amount in advance of the time limit. When the amount was offered to the lady, she refused to accept it on the ground that she would like to have it in monthly and yearly installments. The slave complained to Umar who ordered that the amount be deposited in the state treasury and the slave be set free. The lady was informed that her money lay in the treasury and she had the option to take it in a lump sum or in yearly or monthly installments. (Daraqutni).**
- `in lieu of payment`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - A group of jurists have interpreted this as “execute the deed of emancipation with them”, that it is obligatory for the owner to accept the offer of a slave to earn his emancipation.
    - This is the view of Ata, Amr bin Dinar Ibn Sirin, Masruq, Dahhak, Ikrimah, the Zahiriyyah and Ibn Jarir Tabari, and Imam Shafai also favoured it in the beginning.
    - The other group holds that it is not obligatory but only recommendatory and commendable. This group includes jurists like Shabi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Hasan Basri, Abdul Rahman bin Zaid, Sufyan Thauri, Abu Hanifah and Malik bin Anas and Imam Shafai later on also had adopted this view. The first view is supported by two things:
      - (a) The imperative mood of the verb to execute the deed suggests that it is a command front Allah.
      - (b) **Authentic traditions contain the incident that when Sirin, father of Muhammad bin Sirin, the great jurist and traditionalist, made a request to his master Anas for a deed of emancipation, the latter refused to accept it. Sirin took the matter before Umar, who whip in hand turned to Anas, saying: Allah’s command is that you execute the deed. (Bukhari)**.
      - From this it has been argued that it was not a discretionary and personal decision of Umar but it was taken in the presence of the companions and none expressed any difference of opinion. This therefore should be taken as an authentic interpretation of the verse.
- `- if you see any good in them -`
- `and give them out of the wealth that Allah has given you.`
- `And do not compel your slave-girls to prostitution for the sake of the benefits of worldly life the while they desire to remain chaste.`
- `And if anyone compels them to prostitution, Allah will be Most Pardoning, Much Merciful (to them) after their subjection to such compulsion.`

## Ayat 34

- `Verily We have sent down for you revelations which clearly expound true guidance,`
- `and examples of those who passed away before you,`
- `and an admonition for those who fear (Allah).`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse is not only connected with the verse immediately preceding it but with the entire discourse right from the beginning. 
  - Revelations giving clear guidance are those verses which:
    1. State the law concerning zina, qazf and lian.
    2. Forbid the believers to marry impure men or women.
    3. Prohibit the slandering of chaste people and propagating indecencies in society.
