**Ayat  51 - 57**

## Ayat 51

- `When those that believe are called to Allah and His Messenger in order that he (that is, the Messenger) may judge their disputes among them, nothing becomes them but to say:`
  - **`"We hear and we obey."`**
- `Such shall attain true success.`

## Ayat 52

- `Those who obey Allah and His Messenger and fear Him and avoid disobeying Him: such, indeed, shall triumph.`

## Ayat 53

- `(The hypocrites) solemnly swear by Allah:`
  - `"If you order us, we shall surely go forth (and fight in the cause of Allah)."`
- `Tell them:`
  - `"Do not swear.`
  - `The state of your obedience is known.1`
  - `Allah is well aware of all that you do."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, you might succeed in deceiving the people, but you cannot deceive Allah, Who is aware of everything, open or hidden, even of your innermost motives and intentions.

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The verse may also mean that the obedience expected of the believers is of recognized and well known type, which is above every kind of suspicion, and not such as may need swearing of oaths to convince others of its sincerity. Their conduct is manifest and everybody who comes into contact with them feels that they are truly obedient to Allah and His Prophet.

## Ayat 54

- `Say:`
  - `"Obey Allah and obey the Messenger.`
  - `But if you turn away, then (know well) that the Messenger is responsible for what he has been charged with and you are responsible for what you have been charged with.`
  - `But if you obey him, you will be guided to the Right Way.`
  - `The Messenger has no other responsibility but to clearly convey (the command)."`

## Ayat 55

- `Allah has promised those of you who believe and do righteous deeds that`
- `He will surely bestow power on them in the land even as He bestowed power on those that preceded them, and that`
- `He will firmly establish their religion which He has been pleased to choose for them, and`
- `He will replace with security the state of fear that they are in.`
- `Let them serve Me and associate none with Me in My Divinity.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - As has been hinted in the beginning of this discourse, this means to warn the hypocrites that the promise of Allah to bestow successorship in the land is not meant for those people who are Muslims only in name, but for those who are true in faith, pious in character, sincere in devotion and who follow Allah’s religion in letter and spirit eschewing every tinge of shirk. Those who lack these qualities and pay mere lip service to Islam are neither worthy of this promise nor its addressees. Therefore they should entertain no hope of having any share in it.
- `Whoso thereafter engages in unbelief, such indeed are the ungodly.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Some people interpret Khilafat (successorship in the land) to mean political power and authority, and conversely conclude that whosoever possesses power and authority in the land is necessarily a true believer and a follower of Allah’s approved religion and His devotee, free from all traces of shirk. Then in order to get support for their wrong conclusion, they even change the very meanings of faith, virtue, divine creed, Allah’s worship, idolatry, etc. to suit their interpretation. **This is the worst distortion of the meaning of the Quran**, even worse than what the Jews and Christians did with their Scriptures. **This interpretation of the verse tends to destroy the very message of the Quran**.
  - If successorship in the land were to mean mere power and authority in the land; then all those people who wielded power and authority in the world, or wield it today, would fit in with the description contained in the verse, even if they denied Allah, revelations, Prophethood, life in the Hereafter, and were involved in all kinds of major sins like usury, adultery, drinking and gambling. Now if all such people are regarded as pious believers and considered worthy of holding the high offices because of their qualities as such, then faith would imply simple obedience to physical laws and virtue would mean making use of those laws effectively and successfully. Allah’s approved religion would mean making maximum progress in the fields of industry and trade, commerce and politics by achieving excellence in the physical sciences; devotion to Allah would mean abiding by the rules and procedures which are naturally useful and essential for success in individual and collective enterprises; and shirk would mean adopting a few harmful methods also along with the useful procedures and rules.
  - But the question is: Would a person who has studied the Quran with an open heart and mind ever believe that the terms faith, righteous deeds, true religion, devotion to Allah, tauhid and shirk as used in the Quran really mean this? As a matter of fact, such a meaning can be understood either by the one who has never made an intelligent study of the Quran as a whole, but has picked up verses from here and there and given them his own biased meaning according to preconceived notions and theories, or by the one who has read the Quran through but has all along been holding all those verses as wrong and absurd, which invite people to accept Allah as the One and only Lord, His revelations as the only source of guidance, His Messengers as the only true guides worthy of absolute obedience, and which demand not only belief in the lifeafter- death, but also state that the people who would consider success in the worldly life as their sole and ultimate objective, without any idea of their accountability in the Hereafter, would be deprived of real success.
  - The Quran has repeated these themes so frequently in diverse ways and in such clear and plain language that it is difficult to believe that anybody who studies it honestly can ever be involved in those misunderstandings in which the modern interpreters of this verse have been involved. **The fact is that they have misconstrued Khilafat and Istikhlaf (successorship) after their own notions, which cannot be held as correct by anybody who has some knowledge of the Quran.**
