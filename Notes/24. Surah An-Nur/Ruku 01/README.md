**Ayat  01 - 10**


## Ayat 1

- `This is a surah which We have revealed,`
- `and which We have made obligatory;`
- `We have revealed in it clear instructions`
- `so that you may take heed.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In all these sentences the emphasis is on We, which implies that it is Allah Who has revealed this and none else; therefore: You should not treat these instructions lightly like the word of an ordinary preacher.
  - You should note it well that these have been sent down by One Who controls your lives and destinies and from Whom you can never escape even after your death.


## Ayat 2

- `Those who fornicate - whether female or male - flog each one of them with a hundred lashes.`
- `And let not tenderness for them deter you from what pertains to Allah's religion,if you do truly believe in Allah and the Last Day;`
- `and let a party of believers witness their punishment.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There are various legal, moral and historical aspects of this problem which need explanation, for if these are not clarified in detail, the modern man will find it difficult to understand the divine law concerning it.
  - Accordingly, we shall discuss the various aspects of the problem below.
    1. The common meaning of zina which everyone knows is sexual intercourse between a man and a woman without the legal relationship of husband and wife existing between them.
       - There has been complete unanimity of view among all the social systems from the earliest times to this day that this act is morally wicked, religiously sinful and socially evil and objectionable, and there has been no dissenting voice except from those stray individuals who have subordinated their moral sense to their lust, or who in their misguided notions try to be original and philosophical in their approach.
       - The universal unanimity of view in this respect is due to the fact that man by nature abhors zina. In fact, the future of human race and civilization depends on this that the relationship between the husband and wife should be built upon the basis of an enduring and everlasting bond of fidelity, which should not only be fully recognized in the social life but should also be guaranteed by the existing social structure. 
       - Without this the human race cannot survive. This is because the human child requires years of tender care and training for survival and development and a woman alone cannot bear the burden without the cooperation of the man who became the cause of the birth of the child.
       - Similarly human civilization itself is the product of the corporate life of a man and a woman, their setting up a home, bringing up a family, and establishing mutual relationships and inter-connections between families. If men and women were to lose sight of this essential fact, that is, the establishment of a home and raising a family, and were to meet freely just for pleasure and lust, the entire structure of human society would crumble. In fact, the very foundations on which the structure of human civilization and culture has been built will topple down and the whole basis of the concept of a social life will disappear.
       - It is for these reasons that free mixing of men and women, without any recognized and stable bonds of fidelity, is abhorrent to human nature, and it is for this reason that in every age zina has been considered as a moral evil and, in religious terminology, a grave sin.
       - Accordingly, the social systems in every age recognized and adopted the institution of marriage and also adopted preventive measures against adultery or fornication. The forms of the measures adopted in this direction have, however, differed under different social, cultural and religious systems. This difference has been the result of the realization of the disastrous effects of adultery (or fornication) in varying degrees: some societies have considered it to be more heinous than others, and some have conceived it clearly and some others not so clearly and confused it with other problems.
    2. Though adultery (or fornication) has always been accepted as an evil, opinion has differed as to whether it is legally a punishable offense or not, and this is where Islam differs from other religions and systems of law. Social systems which have been akin to human nature have always considered illicit intercourse between man and woman a serious crime and prescribed severe punishments for it. But with the deterioration in moral standards, this morality grew weaker and weaker and the attitude towards this crime became more and more tolerant.


## Ayat 3

- `Let the fornicator not marry any except a fornicatress or idolatress and let the fornicatress not marry any except a fornicator or an idolater.`
- `That is forbidden to the believers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, only an adulterous woman is a fit match for an adulterous man who has not repented or an idolatrous woman. No believing, virtuous woman can be a match for him. It is forbidden for the believers that they should give their daughters in marriage to such wicked people knowing them to be so. 
  - Similarly the fit match for adulterous women (who have not repented) can only be adulterous or idolatrous men; they are not fit for any righteous believer. It is forbidden for the believers that they should marry women who are known to possess immoral character. 
  - **This thing applies to those men and women who persist in their evil ways, and not to those who repent and reform themselves, for after repentance and reformation they will no longer be regarded as adulterous.**

## Ayat 4

- `Those who accuse honourable women (of unchastity) but do not produce four witnesses,`
- `flog them with eighty lashes,`
- **`and do not admit their testimony ever after.`**
- `They are indeed transgressors,`

## Ayat 5

- `except those of them that repent thereafter and mend their behaviour.`
- **`For surely Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever Compassionate.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Allah is the most merciful of all.

## Ayat 6

- **`As for those who accuse their wives (of unchastity), and have no witnesses except themselves: the testimony of such a one is that he testify, swearing by Allah four times, that he is truthful (in his accusation),`**

## Ayat 7

- **`and a fifth time, that the curse of Allah be on him if he be lying (in his accusation).`**

## Ayat 8

- **`And the punishment shall be averted from the woman if she were to testify, swearing by Allah four times that the man was lying,`**

## Ayat 9

- **`and a fifth time that the wrath of Allah be on her if the man be truthful (in his accusation).`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - These verses were revealed some time after the preceding verses. 
  - The law of qazf prescribed the punishment for the person who accused the other man or woman of zina, and did not produce witnesses to prove his charge, but the question naturally arose, **what should a man do if he finds his own wife involved in zina?**
  - If he kills her, he will be guilty of murder and punishable. If he goes to get witnesses, the offender might escape. If he tries to ignore the matter, he cannot do so for long. He can, of course, divorce the woman, but in this case there will be no moral or physical punishment either for the woman or her seducer. And if the illicit intercourse results in pregnancy, he will have to suffer the burden of bringing up another personâ€™s child.
  - **Initially this question was raised by Saad bin Ubadah as a hypothetical case, who said that if he happened to see such a thing in his own house, he would not go in search of witnesses, but would settle the matter there and then with the sword. (Bukhari, Muslim).**
  - But soon afterwards actual cases were brought before the Prophet (peace be upon him) by the husbands who were eyewitnesses of this thing.
  - **According to traditions related by Abdullah bin Masud and Ibn Umar, an Ansar Muslim (probably Uwaimir Ajlani) came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, if a person finds another man with his wife, and utters an accusation, you will enforce the prescribed punishment of qazf on him; if he commits murder, you will have him killed; if he keeps quiet, he will remain involved in anguish; then, what should he do? At this the Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed: O Allah, give a solution of this problem. (Muslim, Bukhari, Abu Daud, Ahmad, Nasai).**
  - **Ibn Abbas has reported that Hilal bin Umayyah presented the case of his wife whom he had himself witnessed involved in the act of sin. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Bring your proof, otherwise you will have the prescribed punishment of qazf inflicted on you. At this a panic spread among the companions, and Hilai said: I swear by Allah Who has sent you as a Prophet that I am speaking the truth. I have seen it with my eyes and heard it with my ears. I am sure Allah will send down a command, which will protect my back (from the punishment). So, this verse was revealed. (Bukhari, Ahmad, Abu Daud).**
  - The legal procedure which has been laid down in this verse is termed as the **law of lian**.


## Ayat 10

- `Were it not for Allah's Bounty and His Mercy unto you and that Allah is much prone to accept repentance and is Wise,`
- `(you would have landed yourselves into great difficulty on the question of unsubstantiated accusation of your spouses).`
