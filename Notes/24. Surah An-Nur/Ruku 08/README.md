**Ayat  58 - 61**

## Ayat 58

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - From here again, the commandments for social life are being resumed. It is just possible that this portion of Surah An-Noor was revealed at a later date.

- `Believers!`
- `At three times let those whom your right hands possess and those of your children`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - According to the majority of commentators and jurists, this refers to both male and female slaves. Ibn Umar and Mujahid, however, have expressed the opinion that it refers to the male slaves only. But in view of the commandment that follows there appears to be no reason for making this distinction.
    - Violation of one’s privacy by his children is as undesirable as by his female slaves. All jurists agree that the commandment given in this verse is applicable both to the minor and to the grown up slaves.
- `who have not yet reached puberty`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Another translation can be: Who have not yet reached the age of seeing wet dreams. From this the jurists have deduced the principle that in case of boys puberty starts when they begin having nocturnal emissions. But the translation that we have adopted is preferable because the injunction is meant both for boys and for girls. If nocturnal emission is taken as the sign of attaining puberty, the injunction would be confined to boys only, because in the case of girls it is the menstrual discharge, and not nocturnal emission, which marks the beginning of puberty. In our opinion the intention is that the children of the house should follow this procedure till the time that they become sex conscious. After they have become sex conscious they have to follow the injunction that follows.
- `ask leave of you before entering your quarters: before the Morning Prayer and when you take off your clothes at noon, and after the Night Prayer. These are the three times of privacy for you.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Literally aurat is a place of danger and trouble; it also means a private part of the body which one would not like to expose before others, and something which is not fully secured.
    - All these meanings are close to each other and all are implied in the meaning of this verse.
    - The verse means to say that these are your times of privacy when you are either alone or with your wives in a state when it is not proper for your children and servants to come in to see you unannounced. Therefore, they should be instructed that they must take your permission before coming in to see you in your places of privacy at these three times.
- `If they come to you at other times then there is no sin for them nor for you,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, at other times than these, there is no restriction on the entry of minor children and slaves in your private rooms without permission. If on such an occasion you are not properly dressed and they enter without permission, you will have no right to take them to task. For in that case, it will be your own folly to have kept yourself in an improper state at a time when you should have been properly dressed for the day’s business. However, if they enter without permission during the times of privacy, the blame will lie with them provided they have been taught the necessary etiquette.
- `for you have to visit one another frequently.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the reason for the general permission for children and slaves to come without permission at other times than those mentioned above. This throws light on a fundamental fiqh principle that every religious injunction is based on some wisdom or good reason, whether it has been explained or not.
- **`Thus does Allah clearly explain His directives to you.`**
- **`Allah is All- Knowing, All-Wise.`**

## Ayat 59

- `And when your children attain puberty`
- `let them ask leave to come to you like their elders used to ask leave.`
- **`Thus does Allah clearly explain to you His Signs.`**
- **`He is All-Knowing, All-Wise.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, when they have reached the age of puberty. As has been explained in E.N. 87 above, the signs of puberty in the case of boys and girls are nocturnal emission and menstrual discharge respectively.
  - There is, however, a difference of opinion among the jurists regarding the beginning of puberty in those boys and girls who for some reason do not show these physical signs for an unduly long time. 
  - According to Imam Shafai, Imam Abu Yusuf, Imam Muhammad and Imam Ahmad, a boy or a girl of 15 years will be considered to have attained puberty, and a saying of Imam Abu Hanifah also supports this view.
  - But the well known view of Imam Abu Hanifah is that in such cases the age of puberty will be 17 years for girls and 18 years for boys. 
  - Both these opinions are the result of juristic reasoning and neither is based on any injunction of the Quran or Sunnah. It is therefore not necessary that the age limits of 15 or 18 years be accepted as marking the beginning of puberty everywhere in the world in abnormal cases. In different countries and ages there are different conditions of physical development and growth. The age of puberty in a certain country can be determined by means of the law of averages in normal cases. As for abnormal cases, the mean difference of ages may be added to the upper age limit to determine the age of puberty. For instance, if in a country, the minimum and maximum ages for noctural discharge are normally 12 and 15 years respectively, the mean difference of one and a half years may be added to the maximum limit of 15 years to determine the beginning of puberty for abnormal cases. The same principle can be used by the legal experts of various countries to fix the age of puberty keeping in view their peculiar local conditions.

## Ayat 60

- `The women who are past their youth (and can no longer bear children) and do not look forward to marriage`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Literally, this means those women who are no longer capable of bearing children, who no longer cherish sexual desires, and who cannot excite the passions of men.
- `will incur no sin if they cast off their outer garments`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Obviously it cannot mean that they should strip themselves naked. That is why all the jurists and commentators agree that it implies the outer garments which are used to hide the adornments as enjoined in(Surah Al-Ahzab, Ayat 59).
- `without displaying their adornment.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Tabarruj is display and exhibitionism. When used with regard to a woman, it would imply the one who displays her charms and adornments before other men. The permission to lay aside the outer garments is being given to those old women who are no longer interested in personal embellishments and whose sex desires are gone. But if they still have a hidden desire smoldering in their hearts and an urge to display, they cannot avail of this permission.
- `But if they remain modest, that is still better for them.`
- **`Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.`**

## Ayat 61

- `There is no blame on the blind nor any blame on the lame nor any blame on the sick nor on yourselves that you eat in your own houses, or your fathers' houses, or your mothers' houses, or your brothers' houses, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your fathers' brothers or the houses of your fathers' sisters, or in the houses of your mothers' brothers, or in the houses of your mothers' sisters or in the houses whose keys you possess, or the house of a friend.`
- `There is no blame if you eat together or separately.`
- `But when you enter such houses, greet each other with a salutation appointed by Allah, a salutation that is blessed and good.`
- **`Thus, does Allah expound His signs to you in order that you will act with understanding.`**
