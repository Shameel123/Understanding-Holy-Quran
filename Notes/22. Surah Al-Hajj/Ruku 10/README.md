**Ayat  73 - 78**


## Ayat 73

- `O people, a parable is set forth: pay heed to it.`
- `Those who call upon aught other than Allah shall never be able to create even a fly, even if all of them were to come together to do that.`
- `And if the fly were to snatch away anything from them, they would not be able to recover that from it.`
- `Powerless is the supplicant; and powerless is he to whom he supplicates.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This parable has been cited to impress upon the idolworshipers that their deities are absolutely powerless, for even if they all collaborated to create an insignificant thing like a fly, they could not; nay, even if a fly snatched away anything from them they could not prevent it.
  - This shows how weak they themselves are and how powerless are the idols they supplicate.

## Ayat 74

- `They have not formed a true estimate of Allah.`
- `Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.`

## Ayat 75

- `Allah chooses Messengers from among angels and from among human beings (to convey His command).`
- `Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In continuation of the refutation of shirk, Allah has taken two kinds of the most revered of deities to show their real status, as if to say:
  - The angels and the Prophets whom you have set up as deities are mere Messengers of Allah. Allah has chosen them to convey His messages to human beings and this does not make them God or partners in His Godhead.

## Ayat 76

- `He knows all that is before them and that which is hidden from them.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Quran employs this sentence to refute the creed of the mushriks in regard to intercession, as if to say: You imagine that angels, prophets, saints and the like can intercede with Allah on your behalf and therefore you worship them. You are absolutely wrong. For none of your deities knows what is good for you and what is not. Allah alone hears everything, sees everything and knows everything. Therefore He has not given the right of intercession and recommendation to anyone except when He Himself is pleased to give such permission.
- `And it is to Allah that all affairs are returned.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is to impress upon them that every affair and every matter, big or small, is presented before Allah for a decision.
    - Therefore you should not invoke anyone else other than Allah, for all others are utterly helpless and powerless and cannot even fulfill their own desires and needs. 

## Ayat 77

- `Believers, bow down and prostrate yourselves before Your Lord and serve Your Lord and do good that you may prosper.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the right way of attaining the success, but even after adopting these ways of worship and performing good deeds one should not rest content or be proud that he would surely attain success because he is worshiping Allah and is doing good deeds.
  - He should only expect that Allah will by His grace accept his services and bless him with the success.

## Ayat 78

- `Strive in the cause of Allah in a manner worthy of that striving.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Arabic word jihad is very comprehensive. It includes every kind of effort, exertion, conflict and war.
    - Jihad for the cause of Allah means that it should be performed for His service and for His approval against those who prevent others from following His Way.
    - The performance of jihad also requires that one should first of all fight against his own self in order to subdue it. For there can be no true jihad unless one fights against his evil self and subdues his desires and lusts to the obedience of Allah.
    - **The Prophet (peace be upon him) himself has emphasized the need for this jihad. Once when the warriors for the cause of Allah returned from jihad, he said: You have returned from the lesser jihad to the greater jihad. They asked: What is that greater Jihad. The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: It is the jihad against his own desires and lusts.**
    - Moreover, the battlefield for jihad is, in fact, the whole world, and Islam demands that one should exert his utmost against all the rebels of Allah and the wicked powers with all of his heart and mind and body and wealth.
- `He has chosen you (for His task),`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The direct addressees of this were the companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him), for they were the first who had the honor to be chosen for this service; others have been addressed only indirectly being their followers. This thing has been mentioned in the Quran in other ways as well. For reference, see(Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 143) and(Surah Aal-Imran, Ayat 110).
- `and He has not laid upon you any hardship in religion.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “(Allah) has not placed upon you in religion any hardship”.
    - That is, the creed you have been given is very simple and straightforward and the laws and regulations you have to obey are practicable. You are free within its bounds to make as much progress as you can.
    - This was to impress that the lives of the Muslims were free from all those useless and unnatural restrictions which had been imposed upon the former communities by their priests and law givers.
    - The negative aspect of the same thing has been mentioned in(Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 157): He enjoins them to follow virtue and forbids them from evil: He makes pure things lawful for them and impure things unlawful. He relieves them of their burdens and frees them from the shackles that bound them.
- `Keep to the faith of your father Abraham.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Though Islam may be called the religion of Prophets Noah, Moses, Jesus, etc. yet the Quran emphasizes over and over again that it is the religion of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon them all). 
    - Therefore, you should follow it. This is for three reasons.
      - (1) The first addressees of the Quran were the Arabs who were more familiar with Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) than with any other Prophet and acknowledged him to be a holy personage and their leader.
      - (2) Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) alone was the person whom the Jews, the Christians, the Muslims and the mushriks of Arabia and of the adjoining countries unanimously acknowledged as a great Prophet.
- `Allah named you Muslims earlier and even in this (Book),`
- `that the Messenger may be a witness over you,`
- `and that you may be witnesses over all mankind.`
- `So establish Prayer, and pay Zakah, and hold fast to Allah.`
- **`He is your Protector.`**
- **`What an excellent Protector; what an excellent Helper!`**
