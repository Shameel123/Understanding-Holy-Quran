**Ayat  34 - 38**

## Ayat 34

- `For every people We have laid down a ritual of sacrifice (- although the purpose of the ritual is the same -)`
- `that they pronounce the name of Allah over the cattle He has provided them.`
- `Your Lord is One God;`
- `so submit yourselves to Him alone.`
- `And give, (O Prophet), glad tidings to those that humble themselves (before Allah),`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse implies two things.
    - (1) Sacrifice has been an essential part of the worship of One Allah in all the revealed religions. In order to inculcate Tauhid, Allah prohibited sacrifice for anyone other than Himself.
      - This was in keeping with the other prohibitions which were made for others than Allah.
      - For instance, prostration before anyone other than Allah, making vows for others than Allah, visiting holy places others than those prescribed by Allah, fasting in the name of others than of Allah, etc., were all prohibited.

## Ayat 35

- `whose hearts shiver whenever Allah is mentioned,`
- `who patiently bear whatever affliction comes to them,`
- `who establish Prayer,`
- `and who spend (for good purposes) out of what We have provided them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It means that righteous people spend their lawful provisions in the way of Allah to meet their own and their dependents’ lawful needs, to help their relatives, neighbors and other needy people, on public works and propagation of the word of Allah.
  - It does not include expenditure in unlawful ways for unlawful purposes. The Quranic term lnfaq implies neither over spending nor being miserly and stingy, but spending one’s wealth on himself and others according to his means and status in society.

## Ayat 36

- `We have appointed sacrificial camels`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Seven persons can become partners in the sacrifice of one camel and likewise in the sacrifice of one cow and the like, as enjoined by the Prophet (peace be upon him) in a tradition reported by Jabir bin Abdullah in the collection of Hadith by Muslim.
- `among the symbols of (devotion to) Allah.`
- `There is much good in them for you.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you should sacrifice animals because you get many benefits from them to show your gratitude to Allah, the Giver, and also to acknowledge His Supremacy and Sovereignty.
- `So make them stand (at the time of sacrifice)`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Mention the name of Allah over them” implies that animals should be slaughtered by pronouncing the name of Allah over them, because without that their flesh would be unlawful to eat.
    - This shows that in the Islamic Law there is no conception of slaughtering an animal without pronouncing the name of Allah over it. According to traditions, there are different wordings for pronouncing the name of Allah over the animals at the time of their slaughter. Some of these are:
    - (1) **Bismillahi Allahu Akbar; Allahumma minka wa laka:**
         - In the name of Allah, Allah is most Great! O Allah, this is Thine and is presented to Thee.
    - (2) **Allahu Akbar- La ilaha ill-Allahu; Allahumma minka wa laka:**   
      - Allah is most Great: There is no god but Allah: O Allah, this is Thine and is presented to Thee.
    - (3) **Inni wajjahtu wajhiya lillazi fatar-as-sama wati wal-arda, hanif-an-wa ma ana min-al-mushrikin. Inns Salati wa nusuki wa mahyaya wa mamati lillahi Rabb-il-alamin. La sharika lahu wa bi-zalika umirtu wa ana min-al-Muslimin. A llahumma minks wa laka.**
      - I have turned my face sincerely towards the Being Who created the heavens and the earth, and I am not from among the idolatrous people. My Salat and my rites of worship and my life and my death are all for Allah, the Lord of the universe, Who has no partner with Him. This is what I have been enjoined and I am the first to surrender to Him. O Allah! This is Thine, and is presented to Thee.
- `and pronounce the name of Allah over them,`
- `and when they fall down on their sides(after they are slaughtered),`
- `eat and also feed them who do not ask and those who ask.`
- `Thus have We subjected these animals that you may give thanks.`

## Ayat 37

- **`Neither their flesh reaches Allah nor their blood; it is your piety that reaches Him.`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This prescribes a very important condition for the sacrifice made in the worship of Allah.
    - A sacrifice is acceptable to Allah only if it is accompanied by piety and sincerity.
    - Though sacrifice is a symbol of Allah, yet it has been made plain that it is accepted only if it is accompanied by piety, saying: **“Neither their meat that reaches Allah nor their blood, but what reaches Him is the piety from you”.**
    - This was also meant to condemn the ritual of the days of ignorance, when the Arabs took the flesh to the Kabah and smeared its walls with the blood of the sacrificed animal.
- `He has subjected these animals (to you) that you may magnify Allah for the guidance He has bestowed upon you.`
- `Give glad tidings, (O Prophet), to those who do good.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **“That you may glorify Allah”** at the time of sacrifice verbally also in order to acknowledge that the animals really belong to Allah and to no one else.
    - One of the sentences uttered at the time of sacrifice is **Allahumma minka wa laka (O Allah, this animal is Thine and is presented to Thee)**.

## Ayat 38

- `Surely`
- `Allah defends those who believe.`
- `Certainly Allah has no love for the perfidious, the thankless.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - From here the address for the first time prepares the Muslims for Jihad.
  - In order to understand this, we should keep in view the preceding portion (verses 19-24) in which the ideological conflict between the two parties (believers and disbelievers) and the result thereof have been described.
  - This naturally serves as a prelude to the armed conflict between the two parties.
  - That is why in (verses 26- 37) the immediate causes which necessitated war have been stated to serve as an introduction and justification for war with the disbelievers of Makkah.
  - After the migration to Al-Madinah, when the first Hajj season approached, it naturally brought along with it anguish and anger both for the Muhajirs and the Ansar, who had been debarred froth visiting Makkah and performing Hajj, That is why, in this passage (verse 26-37), the rituals and the objects of Hajj have been described to bring home to the disbelievers that they had no right to debar anyone from Hajj.
  - On the other hand, the Muslims are being prepared to fight not with the intention of wreaking vengeance but for the sake of reform. At the same time sacrifice on the occasion of Hajj has been prescribed as a permanent rite to enable them (and the Muslims of the whole world) to commemorate Hajj and the rites connected with it, so that they might refrain from wreaking vengeance on the people of Makkah for the persecution to which they had been subjected.
  - They have, therefore, been enjoined to fight to bring about better conditions and not to take revenge on their persecutors.
