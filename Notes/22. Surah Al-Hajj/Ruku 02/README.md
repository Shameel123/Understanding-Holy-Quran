**Ayat  11 - 22**

## Ayat 11

- `And among people is he who worships Allah on the borderline;`
- `if any good befalls him, he is satisfied;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This type of man is a time server, who stands on the boundary line between Islam and kufr so that he may join the winning side whether it be Islam or kufr.
- `but if a trial afflicts him, he utterly turns away.2`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - As this type of man has a weak character and wavers between kufr and Islam he becomes the slave of his self.
    - He accepts Islam for the sake of self interest. He is faithful to it if all his wishes are fulfilled and he has a life of ease and comfort, he is well-pleased with his Allah and is firm in his faith. 
    - On the contrary, if his faith demands some sacrifice from him, or he is visited by some affliction, or encounters some hardship and loss in the way of Allah, or he does not have his way, he begins to waver about the Godhead of Allah and the Prophethood of the Messenger and becomes skeptical about everything of the faith.
    - Then he is ready to bow down before any power from which he expects some benefit and security from loss.
- `He will incur the loss of this world and the Hereafter.`
- `That indeed is a clear loss.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is a great moral proposition that has been stated concisely. The fact is that the wavering man remains a loser in this world as well as in the next world, and fares worse even than an unbeliever. 
    - The unbeliever applies himself exclusively to the benefits of this world and becomes more or less successful in his object because he is not handicapped by the fear of Allah, accountability of the Hereafter and restrictions of divine law.
    - Likewise, a true believer follows the way of Allah with fortitude and perseverance and may as well become successful in this world, but even if he loses it altogether, he is assured of success in the next world.
    - But the wavering Muslim becomes a loser both in this world and in the next world because he is handicapped by doubt and indecision and cannot make his choice between the two worlds. As he cannot decide whether there is Allah and the Hereafter, he cannot apply himself exclusively to the worldly affairs with that single-mindedness which the unbeliever enjoys. And when he thinks of Allah and the Hereafter, the allurements of this world and the fear of the disadvantages here and the abhorrence of observing the divine restrictions do not let him apply himself exclusively to the demands of the Hereafter. This conflict between God worship and world worship makes him a loser in this world as well as in the next.


## Ayat 12

- `He invokes, instead of Allah, those who can neither harm nor benefit him.`
- `That indeed is straying far away.`

## Ayat 13

- `He invokes those that are more likely to cause him harm than benefit.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - (Verses 12-13) clarify two things about the deities whom the mushriks invoke.
    - Firstly, they can do a person neither any good nor any harm.
      - Nay, it is more probable that they do harm rather than good.
      - For when the mushrik invokes other deities than Allah, he loses his faith forthwith.
    - Secondly, the mushrik himself knows that there is no guarantee or probability of any good from his god who is utterly helpless and powerless. As regards to the occasional grant of his request through his god, this is done by Allah merely to test his faith.
- `Such is surely an evil patron, and an evil associate.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the one, who leads a person to the way of shirk is the worst guardian and the worst comrade, whether he be a human being or a satan.

## Ayat 14

- `(In contrast) Allah will assuredly cause those who believe and act righteously to enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **“Those who believed and did righteous deeds”** are quite different from the wavering Muslims, for they have a firm belief in Allah, His Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Hereafter.
    - Therefore they follow the way of truth both in prosperity and in adversity.
- `For, most certainly, Allah does whatever He pleases.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Allah's powers are unlimited. He may bestow anything on anyone He wills in this world or in the Hereafter or in both, and bar anything from anyone. None has the power to interfere with what He wills and does.

## Ayat 15

- `Anyone who fancies that Allah will not support him in this world and in the Hereafter, let him reach out to heaven through a rope, and then make a hole in the sky and see whether his device can avert that which enrages him.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There is a great divergence of opinion about the exact meaning of this verse. Some of the interpretations are

## Ayat 16

- `Even so We have revealed the Qur'an with Clear Signs.`
- `Verily Allah guides whomsoever He wills.`

## Ayat 17

- `On the Day of Resurrection`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This means the Muslims of every age who believed in the Prophets of Allah and His Books up to the time of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him): they included both the sincere Muslims and the wavering Muslims. 
- `Allah will most certainly judge among those who believe,`
- `and those who became Jews,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - See(E.N. 72 of Surah An-Nisa). 
- `and Sabaeans,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Sabaeans: In ancient times two sects were known by this title: 
      1. The followers of Prophet John, who were found in upper Iraq in large numbers and practiced baptism.
      2. The worshipers of stars, who ascribed their creed to Prophets Shith and Idris (peace be upon them) and believed that the elements were governed by the planets and the planets by the angels. Their center was at Harran with branches spread all over Iraq. These people have been well known for their knowledge of philosophy and science and their achievements in medicine. Probably here the first sect is referred to, because the second sect was not known by this name at the time the Quran was revealed.
- `and Christians,`
- `and Magians,`
- `and those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the fire worshipers of Iran, who believed in two gods, one of light and the other of darknesses, and regarded themselves as the followers of Zoroaster.
    - Their creed and morals were so corrupted by Mazdak that a brother could easily enter into matrimony with his sister. 
- `Surely Allah watches over everything.`

## Ayat 18

### **SAJDAH AYAH**

- **`Have you not seen that all those who are in the heavens and all those who are in the earth prostrate themselves before Allah;`**
- `and so do the sun and the moon, and the stars and the mountains, and the trees, and the beasts, and so do many human beings,`
- `and even many of those who are condemned to chastisement?`
- **`And he whom Allah humiliates, none can give him honour.`**
- **`Allah does whatever He wills.`**

## Ayat 19

- `These two groups (the believers and unbelievers) are in dispute about their Lord.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here all the disputants about Allah have been divided into two main categories in spite of their large numbers.
- `As for those that disbelieve,`
- **`garments of fire have been cut out for them;`**
- **`boiling water shall be poured down over their heads,`**

## Ayat 20

- **`causing (not only) their skins but all that is in their bellies as well to melt away.`**

## Ayat 21

- **`There shall be maces of iron to lash them.`**

## Ayat 22

- `Whenever they try, in their anguish, to escape from Hell, they will be driven back into it, (and shall be told):`
  - **`"Now taste the torment of burning."`**
