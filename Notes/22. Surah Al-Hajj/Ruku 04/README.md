**Ayat  26 - 33**

## Ayat 26

- `Call to mind when We assigned to Abraham the site of the House (Kabah), directing him:`
  - `"Do not associate aught with Me"`
- `and`
  - `"Keep My House pure for those who walk around it,`
  - `and for those who stand`
  - `and who bow down`
  - `and who prostrate themselves (in worship),`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Some commentators opine that the address to Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) ends with (verse 26) and say that the command contained in(verse 27) was addressed to the Prophet (peace be upon him); but this opinion does not fit in with the context.
  - For it is obvious that this command was also addressed to Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) when he had built the Kabah.
  - Moreover, the command implies that the House of Allah had been built for the worship of One Allah and there was general permission from the very first day for all worshipers to visit it for performing Hajj.


## Ayat 27

- `and publicly proclaim Pilgrimage for all mankind`
- `so that they come to you on foot and mounted on lean camels from every distant point`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The expression lean camels has been deliberately used to depict the picture of the camels of pilgrims coming from far off places to perform Hajj.

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In my opinion the address to Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) comes to an end with (verse 27, and verses 28- 29) have been added to emphasize and give further instructions for the performance of Hajj. 
  - We have based this opinion on the use of the epithet Ancient House of the Kabah. It could not have been used at the time when Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) built it. 
  - For further details about the construction of the Kabah see (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayats 125-129); (Surah Aal-Imran, Ayats, 96-97); and(Surah Ibrahim, Ayats 35-41).


## Ayat 28

- `to witness the benefits in store for them,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “The benefits” include both religious and worldly benefits.
    - It was due mainly to the Kabah that during the period of 2500 years between the times of Prophet Abraham and the Prophet (peace be upon them), the Arabs, in spite of their tribal life, remained attached to one central place and continued to visit it from all parts of Arabia for performing Hajj year after year.
    - This in turn preserved their language, their culture and their Arab identity. Then during the course of the year they were afforded at least four months of perfect peace when anybody and everybody could safely travel alone or in trade caravans; thus the ritual of Hajj was directly beneficial to economic life of the country as well.
    - For details see(Surah Aal-Imran, Ayat 97 and E.Ns 80, 81) thereof, and (Surah Al-Maidah, Ayat 97 and E.N. 113 )thereof.
- `and pronounce the name of Allah during the appointed days over the cattle that He has provided them.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “The cattle” here imply the camel, cow, sheep and goat as has been clearly mentioned in (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayats 142-144),
    - **“they should mention the name of Allah over the cattle”**, implies that they should slaughter the cattle for Allah’s sake and in His name, as is clear from the subsequent sentences.
    - Allah’s name should be recited at the time the cattle are slaughtered to show that the Muslims are to slaughter and sacrifice animals in Allah’s name alone so as to distinguish them from the disbelievers who slaughtered animals without mentioning Allah’s name or by mentioning other names than that of Allah.
- `So eat of it and feed the distressed and the needy.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - As regards to “the appointed days”, there is a difference of opinion as to their exact identity. Some of the opinions as to what the appointed days mean are.

## Ayat 29

- `Thereafter,`
- `let them tidy up`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It means that after performing the essential Hajj rites, one should put off Ihram, have a shave, bath, etc. for one is free from the restrictions of Ihram after Hajj.
    - However, one is not allowed to have sexual relations with his wife till one has performed the Tawaf of Ziyarah or Ifadah.
- `and fulfil their vows`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the vow one has made for that occasion.
- `and circumambulate the Ancient House."`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Arabic word Atiq, which has been used for the Kabah, is very meaningful for it implies.

## Ayat 30

- `Such (was the purpose of building the Kabah).`
- `Whosoever, then, venerates Allah's sanctities will find it to be good for him in the sight of his Lord.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Though the command is of a general nature, here it refers particularly to the prohibitions which are connected with the Sacred Mosque, Hajj, Umrah and Makkah.
    - Incidentally, there is a subtle hint in it to the Quraish; who had driven out the Muslims from Makkah and debarred them from Hajj and violated the sanctity of the Ancient House by associating indecent, filthy, and ungodly rites with Hajj and the House in contradiction to the ways of Abraham.
- `Cattle have been made lawful for you`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “And the cattle have been made lawful for you” has been cited here for two objects.
      1. It is to refute the custom of the Quraish under which certain cattle, bahirah. saibah, wasilah and ham, were considered unlawful. They are being told that these are also lawful like other cattle.
      2. It is not unlawful as was held by the Quraish to eat the flesh of the cattle even in the state of Ihram.
- `except those mentioned to you (as unlawful).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This refers to (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayat 145) and (Surah An-Nahal, Ayat 115) in which Allah has forbidden the Muslims to eat what dies of itself, blood, flesh of swine or what has been slaughtered in any name other than Allah’s.
- `So shun the abomination of idols`
- `and shun all words of falsehood.`

## Ayat 31

- `Become exclusively devoted to Allah, ascribing Divinity to none other than Him.`
- `Whoso ascribes Divinity to aught beside Allah, it is as though he fell down from the sky whereafter either the birds will snatch him away, or the wind will sweep him to a distant place (causing him to be shattered to pieces).`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In this parable heaven means the original human nature.
  - Man by nature is the servant of none else but Allah and inherently accepts the doctrine of Tauhid. That is why the one who follows the guidance of the Prophets becomes firm in these dictates of his nature and soars higher and higher.
  - On the other hand, the one who rejects Allah or associates a partner with Him falls down from the heaven of his nature.
  - Then he either becomes a victim of satans and evil leaders like the birds of the parable, which snatch away the fallen man, or he becomes a slave of his lusts, passions, whims, etc., which have been likened to the wind in the parable.
  - They lower him down from one wrong position to the other till he falls into the deepest abyss of degradation.

## Ayat 32

- `Such is the fact.`
- `And whoso venerates the sanctity of all that have been ordained as symbols1 of Allah`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:   
    - “Symbols of Allah”: the performance of Salat, Hajj, Fasting, etc., or things like a Mosque or sacrificial offerings, etc.
    - See (Surah Al-Maidah, Ayat 2 and E.Ns 5-7) thereof.
- `surely does so because it is part of the true piety of the hearts.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:   
    - That is, the observance of the sanctity of the symbols by a man is a proof that there is piety in his heart.
    - On the other hand, the man who violates their sanctity proves himself to be void of piety and fear of God. It shows that he either does not believe at all in Allah or adopts a rebellious attitude against Him.

## Ayat 33

- `You may derive benefit (from sacrificial animals) until an appointed time.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is to remove the misunderstanding about getting any benefit from the animals dedicated for sacrifice as they were also included in the symbols of Allah.
    - This was necessitated because the Arabs believed that it was unlawful to get any benefit from them.
    - One could neither ride on them nor carry any load on them nor consume their milk, after they had been dedicated for sacrifice during Hajj.
    - In this verse that misunderstanding has been removed.
    - Abu Hurairah and Anas have reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) saw a man walking in a miserable condition on foot leading his camel by the nosestring. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) asked him to ride on it, he replied that it was his sacrificial offering. The Prophet (peace be upon him) again urged him to ride on his camel.
- `Thereafter their place (of sacrifice) is near the Ancient House.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There is a divergence of opinion in regard to the interpretation “of an appointed term”. Some commentators, particularly Ibn Abbas, Qatadah, Mujahid, Dahhak and Ata are of the view that it refers to the time of the dedication of the animals for sacrifice.
  - Obviously this is not the correct view, because in that case the permission to get benefit from them becomes meaningless.
  - There are other commentators including Urwah bin Zubair and Ala bin Abi Rabah, who are of the view that “appointed term” means the time of sacrifice and one can get benefit from them up till then. One may ride on them, drink their milk, take their young ones for use and shear their hair, wool, etc. Imam Shafai has adopted this view. The Hanafites are of the opinion that one can get benefit from them, if need be, though it is preferable not to do so.
