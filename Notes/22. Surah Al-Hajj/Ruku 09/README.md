**Ayat  65 - 72**

## Ayat 65

- `Have you not seen how Allah has subjected to you`
- `all that is in the earth,`
- `and the vessels that sail in the sea by His command,1`
- `and it is He Who holds back the sky that it may not fall on earth except by His leave?`
- **`Surely Allah is Most Gentle, Ever Compassionate to people.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here “the heaven” implies the whole of the universe above and below the earth where everything is held in its own place and sphere.

## Ayat 66

- `And it is He Who has endowed you with life`
- `and it is He who causes you to die,`
- `and it is He Who will then resurrect you.`
- `Man is indeed extremely prone to denying the Truth.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, though man sees every reality presented by the Prophets, yet he denies it.

## Ayat 67

 - `For every people`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, the community of every Prophet.
 - `We have prescribed a way of worship`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Here the Arabic word mansak has been used in its most comprehensive sense which also includes sacrifice (verse 34).
      - It means service, worship, in short, the entire way of life. 
      - The same theme has been expressed in (Surah Al-Maidah, Ayat 48): We prescribed a law and a way of life for each of you.
 - `which they follow.`
 - `So, (O Muhammad), let them not dispute with you concerning this,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, now you have brought a way of life just as the former Prophets brought ways of life for their people.
      - Therefore the people have no right to dispute with you concerning the law you have brought.
 - `and call them to Your Lord.`
 - `You are certainly on the Straight Way.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This confirms the explanation given in( E.N. 117) above.

## Ayat 68

- `And if they dispute with you,`
- `say:`
  - **`"Allah knows well what you do.`**


## Ayat 69

- `Allah will judge among you on the Day of Resurrection concerning matters about which you disagreed."`

## Ayat 70

- `Are you not aware that Allah knows all that is in the heaven and the earth?`
- `Surely it is all preserved in a Book.`
- `Indeed that is easy with Allah.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In order to understand the significance of this paragraph, we should keep in view (verse 55- 57) with which this is connected.

## Ayat 71

- `Instead of Allah they worship those`
- `concerning whom He has revealed no sanction and`
- `concerning whom they have no true knowledge.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, neither there is any mention of their deities in any revealed Book nor do they have any other source of knowledge about them nor any authority to worship them.
      - Therefore, it is sheer ignorance that they have associated their self invented deities with Allah and worship them, make vows and offer sacrifices to them and supplicate them for their needs etc.
- `None shall be able to help such evil-doers.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This is to warn the foolish people that they are absolutely wrong in expecting that their deities would help them in this world and in the Hereafter because they have no power to help them.
      - Thus, they will find no helper, for Allah alone could help them and they have already displeased Him by their rebellious behavior.


## Ayat 72

- `When Our Signs are plainly recited to them,`
- `you will perceive utter repugnance on their faces`
- `and it all but seems as if they will soon pounce upon those who recite Our Signs to them.`
- `Say:`
  - **`"Shall I tell you what is worse than that? The Fire with which Allah has threatened those who disbelieve. That is truly an evil end."`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, you will meet with a far worse state of anguish than that which you display against those who recite divine revelations to you.
