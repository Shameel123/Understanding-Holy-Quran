**Ayat  01 - 10**

## Ayat 1

- `O mankind, fear the (wrath of) your Lord!`
- `Indeed, the earthquake of the Hour (of Judgement) will be an awesome thing.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - According to the early commentators, this earthquake will be a prelude to Resurrection.
  - This will probably take place when the earth will begin to rotate in the reverse order, and the sun will rise in the west.
  - **In a lengthy tradition reported by Ibn Jarir, Tabarani and Ibn Abi Hatim from Abu Hurairah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) has stated that when the first Trumpet will be blown, there will be a general confusion. At the second all people will die and at the third they will be brought back to life and presented before Allah. At the first blowing of the Trumpet, the earth will begin to rock like a boat which is beaten about by huge waves, or like a hanging lamp which is moved from side to side by a strong wind.**

## Ayat 2

- `On the Day when you witness it, the suckling woman shall utterly neglect the infant she suckles,`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is to show the intensity and horror of the earthquake. At that time there will be so much confusion and terror that mothers will forsake their dear children at the very time they will be suckling them.
- `and every pregnant woman shall cast her burden, and you will see people as though they are drunk, when they are not drunk;`
- `but dreadful shall be Allah's chastisement.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It should be noted that it is not meant to depict here the condition of the Resurrection but to impress upon the people the dreadful torment of the Hour in order to admonish them to mend their ways. This is supported by the subsequent passage.

## Ayat 3

- `Among people there are some who wrangle about Allah without knowledge and follow every rebellious devil,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - They do not indulge in discussions or disputes about the being or existence of Allah but about His rights and powers and His Revelations, as is evident from the succeeding passage.
  - When the Prophet (peace be upon him) tried to convince them of Tauhid and Resurrection, inevitably the dispute arose whether there is One Allah, the sole Sovereign or there were other partners as well in His Godhead and whether He has the power to bring about Resurrection, etc.

## Ayat 4

- **`although it is decreed about him that he shall lead into error whosoever takes him for a friend, and will direct him to the torment of the Fire.`**

## Ayat 5

- `O mankind!`
- `If you have any doubt concerning Resurrection,`
- `then know that it is surely We Who created you from dust,`
- `then from a drop of sperm,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **“We have created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm”**: 
      - The first man Adam was created directly from clay and after him the process of procreation started by means of sperm-drop.
      - This has been stated in Surah AsSajda, Ayats 7-8 as well.
      - It may also mean that man is created from sperm-drop but his body is made of those elements which are all available in the earth.
- `then from a clot of blood,`
- `then from a little lump of flesh,`
- `some of it shapely and other shapeless.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This refers to the different stages of development of the child in the womb of its mother. This description is based on observation and not on scientific research, and there was no need for it for the purpose for which reference to this has been made here.
- `(We are rehearsing this)`
- `that We may make the reality clear to you.`
- `We cause (the drop of sperm) that We please to remain in the wombs till an appointed time.`
- `We bring you forth as infants (and nurture you) that you may come of age.`
- `Among you is he that dies (at a young age) and he who is kept back to the most abject age so that after once having known, he reaches a stage when he knows nothing.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, in old age man is again reverted to the same condition in which he was in childhood.
    - He loses his senses and knows little or nothing like a child.
- `You see the earth dry and barren and then no sooner than We send down water upon it, it begins to quiver and swell and brings forth every kind of beauteous vegetation.`

## Ayat 6

- `All this is because Allah, He is the Truth,`
- `and because He resurrects the dead,`
- `and because He has power over everything,`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Arabic text may mean three things:
      1. Allah is telling the truth and you are wrong in presuming that there is no possibility of life-after-death.
      2. Allah’s existence is not merely a supposition but it is a reality. He is not only the first cause but has supreme authority, and is conducting every affair in the universe according to His Will, Knowledge and Wisdom.
      3. All His designs and works are based on truth and are, therefore, serious, meaningful and full of wisdom.

## Ayat 7

- `(all of which shows that) the Hour shall surely come to pass`
- `- in this there is no doubt - `
- `nd Allah shall surely resurrect those that are in graves.`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In(Ayats 5-7), the effects of rain on the earth and the growth of vegetation and different stages of the life of man have been cited as pointers to five realities.


## Ayat 8

- `And among people are those that wrangle about Allah`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, they are so proud, arrogant, obdurate and obstinate that they do not pay any heed to admonition.
- `without knowledge,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Knowledge: That personal information which is gained directly through observation and experience.
- `without any true guidance,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Guidance: That information which is gained by reasoning or through another person who has knowledge.
- `and without any scripture to enlighten them.4`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Book with light: Source of information gained from divine revelation.

## Ayat 9

- `They wrangle arrogantly, intent on leading people astray from the Way of Allah.1`
- `Such shall suffer disgrace in this world and We shall cause them to taste the chastisement of burning (in the Next).`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Verse 3 mentioned those people who have themselves gone astray, but verse 9 mentions those who have not only deviated from the right way themselves but are also bent upon misleading others from it.

## Ayat 10

- `That is the outcome of what your own hands have wrought,`
- `for Allah never wrongs His creatures.`
