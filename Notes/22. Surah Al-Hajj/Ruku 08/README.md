**Ayat  58 - 64**

## Ayat 58

- `As for those who migrated in the way of Allah,`
- `whereafter they were slain, or died,`
- `Allah will certainly grant them a goodly provision.`
- `Indeed, Allah is the Best of all those who provide.`

## Ayat 59

- `He will surely admit them to a resort which will please them.`
- `Most certainly Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - As Allah is All-Knowing, He knows well those who left their homes for His sake and what reward they deserve.
  - He is Clement, and forgives minor errors and weaknesses of the people; therefore these things will not hinder Him from rewarding the believers for their services and sacrifices.

## Ayat 60

- `That indeed is so, as for him who retaliates in proportion to the excess committed against him, and is thereafter again subjected to transgression, Allah will surely aid him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The preceding verses referred to those persecuted people who could not retaliate and here the reference is to those victims of persecution who could fight back.
- `Verily Allah is All-Pardoning, All-Forgiving.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - From this verse, Imam Shafai has concluded that retaliation will be effected in the way as life was taken in the original act.
      - If a person is killed by immersion in water, the killer also should be put to death by immersion in water; or if a person is burnt to death, the killer also will be burnt to death.
    - The Hanafites dispute this. According to them, retaliation against a murderer will be incurred in one and the same established way no matter how life was taken by the culprit in the original act.

## Ayat 61

- `So shall it be`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “That is” (as stated in the preceding paragraph) because Allah is the Ruler of the universe and has the power to give punishments and rewards to those who deserve them.
- `because it is Allah Who causes the night to emerge out of the day`
- `and causes the day to emerge out of the night`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The fact that “Allah causes.........night” is a proof that He is the Master, Sovereign and Ruler of the universe.
    - But the deeper meaning of the verse is that Allah, Who is able to bring forth the light of the day out of the darkness of the night, has the power to bring out the light of the truth out of the darkness of disbelief and ignorance, and the light of justice out of the darkness of tyranny.
- **`and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - He hears everything and sees everything and is not unaware of anything.

## Ayat 61

- `So shall it be`
- `because Allah, He is the Truth,`
- `and all whom they invoke instead of Him are false.1`
- **`Allah is Most High, All-Great.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - As Allah is in fact the Sovereign of the universe, His worshipers will surely attain true success and the worshipers of false gods will meet with utter failure.

## Ayat 62

- `Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the sky whereby the earth turns green?1`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This verse has a deeper meaning also, though apparently it merely declares that Allah alone has the power to send down rain which makes the land green.
    - The deeper meaning is that the rainfall of the blessed revelation will, in the near future, turn the barren land of Arabia into a garden of knowledge, morality and bring forth a high and righteous civilization. 
- **`Verily Allah is Subtle, All-Aware.`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Latif implies that Allah fulfills His designs in such fine ways that it is difficult to understand them till they become real and apparent.

## Ayat 63

- **`To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth.`**
- **`Surely Allah - He alone is Self- Sufficient, Praiseworthy.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - He alone is All-Sufficient and is not in need of anyone in any way. He is All-praiseworthy because all praise belongs to Him alone whether anyone praises Him or not.
