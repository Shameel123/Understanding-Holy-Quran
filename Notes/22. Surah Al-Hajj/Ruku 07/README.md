**Ayat  49 - 57**

## Ayat 49

- `Say (O Muhammad):`
  - `"O people! I have been sent to you only as a plain warner`
    - `(before the Doom strikes you)."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, I am merely a warner and not the maker of your destinies. It is Allah Who passes judgment and decides about the punishment.


## Ayat 50

- `So those who believe and act righteously shall be granted forgiveness and an honourable sustenance,`

- Tafhim-ul-Quran:
  - The believers shall have forgiveness’ means that Allah will overlook their faults, weaknesses, and acts of omission and commission.
  - They will have honorable provisions means that they will have excellent supplies which will be given to them in an honorable way.
## Ayat 51

- `whereas those who strive against Our Signs,`
- `seeking to profane them,`
- `they are the friends of the Fire!`

## Ayat 52


- `Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet1 before you (O Muhammad),`
- `but that whenever he had a desire,`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Arabic word tamanna has two meanings: “desire” and “to recite” something.
- `Satan interfered with that desire.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - If the first meaning is taken, it will imply: Satan tried to prevent the fulfillment of his desire.
    - If the second meaning is taken, it will imply: When the Prophet recited the Revelations, Satan created different sorts of doubts about its truth and meanings in the minds of the people.
- `Allah eradicates the interference of Satan and strengthens His Signs.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - If the first meaning is adopted, it will imply: Allah fulfills the Prophet’s desire and makes his mission successful in spite of the obstacles of Satan and confirms the truth of His revelations by fulfilling His promises to the Prophet.
    - In case of the second meaning, it will imply: Allah eradicates all the doubts and objections inspired by Satan in the hearts of the people and clarifies the confusion created about any verse of the Quran in subsequent revelations.
- `Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Allah is All-Knower” and has full knowledge of the mischief worked by Satan and of its effects, and being All- Wise, He counteracts every mischief of Satan.
    - For the distinction between Nabi and Rasul, refer to (E. N. 30 of Surah Maryam).


## Ayat 53

- `(He does this) in order that He may make the evil caused by Satan a trial for those in whose hearts there is sickness (of hypocrisy), whose hearts are hard (and vitiated).`
- `Surely these wrong-doers have gone too far in their dissension.`

## Ayat 54

- `(He also does this) in order that those endowed with knowledge may know that it is the Truth from your Lord and that they may have faith in it and their hearts may humble themselves before Him.`
- `Verily Allah always directs those that believe to the Right Way.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran
  - That is, Allah lets Satan work such mischief to put to the test both the righteous and the wicked people. The people with a perverted mentality deduce wrong conclusions from these and deviate from the right way, while those, who think on the right lines, realize that all these things are the mischief of Satan and that the message of the Prophet is based on the truth. They conclude that the very fact that Satan has been so much agitated and become active against it is a clear proof of its being the truth.
  - It is very important to understand the real significance of this passage (verses 52-54) for this has given rise to a grave misunderstanding.

## Ayat 55

- `The unbelievers will not cease to be in doubt about it until`
- `the Hour suddenly comes upon them, or the chastisement of an ominous day overtakes them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran
  - The epithet “barren” has been applied to the day in its metaphorical and not literal sense. :A day is barren if all the plans, hopes and devices remain unproductive in it, or it does not bring forth its night. For instance, the days on which the people of Prophet Noah, the tribes of Aad and Thamud, the people of Lot and of Midian met with their destruction by scourge from Allah, were barren days in this sense, because those days did not bring forth any tomorrow for them, and no device of theirs could avert their doom.

## Ayat 56

- `On that Day all sovereignty shall be Allah's and He will judge among them.`
- `Then those who believed and acted righteously shall be in Gardens of Bliss.`

## Ayat 57

- `A humiliating chastisement awaits those who disbelieved and denied Our Signs.`
