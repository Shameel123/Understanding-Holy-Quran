**Ayat  39 - 48**

## Ayat 39

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This (verse 39) is the first verse of the Quran in which permission to fight was given in the month of Zil-Hajj in the first year after Hijrah according to our research.
  - Then the command to fight was given in (verse 190, 191, 193, 216 and 244 of Surah Al-Baqarah) in Rajab or Shaban of A.H. 2.

- `Permission (to fight) has been granted to those for they have been wronged.`
- **`Verily Allah has the power to help them:`**
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - **“Allah surely has Power over giving them victory”**:
    - this assurance was urgently needed by the persecuted Muslims whose fighting strength at that time was very meager, not even a thousand including all the migrants and the Muslims of Al-Madinah. 
    - On the other hand, the fighting strength of the Quraish by themselves was much greater. Besides, they had all the other mushrik clans of Arabia at their back and were joined later by the Jews as well. Therefore, this assurance was most opportune and the challenge to the disbelievers was very significant, for it meant to say that they were not fighting against a small number of the Muslims but against Allah. Therefore, **“You are welcome to fight if you dare”**.

## Ayat 40

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The mention of their expulsion from their homes in (verse 40) is a clear proof that this portion of Surah Al-Hajj was revealed at Al-Madinah.

- `those who were unjustly expelled from their homes`
- `for no other reason than their saying: `**`"Allah is Our Lord."`**
- `If Allah were not to repel some through others, monasteries and churches and synagogues and mosques wherein the name of Allah is much mentioned, would certainly have been pulled down.`
- `Allah will most certainly help those who will help Him.`
- `Verily Allah is Immensely Strong, Overwhelmingly Mighty.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In order to have an idea of the severe persecution of the Muslims, a few instances of this are cited.
      1. Suhaib Rumi was deprived of everything, when he was about to migrate to Al-Madinah. When he reached there, he had nothing with him except the clothes he was wearing. Though he had earned all that through his own labors, he was deprived of everything by the disbelievers of Makkah.
      2. When Abu Salmah was about to leave Makkah with his wife and a suckling child, his in laws forcibly separated his wife from him, and then the people of his own family took away the child from them. Thus the poor woman had to pass one whole year in sorrow and grief. After a year, she secured the child somehow and journeyed from Makkah to Al-Madinah with it all alone on a dangerous route.

## Ayat 41

- `(Allah will certainly help) those`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Those who help Allah are the people who invite mankind to Tauhid and exert their utmost to establish the true faith and righteousness.
      - For further explanation see (E.N. 50 of Surah Aal-Imran).
- `who, were We to bestow authority on them in the land,`
- `will establish Prayers, render Zakah, enjoin good, and forbid evil.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “If We give them authority”: In this one sentence, the real aim of the Islamic State and the characteristics of those who conduct its affairs have been stated concisely but comprehensively.
    - Those who help Allah and deserve His succor behave righteously, establish Salat, make arrangements for the collection of Zakat and use their power and authority to propagate good and eradicate evil.
- `The end of all matters rests with Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it is Allah Who decides whom to give power in the land and when.
    - This is meant to remove the misunderstanding of the proud and arrogant people who think that the destiny of the land and its dwellers is in their hands, and there is none to depose them from power.
    - But Allah dethrones the most haughty ruler in supernatural ways and gives power to the most humble in order to show that He is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.

## Ayat 42


- `(O Prophet), if they give the lie to you,`
- `then before them the people of 'Ad and Thamud, also gave the lie (to the Prophets),`

- In Arabic Ayah, "Qoum-e-Nooh" is also mentioned

## Ayat 43

- `and so too did the people of Abraham and the people of Lot;`

## Ayat 44

- `and so did the dwellers of Midian,`
- `and Moses too was branded a liar.`
- `Initially I granted respite to the unbelievers for a while and then seized them.`
- `How dreadful was My punishment!`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The instances of some peoples who rejected their Prophets have been cited to impress that they were given respite to reform themselves before they were punished.
    - Therefore: O people of Makkah, you should not be deluded by the delay in your punishment. When the term of respite comes to an end, you shall also be punished like the former people, if you do not mend your ways in the meantime.
 

## Ayat 45

- `How many towns have We destroyed because their people were steeped in iniquity:1`
- `so they lie fallen down upon their turrets!`
- `How many wells lie deserted;`
- `and how many towering palaces lie in ruins!`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In Arabic a well is synonymous with a habitation.
    - Thus “many a wells” means “many a habitation has been destroyed”.

## Ayat 46

- `Have they not journeyed in the land that their hearts might understand and their ears might listen?`
- `For indeed it is not the eyes that are blinded;`
- `it is rather the hearts in the breasts that are rendered blind.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The words “blinded are the hearts” have been used in the metaphorical and not in the literal sense.
  - Since the heart is regarded as the center of emotions, feelings and of mental and moral qualities, these words have been used to imply that their obduracy has inhibited them from feeling and acting rationally.

## Ayat 47

- `They ask you to hasten the punishment.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This refers to the oft-repeated challenge by the disbelievers: Well, if you are a true prophet, why does not that chastisement come with which you have been threatening us, for we have been rejecting your claim of being a true Prophet of Allah.
- **`Allah shall most certainly not fail His promise;`**
- **`but a Day with your Lord is as a thousand years of your reckoning.`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the decisions of Allah do not follow your time and calendar, nor do the consequences of your wrong attitudes appear immediately after the deeds. Therefore it will be very foolish for the part of a people to argue that the threat of punishment was empty just because a decade or a century had passed since they had adopted a wicked attitude and conduct with impurity.

## Ayat 48

- `How many towns did I respite at first though they were steeped in iniquity,`
- `and then I seized them!`
- `To Me are all destined to return.`
