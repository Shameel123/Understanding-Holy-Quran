**Ayat  23 - 25**

## Ayat 23

- `(On the other hand), Allah will cause those who believed and acted righteously to enter the Gardens beneath which rivers flow.`
- `They shall be decked in them with bracelets of gold and pearls and their raiment shall be of silk.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is to show that they will be honored like the kings and chiefs who used to wear ornaments of gold and jewelry in the period the Quran was revealed.

## Ayat 24

- `They were guided (to accept) the pure word;`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - **“Purest of the speeches”**: though it may imply every pure thing, here it refers to the basic articles of the faith.
- `they were guided to the Way of the Praiseworthy (Lord).`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - As already stated in the introduction, the portion of the Surah, which was revealed at Makkah, comes to an end here.
  - Though its style is clearly that of the Makki Surahs and there is nothing to indicate that any part (or the whole) of it was revealed at Al-Madinah, yet the words, **“these are the two parties”**, have given rise to the misunderstanding that this verse was revealed at Al-Madinah.
  - Some commentators are of the opinion that the two parties referred to were the parties who met in the Battle of Badr, but there is nothing in the context to support this opinion.
  - On the other hand, from the context in which these words occur, it becomes obvious that the two parties referred to were the believers and the disbelievers.
  - For the conflict between belief and disbelief has always been going on ever since the creation of man and will go on upto the Day of Resurrection.


## Ayat 25

- `Indeed those who disbelieve`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Those who disbelieved” were the people who rejected the message of the Prophet (peace be upon him).
    - The subsequent theme clearly shows that they were the disbelievers of Makkah.
- `and who (now) hinder people from the Way of Allah and hinder them from the Holy Mosque`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they debarred the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his followers from performing Hajj and Umrah.
- `which We have set up (as a place of worship) for all people,`
- `equally for those who dwell therein and for those who come from outside,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, this is not exclusively the property of any person or family or clan but is meant for all mankind alike.
    - Therefore none has any right to debar others from it.
- `(they surely deserve punishment).`
- `Whosoever deviates therein from the Right Way and acts with iniquity,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this connection, two questions have arisen among the Jurists of Islam:
- `We shall cause him to taste a painful chastisement.`
