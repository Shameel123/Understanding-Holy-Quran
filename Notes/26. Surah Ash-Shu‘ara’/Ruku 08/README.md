**Ayat 141 - 159**

## Ayat 141

- `The Thamud gave the lie to the Messengers.`

- Tafhim-ul-Quran:
  - For comparison, see (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 73-79); (Surah Hud, Ayats 61-68); (Surah Al-Hijr, Ayats 80-84);(Surah Bani Israil, Ayat 59); and for further details, see (Surah An-Naml, Ayats 45-53); (Surah Az-Zariyat, Ayats 43- 45); (Surah Al-Qamar, Ayats 23-31); (Surah AI-Haqqah, Ayats 4-5); (Surah Al-Fajr, Ayat 9); and (Surah Ash-Shams, Ayat 11).

## Ayat 142

- `Recall when their brother Salih said to them:`
  - `"Have you no fear?"`
## Ayat 143

- `"I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - According to the Quran, the people of Prophet Salih (peace be upon him) themselves admitted that he was a man of great integrity and extraordinary caliber:
  -  **They said, O Salih, till now you were such a person among us of whom we had great expectations.** 
     -  (Surah Houd, Ayat 62).


## Ayat 144

- `So fear Allah and obey me.`

## Ayat 145

- `I ask of you no reward.`
- `My reward is with none but the Lord of the Universe.`

## Ayat 146

- `Do you believe that you will be left here to live securely in the present state`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, do you consider that your life of indulgence and pleasure is everlasting, and you will never be asked to account for Allah’s favors to you and for your own misdeeds?

## Ayat 147

- `amidst gardens and springs`

## Ayat 148

- `and cornfields and date-palms laden with juicy fruits?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Hadim: heavy bunches of ripe, juicy and soft date-palm fruit hanging from trees.

## Ayat 149

- `You hew dwellings in mountains and exult in that.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Just as the most prominent feature of the Aad civilization was that they built large edifices with high pillars, so the most prominent feature of the Thamud civilization for which they were known among the ancient peoples was that they carved out dwellings in the hills.
  - That is why in Surah Al-Fajr, the Aad have been referred to as (people) of the pillars, and the Thamud as those who hewed rocks in the valley.
  - These people also built castles on the plains, the purpose and object of which was nothing but display of wealth and power and architectural skill as there was no real necessity for them.
  - These are, in fact, the ways of the perverted people: the poor among them do not have proper shelters, and the wealthy members not only have sufficient fine dwellings but over and above those they raise monuments for ostentation and display.

## Ayat 150

- `Fear Allah and obey me`

## Ayat 151

- `and do not follow the biddings of those that go to excesses`


## Ayat 152

- `and spread mischief in the land rather than set things right."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, you should give up obedience to your chiefs, guides and rulers under whose leadership you are following an evil way of life. These people have transgressed all bounds of morality: they cannot bring about any reforms and they will corrupt every system of life that they adopt. The only way for you towards success and well-being is that you should inculcate fear of God, give up obedience to the misguided and obey me, because I am God’s Messenger. 
  - You are fully aware of my honesty and integrity. I have no personal interest and motive for undertaking the work of reform. This was in short the manifesto which Prophet Salih (peace be upon him) presented before his people. It not only contained the religious message but invitation to cultural, moral and political revolution as well.

## Ayat 153

- `They replied:`
  - `"You are nothing but one of those who are bewitched;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Enchanted person, mad and insane person who has lost reasoning power. According to the ancient conceptions, madness was either due to the influence of a jinn or magic. That is why a mad person was either called majnun (one under the influence of a jinn) or one enchanted by magic.

## Ayat 154 

- `you are no different from a mortal like us.`
- `So produce a sign if you are truthful."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, we cannot believe you to be a Messenger from God because you are just like us and we see no distinction in you. However, if you are true in your claim that God has appointed you as His Messenger, you should present such a clear miracle as should make us believe that you have really been sent by the Creator and Master of the universe.

## Ayat 155

- `Salih said:`
  - `"This is a she-camel.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - From the context it appears that it was not a common she-camel, but it was brought about in a supernatural manner because it was presented in response to the demand for a miracle.
      - Prophet Salih (peace be upon him) could not have produced before the people an ordinary she-camel as a proof of his Prophethood because that would not have satisfied them.
      - **At other places in the Quran it has been clearly referred to as a miracle.**
      - In Surahs Al-Aaraf and Houd it has been said: **Here is Allah’s she camel, a sign for you.** (Surahs Al-Aaraf, Ayat 73).
      - In Surah Bani Israil the same thing has been stated more emphatically: **And nothing has hindered Us from sending signs except that the former people refused to acknowledge them as such. (For example) We sent the she-camel as an open sign to Thamud but they treated her with cruelty; whereas We send signs only by way of warning.** (verse 59).
      - Moreover, the challenge given to the wicked people of Thamud, after presenting the she-camel before them, was such that it could only be given after presenting a miracle.
  - `There is a day set for her to drink and there is a day set for you to drink.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, one day the she-camel will drink water all alone at your wells and springs, and one day you and your animals will take water, and this arrangement will not be violated in any way. 
      - There could hardly be a greater challenge for the people of Arabia, for taking of water had been the foremost cause of feuds and fights among them, which mostly resulted in bloodshed, even loss of life.
      - As such, the challenge given by Prophet Salih (peace be upon him) was indeed a challenge to the whole nation, which could not be acceptable unless the people were sure that the challenger had a great power at his back.
      - But Prophet Salih (peace be upon him) threw this challenge all by himself without any worldly power behind him, and the whole nation not only received it quietly, but also abided by it submissively for quite some days.

## Ayat 156

- `Do not molest her lest the chastisement of an Awesome Day should seize you."`

## Ayat 157

- `But they hamstrung her and then regretted it.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This does not mean that as soon as they heard the challenge, they attacked the she-camel at once and hamstrung her.
  - Actually, when the she-camel became a problem for the whole nation, the hearts of the people were filled with rage, and they began to hold lengthy consultations as to how to get rid of her.
  - At last, a haughty chief undertook the task of putting an end to her, as mentioned in Surah Ash-Shams thus: **When arose the most villainous of the people** (verse 12), and in Surah Al-Qamar thus: **They appealed to their companion; so he took up the responsibility and hamstrung her.** (verse 29).

## Ayat 158

- `So the chastisement seized them.`
- `Surely there is a Sign in this, but most of them would not believe.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - As stated at other places in the Quran, when the shecamel was killed, Prophet Salih (peace be upon him) declared: **You have only three more days to enjoy yourselves in your houses.** (Surah Houd, Ayat 65).
  - When this time limit came to an end, a shocking explosion took place in the night at about dawn, followed by a violent earthquake, which destroyed the whole nation completely. In the morning their dead bodies lay scattered here and there like dry pieces of bush trampled down by animals around an enclosure. 
  - Neither their stony castles nor their rock-hewn caves could protect them against the calamity.
  - **We sent against them a single blast and they became as the trampled twigs of the fence of a fold-builder.** (Surah Al- Qamar, Ayat 31). 
  - **Consequently a shocking catastrophe overtook them and they lay lifeless in their dwellings.** (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 78).
  - **At last a violent blast overtook them with the approach of the morning, and all that they had achieved proved of no avail to them.** (Surah Al-Hijr, Ayat 83, 84).

## Ayat 159

- `Verily Your Lord is Immensely Mighty, Most Compassionate.`
