**Ayat 69 - 104**

## Ayat 69


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This part of the life-history of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) relates to the time when after his appointment to Prophethood, a conflict had started between him and his people on the questions of shirk and Tauhid. In this connection, the reader should also see (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayats 258-260); (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayats 75-83); (Surah Maryam, Ayats 41-50);(Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 51-70); (Surah As-Saffat, Ayats 83-113); and(Surah Al- Mumtahanah, Ayats 4-5).

- `And recount to them the story of Abraham:`


## Ayat 70

- `when he asked his father and his people:`
  - `"What do you worship?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Obviously the object of this question was to remind the people that the deities which they worshiped were false and absolutely powerless.
  - In Surah Al Anbiya the same question has been posed thus: **What are these images to which you are so devoted.** (verse 52).

## Ayat 71

- `They answered:`
  - `"There are some idols that we worship and are devoted to them with constancy."`

## Ayat 72

- `He asked:`
  - `"Do they hear you when you call them`

## Ayat 73

- `or do they cause you any benefit or harm?"`

## Ayat 74

- `They answered:`
  - `"No; but we found our forefathers doing so."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, we do not worship and serve them because they hear our prayers and supplications, or that they can harm and benefit us, but because we have seen our elders worshiping and serving them. Thus, they themselves admitted that the only reason of their worshiping the idols was the blind imitation of their forefathers.
  - In other words, they meant this: There is nothing new in what you are telling us, We know that these are idols of stone and wood, which do not hear anything, nor can harm or do good, but we cannot believe that our elders who have been worshiping them since centuries, generation after generation, were foolish people. They must have had some good reason for worshiping these lifeless images, so we are doing the same as we have full faith in them.

## Ayat 75

- `Thereupon, Abraham said:`
  - `"Have you seen (with your eyes) those whom you have been worshipping,`

## Ayat 76

- `you and your forefathers of yore?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, is it enough to say that a religion is true only because it has been held as such by their ancestors? Should people, generation after generation, go on following their ancestors in their footsteps blindly without ever caring to see whether the deities they worship possess any divine attribute or not, and whether they have any power to influence their destinies?

## Ayat 77

- `They are all enemies to me;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, when I consider them, I see that if I worship them, I shall ruin myself both in this world and in the Hereafter. As their worship is clearly harmful, worshiping them is worshiping one’s enemy. These words of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) bear a close connection with (verses 81, 82 of Surah Maryam), which say: These people have set up gods other than Allah so that they may become their supporters. But they will have no supporter; all of them will not only disown their worship but also become their opponents (on the Day of Judgment).
- `all, except the Lord of the worlds,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It should be noted that Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) did not say: They are enemies to you, but said: They are enemies to me. In the first case, there was every chance that the people would have felt offended and provoked, because it would have been difficult for them to understand how their own gods could be their enemies. As a matter of fact, Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) appealed to the natural feeling of man that he is his own well-wisher and cannot wish ill of himself deliberately. This would inevitably have led the addressees to think whether what they were doing was really for their good and was in no way harmful.


## Ayat 78

- `Who created me and Who guides me;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the first reason for which Allah, and One Allah alone, is worthy of man’s worship. The people also knew and believed that Allah alone was their Creator without any partner. Not only they but all the polytheists of the world also have always held the belief that even the deities they worshiped were the creation of Allah, and except for the atheists none have ever denied that Allah is the Creator of the whole universe. This argument of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) implied that being a creature, he could only worship his Creator, Who was alone worthy of his worship, and none else, because none besides Allah had any share in His creation.

## Ayat 79

- `Who gives me food and drink,`

## Ayat 80

- `and Who, when I am ill, heals me;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The second reason for worshiping Allah and Allah alone is that Allah has not become unconcerned with man after creating him and has not left him alone to seek other supporters for help, but has also taken the responsibility of making arrangements for his guidance, protection and fulfillment of his needs.
  - The moment a human child is born, milk is produced for it in the breasts of his mother, and some unseen power teaches it the way to suck it and take it down the throat. From the first day of his life till his death, the Creator has provided in the world around him all necessary means required for every stage of his life for his development and guidance, sustenance and survival. He has also endowed him with all those powers and abilities which are needed to use the means with advantage and given him all necessary guidance for every sphere of life. Then for the protection of human life against all sorts of disease, germs and poisons, He has created such effective antidotes that they have not yet been fully encompassed by human knowledge. If these natural arrangements had not been made, even a thorn-prick would have proved fatal.
  - When this all-pervading mercy and providence of the Creator is supporting and sustaining man at all times in every way, there could be no greater folly and ingratitude on the part of man than this that he should bow down before others than Allah and seek their help in need and trouble.

## Ayat 81

- `Who will cause me to die and then will again restore me to life;`

## Ayat 82

- `Who, I hope, will forgive me my sins on the Day of Judgement."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The third reason for worshiping none but Allah is that man’s relation with his God is not merely confined to this worldly life, which will end at death, but extends to lifeafter- death also.
  - The same God Who brought him into existence, recalls him and there is no power which can stop his return from the world. No remedy, no physician, no god or goddess has ever been able to catch the hand which takes man out of this world. Even all those men who were made deities and worshiped could not ward off their own deaths. Only Allah judges and decides when a particular person is to be recalled from the world, and whenever somebody is recalled by Him, he has to leave this world in any case. Then it is Allah alone Who will decide as to when He should raise back to life all those people who were born in this world and died and buried here, and ask them to account for their worldly lives. Then also nobody will have the power to stop resurrection of himself or others. Every human being will have to rise at the command of Allah and appear in His court. Then Allah alone will be the Judge on that Day, and nobody else will be a partner in his judgment in any degree. To punish or to forgive will be entirely in Allah’s hand. Nobody will have the power to get somebody forgiven if Allah would want to punish him, and punished if Allah would want to forgive him. All those who are regarded as intercessors in the world, will themselves be hoping for Allah’s mercy and grace for their forgiveness.
  - In view of these facts anybody who worships others than Allah, is in fact preparing for his own doom. There can be no greater misfortune than this that man should turn away from Allah Who controls his life here as well as in the Hereafter, and should turn for help and support to those who are utterly powerless in this regard.

## Ayat 83

- `(And then Abraham prayed):`
  - `"My Lord, endow me with knowledge and wisdom`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Hukm here does not mean Prophethood, because at the time this prayer was made, Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) had already been appointed a Prophet. Even if this prayer was made before that, Prophethood is not bestowed at request, but it is something which Allah Himself bestows on those He wills. That is why hukm has been translated wisdom, knowledge, right understanding and power of judgment.
      - The Prophet (peace be upon him) is also reported to have made a similar prayer. Arinal-ashyaa kama hiya: **O Allah, give us the power to see and understand a thing as it really is and to form an opinion about it according to its reality.**
  - `and join me with the righteous,`
    - Tahim-ul-Quran:
      - “Join me with the righteous”: Give me a righteous society to live here in this world and raise me along with the righteous in the Hereafter. To be raised back to life with the righteous and to attain one’s salvation have one and the same meaning. Therefore, this should be the prayer of every person who believes in the life-after-death and in reward and punishment.
      - Even in this world a pious man cherishes the desire that God should save him from living a life in an immoral and wicked society and should join him with the righteous people. A pious and righteous person will remain ill at ease and restless until either his own society should become clean and pure morally, or he leaves it to join another society which is practicing and following the principles of truth and honesty.

## Ayat 84

- `and grant me an honorable mention in posterity;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, grant me true renown among posterity.
  - Grant me the grace that posterity should remember me as a good and pious man after my death and not as one of the unjust people, who were not only wicked themselves, but who left nothing but wickedness behind them in the world.
  - Enable me to perform such high deeds that my life should become a source of light for others for all times to come, and I should be counted among the benefactors of humanity.
  - This is not a prayer for worldly greatness and renown, but for true greatness and renown, which can be achieved only as a result of solid and valuable services.
  - A person’s achieving such true renown and glory has two good aspects:


## Ayat 85

- `and make me of those who will inherit the Garden of Bliss,`

## Ayat 86

- `and forgive my father for he is among those who strayed,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Some commentators have interpreted this prayer of Prophet Abraham for his father’s forgiveness to imply that he had prayed to God to grant his father the favor to accept Islam because forgiveness in any case is inter-linked with and dependent upon faith.
  - But this interpretation is not borne out by the other verses of the Quran. The Quran says that when Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) left his home at the tyrannical treatment of his father, he said: **I bid farewell to you; I shall pray to my Lord to forgive you for He is very kind to me.** (Surah Maryam, Ayat 47).
  - To fulfill this promise, he not only prayed for the forgiveness of his father, but for both his parents: **Lord, forgive me and my parents.** (Surah Ibrahim, Ayat 41).
  - But afterwards he himself realized that an enemy of the truth, even if he be the father of a believer, does not deserve a prayer of forgiveness. Thus according to (verse 114 of Surah At- Taubah): The prayer of Abraham for his father was only to fulfill a promise he had made to him, but when he realized that he was an enemy of Allah, he disowned him.

## Ayat 87

- `and disgrace me not on the Day when people will be raised to life,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, do not put me to disgrace on the Day of Judgment by inflicting punishment on my father in front of all mankind, when I myself shall be witnessing his punishment helplessly.

## Ayat 88

- `the Day when nothing will avail, neither wealth nor offspring,`

## Ayat 89

- `but only he that brings to Allah a sound heart will (attain to success)."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It cannot be said with certainty whether verses 88, 89 are a part of Prophet Abraham’s (peace be upon him) prayer, or they are an addition by Allah.
  - In the first case, they will mean that Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) while praying for his father had a full realization of these facts.
  - In the second case, they will be a comment by Allah on Abraham’s (peace be upon him) prayer, as if to say: On the Day of Judgment, only a sound heart, sound in faith and free from disobedience and sin, will be of any avail to man and not wealth and children, for wealth and children can be useful only if one possesses a sound heart. Wealth will be useful if one would have spent it sincerely and faithfully for the sake of Allah, otherwise even a millionaire will be a poor man there. Children also will be of help only to the extent that a person might have educated them in faith and good conduct to the best of his ability; otherwise even if the son is a Prophet, his father will not escape punishment if he died in the state of unbelief, because such a father will have no share in the goodness of his children.



## Ayat 90

- `(On that Day) the Garden will be brought near to the God-fearing,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - (Verses 90-102) do not seem to be a part of Prophet Abraham’s (peace be upon him) speech, but they are Allah’s words.

## Ayat 91

- `and the Fire will be uncovered for those who strayed,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, on the one hand, the righteous people will be shown the countless blessings which they will enjoy in Paradise by Allah’s grace, and on the other hand, Hell will be set open with all its dreads and horrors before the straying people, when they will still be in the Plain of Resurrection.

## Ayat 92

- `and they will be asked:`
  - `"Where are the gods that you worshipped`

## Ayat 93

- `beside Allah? Can they be of any help to you, or even be of any help to themselves?"`

## Ayat 94  

- `Then the idols and those who strayed will be hurled into the Fire headlong, one upon another,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Kubkibu in the text has two meanings:
    - (1) They will be hurled into Hell one upon the other; and 
    - (2) they will go on rolling down into the depths of Hell.


## Ayat 95

- `and so too the hosts of Iblis, all of them.`

## Ayat 96

- `There they will quarrel with one another and the erring ones will say (to their deities):`

## Ayat 97

- `"By Allah, we were surely in clear error`

## Ayat 98

- `when we assigned to you a position equal to that of the Lord of the Universe.`

## Ayat 99

- `It is none but those steeped in guilt who led us into this error,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is how the followers will treat their religious leaders and guides, whom they served and revered like deities in the world, whose words and patterns of behavior they took as authoritative and before whom they presented all sorts of offerings in the world.
  - In the Hereafter when the people will find that their guides had misled them and caused their ruin as well as their own, they will hold them responsible for it and will curse them. The Quran has presented this horrible scene of the Hereafter at several places so as to admonish the blind followers to see and judge carefully whether their guides in this world were leading them on the right path or not.
  - For instance: As each generation will be entering Hell, it will curse its preceding generation till all generations shall be gathered together there; then each succeeding generation will say regarding the preceding one: 
  - **O Lord, these were the people who led us astray; therefore give them a double chastisement of the Fire. Allah will reply: There is a double chastisement for everyone but you know it not.** 
    - (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 38).
  - And the disbelievers will say:
  - **Our Lord, bring those jinns and men before us, who led us astray so that we may trample them under our feet and put them to extreme disgrace.**
    - (Surah Ha Mim Sajdah, Ayat 29). 
  - And they will say:
  - **Our Lord, we obeyed our chiefs and our great men and they misled us from the right path; our Lord, give them a double chastisement and curse them with a severe curse.**
    - (Surah Al-Ahzab, Ayat 67-68).

## Ayat 100

- `and now we have none to intercede on our behalf,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, those whom we regarded as our intercessors in the world and who, we believed, would take us safely into Paradise, are utterly helpless today and of no avail to us.

## Ayat 101

- `nor do we have a truly sincere friend.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, we have no sympathizer either who could feel for us and console us.
  - The Quran says that in the Hereafter only the believers will continue to be friends;
  - as for the disbelievers, they will turn enemies of one another even though they had been sworn friends in the world.
  - Each will hold the other as responsible for the doom and try to get him maximum punishment.
  - Friends on that Day will become enemies of one another except the righteous (who will continue to be friends). (Surah Az-Zukhruf, Ayat 67).


## Ayat 102

- `If only we could return we would be among the believers."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That Quran has given an answer to this kind of longing and desire as well: **Even if they be sent back to the earthly life, they would do all that they had been forbidden to do.** (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayat 28).
  - As for the reasons why they will not be allowed to return to the world, please see(E.Ns 90-92 of Surah Al-Mominoon) above.


## Ayat 103

- `Surely there is a Sign in this,`
- `but most of them would not believe.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There are two aspects of the sign in the story of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him).
    - (1) On the one hand, the mushriks of Arabia, especially the Quraish, claimed that they were the followers of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) and were proud of being his descendants, but on the other hand, they were involved in shirk against which Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) had been engaged in a relentless struggle throughout his life. Then these people were opposing and treating the Prophet (peace be upon him) who was inviting them towards the religion brought by Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him). They have been reminded that Abraham (peace be upon him) was an enemy of shirk and an upholder of Tauhid which they themselves admitted, and yet they persisted in their obduracy to follow the creed of shirk.
    - (2) The people of Abraham (peace be upon him) were eliminated from the world. If any of them survived, it was the children of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) and his sons, Ishmael and Isaac (peace be upon them). Though the Quran does not mention the torment that descended on Abraham’s people after he had left them, it has included them among the tormented tribes: **Has not the story reached them of those who had gone before them: the people of Noah, the tribes of Aad and Thamud, the people of Abraham, and the inhabitants of Midian and of the overturned cities?** (Surah At-Taubah, Ayat 70).

## Ayat 104

- `Verily Your Lord is Immensely Mighty, Ever Compassionate.`
