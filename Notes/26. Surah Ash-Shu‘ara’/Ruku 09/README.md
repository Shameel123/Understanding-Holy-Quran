## Ayat 165

- `What, of all creation will you go to (fornicate with) the males,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This can have two meanings.
    - (1) Of all the creatures you have chosen males only for the purpose of gratifying your sex desires, whereas there are plenty of women in the world.
    - (2) You alone are the people in the whole world, who go to men to satisfy the sex desires; even the animals do not resort to this. 
    - This second meaning has been explained in Surahs Al-Aaraf and Al-Ankabut thus: **Have you become so shameless that you commit such indecent acts as no one committed before you in the world?**(Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 80).

## Ayat 166

- `leaving aside those whom Allah has created for you as your mates.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This can also have two meanings.
      - (1) You leave your wives whom God has created for you to satisfy your sex desire and adopt unnatural ways with the males for the purpose. 
      - (2) Even with respect to your wives you do not follow the natural way but adopt unnatural ways for the gratification of your lust? This they might have been doing with the intention of family planning.

- `Nay, you are a people that has transgressed all limits."`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, this is not the only vice in you; your whole lives have become corrupted and perverted, as stated in(Surah An-Naml, Ayat 54) thus: **Do you commit indecent acts openly and publicly?** And in (Surah Al-Ankabut, Ayat 29 )thus: **Have you become so perverted that you gratify your lust with the males, you rob travelers, and you commit wicked deeds publicly in your assemblies?** For further details, see (E.N. 39 of Surah Al-Hijr).

  - `"I am one of those who abhor your practice.`

## Ayat 169

- `My Lord, deliver me and my family from their wicked deeds."`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This may also mean: My Lord, deliver us from the evil consequences of their misdeeds, and also this: Protect the children of the believers from the evil effects of the immoral acts of the wicked people.

## Ayat 170

- `Then We delivered him and all his family`

## Ayat 171

- `except an old woman who was among those that stayed behind.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This refers to the Prophet Lotâ€™s (peace be upon him) wife as stated in (verse 10 of Surah At-Tahrim) about the wives of Prophets Noah and Lot (peace be upon them): **These two women were in the houses of Our two pious servants but they acted treacherously towards them. That is, they did not believe, and sided with the unbelievers instead of their righteous husbands.**
    - Therefore, when Allah decreed to send a torment on the people of Prophet Lot (peace be upon him), He commanded the Prophet Lot (peace be upon him) to leave the place along with his people but to leave his wife behind: **So depart from here with the people of your household in the last hours of the night. And look here: none of you should turn round to look behind; but your wife (who will not accompany you) shall meet the same doom as they.**(Surah Houd, Ayat 81).

## Ayat 172

- `Thereafter, We utterly destroyed the rest,`

## Ayat 173

- `and We sent upon them a rain,`
- `an evil rain that fell on those who had been warned.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This was not a rain of water but a rain of stones. 
  - According to the details given at other places in the Quran, when Prophet Lot (peace be upon him) had left the place along with the people of his household in the last hours of the night, there occurred a terrible explosion at dawn and a violent earthquake, which turned all their habitations upside down and rained on them stones of baked clay as a result of a volcanic eruption and a strong blast of wind.

## Ayat 174
