**Ayat 123 - 140**

## Ayat 123

- `The Ad gave the lie to the Messengers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For comparison, see (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 65-72); (Surah Houd, Ayats 50-60); and for further details of this story, see (Surah HaMim Sajdah, Ayats 13-16); (Surah Al- Ahqaf, Ayats 21-26); (Surah Az-Zariyat, Ayats 41,45);(Surah Al-Qamar, Ayats 18-22);(Surah Al-Haqqah, Ayats 4-8); and (Surah AI-Fajr, Ayats 6-8).

## Ayat 124

- `Recall, when their brother Hud said to them:`
  - `"Have you no fear?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In order to understand this discourse of Prophet Houd fully, we should keep in mind the various details about the people of Aad which the Quran has given at different places: For instance, it says:

## Ayat 125

- `I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.`

## Ayat 126

- `So fear Allah and obey me.`

## Ayat 127

- `I seek of you no reward for this;`
- `my reward is with none but the Lord of the Universe.`

## Ayat 128

- `What, you build a monument on every hill merely for fun`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, you build grand buildings merely to show off your wealth and power, whereas they have no use and purpose except that they stand as monuments to your grandeur and glory.

## Ayat 129

- `and erect huge palaces as though you will live for ever,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, though you have built other buildings also for dwelling purposes, in order to make them grand, beautiful and strong, you expend your wealth and mental and physical abilities in a manner as if you were going to live forever, and there was no purpose of life except seeking of comfort and pleasure and nothing beyond this worldly life which might deserve your attention.

## Ayat 130

- `and when you strike you strike like tyrants?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, in order to meet the demands of your ever rising standards of life, you do not rest content with small living quarters but you build castles and fortresses, and yet being unsatisfied you erect lofty edifices unnecessarily just for ostentation.
  - But as human beings you have become so depraved that there is no mercy in your hearts for the weak, no justice for the poor, and all people of lower social strata, living inside or around your land, are being oppressed tyrannically and none is safe from your barbarities.

## Ayat 131

- `So fear Allah and obey me.`

## Ayat 132

- `Have fear of Him Who has provided you with all the (good) things you know;`

## Ayat 133

- `Who has provided you with flocks and children`

## Ayat 134

- `and with gardens and springs.`

## Ayat 135

- `I fear for you the chastisement of an Awesome Day."`

## Ayat 136

- `They replied:`
  - `"It is all the same for us whether you admonish us or not.`

## Ayat 137

- `This has been happening all along.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This can have two meanings.
    - (1) Whatever we are doing is not new but has been happening from the time of our elders since centuries: they had the same creed, the same way of life, the same morality and the same kind of dealings and yet they remained unharmed and safe from every calamity. If there was any evil in this way of life, we should have met the doom with which you are threatening us.
    - (2) The things you are preaching have also been preached and said before by religious maniacs and so-called moralists, but they could not change the ways of the world. It has never happened that the world suffered a disaster only because people refused to listen to preachers like you.


## Ayat 138

- `We will not be subjected to any chastisement."`

## Ayat 139

- `Eventually they gave the lie to him and We destroyed them.`
- `Surely there is a Sign in this, but most of them would not believe.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - According to the Quran, the people of Aad were destroyed by a violent windstorm. When they saw it advancing towards their valleys, they rejoiced with the hope that those were dense clouds which would bring much rain for them, but in reality it was Allahâ€™s scourge. **The windstorm continued to rage for eight days and seven nights and destroyed everything.** The people were swept away like straw and everything on which the hot, dry wind blew was left rotting. The storm did not abate until the last man of the wicked tribe had met his doom. Only ruins of their habitations remained to tell the tale of their terrible fate, and today even the ruins have become extinct. The whole territory of Ahqaf has turned into dreadful desert dunes. For details, see(E.N. 25 of Surah Al-Ahqaf).


## Ayat 140

- `Verily your Lord is Immensely Mighty, Most Compassionate.`
