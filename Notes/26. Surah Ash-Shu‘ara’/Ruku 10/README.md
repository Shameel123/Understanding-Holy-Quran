**Ayat 176 - 191**

## Ayat 176

- `The people of Aykah also gave the lie to the Messengers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The people of Aiykah have been briefly mentioned in verses 78-84 of Surah Al-Hijr. More about them here. 
  - .There is a difference of opinion among the commentators as to whether the Midianites and the people of Aiykah were two different tribes or one and the same people. One group holds that they were different tribes and gives the argument that in Surah Al-Aaraf Prophet Shuaib (peace be upon him) has been brother of the Midianites (verse 85), whereas here, with regard to the people of Aiykah, he has not been called so. The other group holds that they were one and the same people on the ground that the moral diseases and characteristics mentioned of the Midianites in Surahs Al-Aaraf and Houd are the same as of the people of Aiykah mentioned here. Then the message and admonition of Prophet Shuaib (peace be upon him) to both the tribes was the same, and the two tribes also met the same end.

## Ayat 177

- `Recall, when Shuayb said to them:`
  - `"Have you no fear?`

## Ayat 178

## Ayat 179

- `So fear Allah and obey me.`

## Ayat 180

- `I ask of you no reward for this.`
- `My reward is with none but the Lord of the Universe.`

## Ayat 181

- `Fill up the measure and do not diminish the goods of people,`

## Ayat 182

- `weigh with an even balance`

## Ayat 183

- `and do not deliver short, and do not go about creating mischief in the land,`

## Ayat 184

- `and have fear of Him Who created you and the earlier generations."`

## Ayat 185

- `They said:`
  - `"You are no more than one of those who have been bewitched,`

## Ayat 186

- `you are only a mortal like us. Indeed we believe that you are an utter liar`.

## Ayat 187

- `So cause a piece of the sky to fall upon us if you are truthful."`

## Ayat 188

- `Shuayb said:`
  - `"My Lord knows well all what you do."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, it is not in my power to bring down the torment; it is in Allahâ€™s power, and He is fully aware of your misdeeds. He will send down the torment as and when He wills.
  - In this demand of the people of Aiykah and the answer of Prophet Shuaib (peace be upon him) to them there was an admonition for the Quraish as well. They also demanded from the Prophet (peace be upon him) to bring down the torment on them: Or.... you cause the sky to fall down on us in fragments, as you threaten us. (Surah Bani Israil, Ayat 92). As such the Quraish are being told that the people of Aiykah had also demanded a similar thing from their Prophet, and the answer that they got from their Prophet is the answer of Muhammad (peace be on him) to you.

## Ayat 189

- `Then they branded him a liar, whereupon the chastisement of the Day of Canopy overtook them. It was the chastisement of a very awesome day`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The details of this torment are neither found in the Quran nor in any authentic tradition. What one can learn from the text is this: As these people had demanded a torment from the sky, Allah sent upon them a cloud which hung over them like a canopy and kept hanging until they were completely destroyed by the torment of continuous rain.
  - **The Quran clearly points out that the nature of the torment sent upon the Midianites was different from that sent upon the people of Aiykah.**
  - The people of Aiykah, as mentioned here, were destroyed by the torment of the canopy, while the torment visiting the Midianites was in the form of a terrible earthquake: **It so happened that a shocking catastrophe overtook them and they remained lying prostrate in their dwellings.** (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 91). And: **A dreadful shock overtook them and they lay lifeless and prostrate in their homes.** (Surah Houd, Ayat 94).
  - Therefore, it is wrong to regard the two torments as identical. Some commentators have given a few explanations of the torment of the Day of canopy, but we do not know the source of their information. Ibn Jarir has quoted Abdullah bin Abbas as saying: If somebody from among the scholars gives you an explanation of the torment of the Day of canopy, do not consider it as correct.

## Ayat 190

- `Surely there is a Sign in this, but most of them would not believe.`

## Ayat 191

- `Verily Your Lord is Immensely Mighty, Most Compassionate.`
