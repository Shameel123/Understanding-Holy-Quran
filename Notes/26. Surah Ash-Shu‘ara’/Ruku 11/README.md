**Ayat 192 - 227**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - At the end of the historical account, the same theme, with which the Surah began, is resumed. For reference, see(verses 1-9).

## Ayat 192

- `Indeed this is a revelation from the Lord of the Universe;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, this lucid Book whose verses are being recited to you, and this admonition from which the people are turning away, is not the product of the whims of a man.
  - It has not been written and compiled by Muhammad (peace be upon him) himself, but it consists of the revelations of the Lord of this universe.

## Ayat 193

- `which the truthful spirit has carried down`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, Angel Gabriel, as mentioned in (Surah Al- Baqarah, Ayat 97): Say to them: Whosoever is the enemy to Gabriel, he should understand that he has, by Allah’s command, revealed to your heart the Quran. Here the object of using the title of the trustworthy Spirit for Gabriel implies that the Quran is not being sent down by Allah through some material agency, which is subject to change and vacillation; but through a pure Spirit, having no tinge of materialism, and who is perfectly trustworthy. This Spirit conveys the messages of Allah precisely in the same form and with the same content as they are entrusted to him. It is not possible for him to tamper with the messages, or to make his own additions to them in any way.


## Ayat 194

- `to your heart that you might become one of those who warn (others on behalf of Allah),`

## Ayat 195

- `(a revelation) in clear Arabic language,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This sentence may be related to **“the trustworthy Spirit has come down”** and also to: **“who are (appointed by God) to warn.”**
  - In the first case, it will mean that the trustworthy Spirit has brought it down in plain Arabic language, and in the second case, it will mean that the Prophet (peace be upon him) is included among those Prophets who were appointed to warn the people in the Arabic language, i.e. Houd, Salih, Ishmael and Shuaib (peace be upon them all).
  - In both cases the object is the same: the divine message has not been sent down in a dead or mysterious language, or in a language of riddles and enigmas, but in such clear and lucid Arabic, which can be understood easily by every Arab and every non Arab who has learned Arabic. As such, the people who are turning away from it, they cannot have the excuse that they could not understand the message of the Quran. 
  - The only reason of their denial and aversion is that they are afflicted with the same disease with which Pharaoh, the people of Abraham the people of Noah, the people of Lot, the Aad and the Thamud, and the people of Aiykah were afflicted.

## Ayat 196

- `(a revelation embodied) in the scriptures of the ancients.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, this very admonition and divine message and teachings are contained in the former Scriptures also. 
  - The same message of submission to One God, the same belief in the Hereafter and the same invitation to follow the Prophets has been given in all those Books. All the Books sent down by God condemn shirk and the materialistic philosophy of life and invite people to accept the true and sound philosophy of life, which is based on the concept of man’s accountability before God, and demands that man should give up his independence in deference to divine commands brought and preached by the Prophets.
  - None of these things is new, which the Quran may be presenting for the first time, and none can blame the Prophet (peace be upon him) of saying something which had never been said before by the former Prophets.

## Ayat 197

- `Is it not a Sign to them � (to wit, the Makkans) � that the learned men of the Children of Israel know that?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the learned men of the Israelites know that the teachings of the Quran are the same as of the former Scriptures.
  - Though the people of Makkah themselves were un-initiated in the knowledge of the Book, there were many scholars among the Israelites living in the surrounding areas, who fully understood that the Quran did not bring a novel message, which was being presented by Muhammad bin Abdullah for the first time, but it was the same message which had been brought and preached by Prophets of Allah one after the other since thousands of years. Is it not then a convincing proof of the fact that the Quran has been sent down by the same Lord of the universe Who sent down the former Books.

## Ayat 198

- `(But such is their adamance) that had We revealed it to one of the non-Arabs and even if he had recited(this clear Arabic discourse) to them`

## Ayat 199

- `they would still not have believed in it.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, now when a man from among themselves is reciting to them this divine revelation in lucid Arabic, they say that he himself has composed it, and therefore it cannot be from Allah. But if the same revelation in eloquent Arabic had been sent down by Allah to a non Arab as a miracle, and he had recited it before them in perfect Arabic accent, they would have invented some other excuse for not believing in him. They would have said that he is under the power and influence of a jinn, who speaks Arabic through a non Arab.
  - As a matter of fact, a lover of the truth considers the thing presented before him coolly and forms an opinion about it after due thought. But an obdurate person who is unwilling to believe, pays no attention to it at all, but instead seeks all sorts of excuses to reject it, and will, in any case, invent an excuse for his denial. This obduracy of the unbelieving Quraish has been exposed over and over again in the Quran, and they have been clearly told that even if a miracle were shown to them, they would certainly have found an excuse to deny it because they are not inclined to believe: **O Messenger, even if We had sent down to you a Book written on paper, and even if they had touched it with their own hands, the disbelievers would have said: This is nothing but manifest sorcery.** (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayat 7). **Even if We had opened a gate for them in heaven, and they had begun to ascend through it, they would have said: Our eyes have been dazzled; nay, we have been bewitched.** (Surah Al-Hijr, Ayats 14-15).


## Ayat 200

- `Thus have We caused this (Admonition) to penetrate the hearts of the culprits (like a hot rod).`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, unlike the truth loving people to whom the Quran brings peace of the mind and heart, it passes like a hot iron rod through the hearts of the disbelievers, which sets them ill at ease, and they, instead of pondering over its themes, start looking for subterfuges to deny it.

## Ayat 201

- `They will not believe in it until they see the grievous punishment (that will overtake them) with their own eyes.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, until the criminals are actually overtaken by the torment, they do not believe in the Prophet. Then they feel remorse and desire to be given some respite when it is too late.

## Ayat 202

- `But when it comes upon them suddenly, taking them unawares,`

## Ayat 203

- `they say:`
  - `"Can we be granted some respite?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There is a subtle gap between this and the preceding sentence, which the reader himself can fill with a little thinking. They were asking for the torment to be hastened because they were not sure that it would ever come. They were confident that they would continue living a life of ease and indulgence as they had been living till then. On account of the same confidence they challenged the Prophet (peace be upon him), as if to say: If you are a Messenger of Allah, and we deserve to be chastised by Allah because we have treated you as a liar, then you should hasten that torment on us, with which you threaten us. At this it is being said: Well, even if they be right in their confidence, and the torment is not sent upon them immediately, and they are allowed a long respite to enjoy life as they expect, the question is: **What will these few years of worldly pleasure and comfort avail them when the inevitable scourge from Allah overtakes them suddenly as it overtook the Aad and the Thamud, or the people of Lot and of Aiykah, or if they are visited by death which nobody can escape.**

## Ayat 204

- `Do they really want Our chastisement to be expedited?`

## Ayat 205

- `Did you consider that if We were to let them enjoy life for many years`

## Ayat 206

- `and then the chastisement of which they were being warned were to come upon them,`


## Ayat 207

- `of what avail will be the provisions of life which they have been granted to enjoy?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, We could not be blamed for any injustice when they did not heed the warning and admonition of the warners and were destroyed. It would have been injustice if no effort had been made to admonish them and guide them aright prior to their destruction.

## Ayat 208

- `We never destroyed any habitation but that it had warners`

## Ayat 209

- `to admonish them. We have never been unjust.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - After the positive aspect as stated in (verses 192-193), the negative aspect is being stated that the Quran has not been brought down by satans as the enemies of the truth allege.
  - The unbelieving Quraish in their campaign to spread lies and slander against the Prophet (peace be upon him) were facing a real difficulty. They did not know how to account for the wonderful discourses which were being presented before the people in the form of the Quran and which were moving their hearts deeply. They could not stop the Quran from reaching the people. The only thing they could do to counteract its effect and influence was to create doubts and suspicions about it in their minds and hearts. Therefore, in their desperation they charged that Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a sorcerer, who was being inspired by the satans, and they considered this charge of theirs to be the most effective because it could neither be easily verified nor refuted.


## Ayat 210

- `The satans did not bring down this (Clear Book),`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, these revelations and themes do not at all suit the satans. Any person who has a little common sense can well understand that the sublime discourses being presented in the Quran cannot be inspired by the satans. Never has it happened that the satans might have taught the people through the sorcerers to worship God and fear Him, or forbidden them from shirk and idol-worship, or warned them of the accountability of the Hereafter, or prohibited them from tyranny and sexual and moral evils, and exhorted them instead to act righteously and do good to others.
  - Such works cannot behoove the satans. Their only pastime can be to sow the seeds of discord among the people and to arouse them to mischief and vice. The common observation is that people visit the sorcerers to find out whether they will succeed in their love affairs or not, what move would suit them in gambling, what trick and stratagem would be helpful against the enemy, or who had stolen the camel of so and so. Apart from such affairs and problems, the sorcerers and their patron-saints cannot be expected to worry themselves about matters like reforming the people, teaching them morals and cleansing their lives of vice and evil.

## Ayat 211 

- `nor does it behove them,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, even if the satans wanted they could not impart truth and goodness to the people like a true teacher and reformer as the Quran does. Even if to deceive the people, they came out under the guise of a benefactor, their work would not be tree from blemishes, which would betray their ignorance and their hidden satanic nature.
    - Similarly the life and the teachings of a person who poses to be a religious guide, under the influence and inspiration of satans, would inevitably reflect the wickedness of intention and design. Thus the satans can neither inspire others with piety and goodness, nor can those, who have any relation with the satans, become pious and righteous themselves.
    - Then in addition to its high and noble teachings, the Quran is a lucid and eloquent Book, which contains the knowledge of reality. That is why it has over and over again put forward the challenge that human beings and jinns would never be able to produce a book like the Quran even if they collaborated with all their energies and capacities. Declare this: **Even if human beings and jinns should cooperate with one another to bring forth a book like the Quran, they will never be able to bring anything like it, even though all of them help one another** (Surah Bani Israil, Ayat 88).
- `nor does it lie in their power.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **Tell them: if what you say be true, then produce one Surah like this, and you may call to your assistance anyone you can other than Allah.** (Surah Yunus, Ayat 38).

## Ayat 212 

- `Indeed they are debarred from even hearing it.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This does not mean that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was going to be involved in shirk from which he was to be admonished to desist. The object was to warn the disbelievers and polytheists to the effect: As the message of the Quran is based on pure truth revealed by the Almighty Ruler of the universe, and there is no tinge of any satanic impurity in it, there could be no question of showing a favor to somebody in regard to the truth. Even if the Messenger (peace be upon him) himself, who is nearest to Allah and His most beloved servant, deviated a little from the path of His obedience and invoked any other deity than Allah, he could not escape the punishment. When it was so in the case of the Prophet, who else could have the hope that after committing shirk with regard to Allah, he would be able to escape the punishment or help others to escape it.

## Ayat 213

- `So do not call any other god beside Allah lest you become of those who will be punished,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Just as there could be no concession or favor for the person of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in a matter concerning Allah’s religion, so there could be no question of a favor being shown to the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) family or his nearest kinsfolk. Here the case of everybody will be judged on merit, and nobody will be shown any favor on account of his ancestry or relation with somebody else. The accountability of the Hereafter and punishment for deviation and misdeeds are the same for everybody and even the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) nearest kinsfolk are no exception. Therefore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) was commanded to warn his relatives and kindred to attain the right belief and to act righteously because they would not escape punishment only by virtue of being his relations.

## Ayat 214

- `and warn your nearest kinsmen;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This can have two meanings.

## Ayat 215

- `and be meek to the believers who follow you.`

## Ayat 216

- `Then if they disobey you say to them:`
  - `"I am quit of what you do."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, you should not care at all for any worldly power, howsoever big and strong, but should continue to perform your mission with complete trust in that Being Who is Mighty as well as Merciful. He is Mighty and, therefore, anybody enjoying His support, cannot be overcome by any other power; He is Merciful and, therefore, He will not let go waste the sacrifices and efforts of the one who struggles for the sake of raising His Word in the world.

## Ayat 217

- `And put your trust in Him Who is Immensely Mighty, Most Compassionate,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Stand up” may mean getting up for the Prayers during the night, or coming out for the purpose of performing the Prophetic mission.

## Ayat 218

- `Who observes you when you rise (to pray)`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This can have several meanings.

## Ayat 219

- `and observes your movements among those who prostrate themselves.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This implies the sorcerers, astrologers, fortune-tellers and conjurers who pose as knower of the unseen and tell the people their future, or as wise men who have control over jinns and spirits and can make the destinies of the people through them.

(I think Tafsir for Tahfim-ul-Quran is out of sync on quran.com)

## Ayat 220

- `He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.`

## Ayat 221

- `O people, shall I tell you on whom it is that satans descend?`

## Ayat 222

- `They descend on every forgerer steeped in sin,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This may have two meanings.
    - (1) The satans somehow get a little hint of the truth and inspire their agents with it, mixing it with all kinds of falsehood.
    - (2) The deceitful, unscrupulous sorcerers hear something from the satans and then mixing it with falsehood, whisper it into the people’s ears. This has been explained in a tradition which Bukhari has quoted on the authority of Aishah. **She says that when some people asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) about sorcerers, he replied that they were nothing. They said: O Messenger of Allah, they, sometimes, tell the right thing. The Prophet (peace be upon him) answered: That right thing is overheard by the jinns who whisper it into their friend’s ear, who concocts a story by mixing a lot of falsehood in it.**

## Ayat 223

- `on those who whisper hearsay in the ears of people;`
- `and most of them are liars.`

## Ayat 224

- `As for poets, only the wayward follow them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, they follow no fixed pattern for their thought and speech but wander aimlessly in every valley. 
  - Every new impulse makes them take up a new theme regardless as to whether it has any truth in it or not. 
  - Under one momentary impulse they would start uttering wise things; under another they would give expression to filthy and base feelings.
  - If they felt pleased with somebody, they would exaggerate his praises, and if they felt offended by him, they would condemn him and run him down to hell.
  - If they had a selfish motive, attached with somebody, they would feel no hesitation in giving preference to a miserly person over a generous person and to a cowardly person over a gallant person.
  - On the contrary, if they felt displeased with somebody, they would not feel any shame in blotting his character and ridiculing him and his ancestors.
  - That is why, one can find God-worship and atheism, materialism and spiritualism, morality and immorality, piety and filthiness, seriousness and jesting, eulogy and satire expressed side by side in the poetry of one and the same poet.
  - A person who is aware of these well known characteristics of the poets cannot reconcile himself to charging the recipient of the Quran with poetry, whose every discourse and word is clear and precise, whose objective is clearly defined, and who has never in his life uttered a word deviating in any way from the path of truth, righteousness and virtue.

## Ayat 225

- `Do you not see that they wander about in every valley`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This characteristic of the poets was just the antithesis of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) conduct and practice. **Everybody knew that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said what he practiced and practiced what he said.** The fact that there was complete conformity between his word and deed could not be denied by anybody. 
  - On the contrary, everyone was well aware that the poets said one thing and practiced just the opposite of it. For instance, they would express noble themes of generosity, indifference to worldly wealth, contentment and self-respect in their poetry, but, in practical life, they would turn out to be extremely stingy and cowardly, avaricious and selfish. They would find fault with others on trifles, but would themselves be involved in grave moral weaknesses.

## Ayat 226

- `and say things which they do not act upon,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here those poets have made an exception from the general reproach, who possess the following four characteristics:

## Ayat 227

- `except those`
- `who believed and`
- `acted righteously and`
- `remembered Allah much,`
- `and when they themselves were subjected to wrong, they exacted retribution no more than to the extent of the wrong?`
- `Soon will the wrong-doers know the end that they shall reach.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Those who do wrong”: The people who out of sheer obduracy calumniated the Prophet (peace be upon him) of being a sorcerer, poet and a mad and enchanted man, in order to defeat Islam, and to confuse the other people and distract them from his message and invitation.
