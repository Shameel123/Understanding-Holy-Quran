**Ayat 01 - 09**

## Ayat 01

- `Ta'. Sin. Mim.`

## Ayat 02

- `These are the verses of the Clear Book.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the verses being presented in this Surah are of that Book, which presents and explains its subject-matter clearly and plainly so that every reader and listener may easily understand what it invites to, what it enjoins and what it forbids, and what it regards as true and what as false. To believe or not to believe is a different matter; but no one can have the excuse that he could not understand the teachings of the Book and its injunctions and prohibitions.

## Ayat 03

- `(O Muhammad), you will perhaps grieve yourself to death because these people do not believe.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The words bakhiun-nafsaka literally mean: You would kill yourself. The verse in fact describes the extreme anguish, anxiety and grief of the Prophet (peace be upon him) over the Makkan disbelieversâ€™ ways of deviation, moral degradation, and obduracy and opposition to his message of reform.
  - Sometimes it seemed as if his grief and mental suffering for their sake would cause his death.
  - This state of the Prophet (peace be upon him) has been referred to at other places in the Quran as well, for instance in (Surah Al-Kahf, Ayat 6), thus: **Well, O Muhammad, it may be that you will consume your life for their sake out of sorrow if they do not believe in this message.** And in (Surah Al-Fatir, Ayat 8), thus: **Let not your life be consumed in grief for their sake.**


## Ayat 04

- `If We will, We can send down a Sign to them from heaven, so their necks will be humbled to it.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, it is not at all difficult for Allah to send down a sign which would make all the disbelievers yield and submit.
  - If, however, He does not send one, it does not mean that such a thing is beyond His powers, but the reason is that the belief under compulsion is not acceptable to Him.
  - Allah wants that people should use their common-sense and recognize the truth through the verses of the divine Book and the signs which are scattered all over the universe and are found even in their own selves. 
  - Then, when their hearts are satisfied that the message of the Prophets contains the truth, and the beliefs and the creeds which are opposed to it, are false, they should willingly give up falsehood and adopt the truth.
  - **This voluntary belief, acceptance of the truth and rejection of falsehood, is what Allah demands from man.**
  - It is for this reason that Allah has bestowed upon man choice and free will, and freedom to follow any way, right or wrong, that he pleases.
  - For the same reason He has placed in his nature both the tendencies, towards good and towards evil, and opened up before him both the ways, to piety and to sin.
  - For the same purpose He has given Satan the freedom and respite to mislead him and has made arrangements of Prophethood, revelation and invitation to goodness to guide him to the right way, and has placed man on trial to see whether he adopts the way of belief and obedience or of disbelief and sin.
  - On the other hand, if Allah had adopted a method of coercing people to believe and obey, it would have defeated the very purpose of the trial and test. Then there was no need to send down the signs for the purpose, but He would have created man with a pure nature, without any inclination for evil, disbelief and sin, and made him obedient by birth like the angels.
  - This has been referred at several places in the Quran, for instance in (Surah Younus, Ayat 99): **Had your Lord willed, all the dwellers of the earth would have believed in Him.** And in (Surah Houd, Ayat 118): **Your Lord could have made mankind one community had He so willed, but now they will continue to follow different ways, but only those on whom Allah has His mercy (escape wrong ways). It will be so because He has created them for this (very freedom of choice and action).** For further explanation, see(E.Ns 101,102 of Surah Younus) and( E.N. 116 of Surah Houd).


## Ayat 05

- `Never does there come to them an admonition from the Merciful Lord but they turn away from it.`

## Ayat 06

- `They will soon come to know the truth of that which they have been scoffing at.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the people who show lack of feeling and interest for every rational attempt made to bring them to the right way, cannot be made to believe forcibly by sending down signs from heaven.
  - They only deserve to be shown their evil end after they have been duly warned and shown guidance, which they not only treated with indifference but rejected scornfully.
  - This evil end can be shown to them in several ways.

## Ayat 07

- `Do they not look at the earth, how We caused a variety of fine vegetation to grow from it (in abundance)?`

## Ayat 08 

- `Surely there is a Sign in this,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the seeker after truth does not have to look far for a sign. If only he sees with open eyes the phenomena of vegetation around him, he will be able to judge for himself whether the reality about the system of the world (i.e. Tauhid) which was being presented by the Prophets is true or the speculations of the polytheists and atheists.
    - From the variety and abundance of creation found on the earth, the various elements and factors supporting it, the laws of nature causing it to grow and flourish, and the accord and harmony existing between its characteristics and the countless needs and demands of innumerable creatures, only a fool will conclude that all this is happening automatically without the wisdom, knowledge, power and design of an All-Mighty, All-Powerful Creator.
    - Obviously, many masters and gods could not have by any device arranged and produced the perfect harmony and accord between the soil, the sun and the moon, and the animal and plant life produced with their help and the needs of a great variety of creatures living on the earth.
    - A sensible person, unless he is prejudiced and biased, cannot help feeling convinced that these are the clear signs and proofs of the existence of One God, and there is no further need of a miracle to convince him of the reality of Tauhid.
- `but most of them would not believe.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, He has the power and ability to annihilate completely anyone whom He wills to punish, but it is His mercy that He does not hasten to punish the wrong-doer, but gives him respite for years and centuries to allow him time to think, understand and mend his ways, and is ever ready to forgive the sins of a lifetime if the sinner offers repentance but once.


## Ayat 09

- `Verily Your Lord is Infinitely Mighty, Most Compassionate.`
