**Ayat  55 - 76**

## Ayat 55

- `From this very earth We created you and to the same earth We shall cause you to return, and from it We shall bring you forth to life again.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, every man has to pass through three stages:
    1. From birth to death.
    2. From death to Resurrection
    3. From the Day of Resurrection to Eternity.
 - According to this verse, all the three stages will take place on this earth.

## Ayat 56

- `Indeed We showed Pharaoh Our Signs,`
- `all of them,`
- `but he declared them to be false and rejected them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Signs” comprised those arguments which were based on natural phenomena and human life and those miracles which were given to Prophet Moses (peace be upon him).
  - These arguments are contained in the speeches of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) which he delivered before Pharaoh, and the miracles which he showed and are mentioned at several places in the Quran.

## Ayat 57

- `He said:`
  - `"Have you come to us to drive us out of our land by your sorcery?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here by sorcery are meant the miracles of the staff and the shining hand, which according to the details given in Surahs Al-Aaraf and Ash-Shuara, were shown to Pharaoh by Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) in his first visit to his court.
  - On seeing these miracles Pharaoh was so upset that he cried out: Have you come to drive us out of our country by the power of your sorcery?
  - Although he knew that it had never happened in history that a magician had conquered a country by the power of sorcery. Moreover, there were hundreds of magicians in his own country, who used to show their feats to earn rewards and prizes. Accordingly, Pharaoh’s statement that **“you are a sorcerer”** on the one hand, and his apprehension that **“you want to snatch my kingdom”** on the other, were a clear indication of his perturbed mind.
  - In fact, Pharaoh had come to understand that the well reasoned speech of Moses and his miracles were bound to influence not only his courtiers, but also the common people and accordingly he tried to play upon their prejudices through falsehood and treachery.
  - He did not admit that it was a miracle, but called it sorcery. He wanted to create an impression that any sorcerer of his empire could turn a staff into a serpent. He also incited the people, saying: Look, he says that your forefathers were on the wrong way and deserved perdition. So beware of him, he is not a Prophet. He simply aspires for power. He wants that the Israelites should again capture power here like the times of Joseph and wrest the reigns of government from the Copts. Pharaoh, in fact, wanted to suppress the invitation to the truth through such devices. For details please see (E.Ns 87-89 of Surah Al-Aaraf);(E.N. 75 of Surah Younus).

## Ayat 58

- `We shall confront you with a sorcery like your own.`
- `So appoint a day when both of us might meet face to face in an open space;`
- `an appointment which neither we nor you shall fail to keep."`

## Ayat 59

- `Moses said:`
  - `"The appointment to meet you is on the Day of the Feast and let all people come together before noon."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The object of Pharaoh was this: Once the sorcerers are able to transform the staffs and ropes into serpents, the entire effect of the miracle performed by Moses (peace be upon him) would disappear from the people’s minds.
  - That was exactly to Moses’ (peace be upon him) advantage, who suggested that it was no good fixing an ordinary day or place for the purpose.
  - The Day of the Feast was at hand. People would flock on that occasion from all corners of the empire. Therefore, the encounter should be held in the open so that all might witness it, and in the day time so that everyone should be able to see it clearly.


## Ayat 60

- `Pharaoh went back and concerted all his stratagem and returned for the encounter.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Pharaoh and his courtiers considered the coming encounter as a decisive one as far as their own future was concerned and, therefore, they attached the utmost importance to it.
  - Courtiers were sent throughout the country to muster round all the magicians wherever available.
  - People were especially encouraged to come in the largest numbers to witness the magic skills so as to keep them immune from the awe inspired by the staff of Moses (peace be upon him).
  - It was openly said that the fate of their religion hinged on the skill of their magicians. Their religion could survive only if they won, otherwise the religion of Moses (peace be upon him) would have its sway see (Surah Ash-Shuara, Ayat 34-51).

## Ayat 61

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The adversaries whom Prophet Moses addressed were Pharaoh and his courtiers who had dubbed him as a sorcerer, and not the common people, who had yet to see the encounter between him and the magicians.


- `(At the time of the encounter) Moses said to them:`
  - `"Woe to you! Do not invent falsehoods against Allah2 lest He destroy you with a scourge. Surely those who invent lies shall come to grief."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The inventing of lie was that they had dubbed Allah’s Messenger as a sorcerer and his miracles as a piece of sorcery.

## Ayat 62

- `Thereupon they wrangled among themselves about the matter and conferred in secret.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This shows that those people felt in their hearts that their position was weak and knew that the miracle shown by Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) was not a piece of magic.
  - Therefore, they had come for the encounter with hesitation and fear. But when the timely, sudden warning of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) shook them to the core, they began to debate the wisdom of holding the encounter on the Feast Day in an open place in the broad day light. For they thought that if they were defeated in the presence of the common people, all would come to know of the difference between magic and a miracle and they would lose the battle once for all.

## Ayat 63


- `Some of them said:`
  - `"These two are magicians, who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and to destroy your excellent way of life.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Those who were of this view must have been a few fanatics of Pharaoh’s party who were prepared to go to any extent to oppose Prophet Moses (peace be upon him).
  - Those people must have been preparing the public for a determined encounter, while the reasonable people among them must have been advising caution and restraint.


## Ayat 64

- `So muster all your stratagem and come forth in a row.1`
- `Whoever prevails today shall triumph."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - They also urged them to present a united front and not to show their differences on the very occasion of the encounter. For, they argued, any hesitation and secret consultation before the very eyes of the public would show that they did not consider themselves to be in the right.


## Ayat 65

- `The magicians1 said:`
  - `"Moses, will you throw down or shall we be the first to throw?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That confidence was subsequently restored among Pharaoh’s party by the speech of the head-strong people, and the magicians were asked to come into the field for the encounter.

## Ayat 66

- `Moses replied:`
  - `"No, let it be you to throw first."`
- `Then suddenly it appeared to Moses, owing to their magic,1as if their ropes and staffs were running.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 116), it was stated: When they threw down their devices they bewitched the eyes of the people and filled their hearts with terror.
  - Here it is stated that it was not the common people alone who were terrified by their magic but Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) also suffered from its effect.
  - He not only seemed to see that the staffs and cords were running about like serpents but he also felt a dread of them.

## Ayat 67

- `So Moses' heart was filled with fear.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It appears that no sooner did Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) say: Cast down, the magicians immediately cast their staffs and cords and it seemed as if hundreds of serpents were running towards him, and he instinctively felt a dread of them.
  - And there is nothing strange in this because a Prophet is after all a human being. 
  - Besides this, it is also possible that Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) apprehended that the demonstration of the magic might create a misunderstanding among the people about his miracle.
  - This is also a proof that a Prophet too can be influenced by magic to a certain extent like the common people, though magicians have no power to produce any effect on his Prophethood or interfere with revelation, or misguide him.
  - Therefore there is no reason why one should consider as false those traditions in which it has been stated that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) suffered temporarily from the effect of magic.

## Ayat 68

- `We said to him:`
  - `"Have no fear; for it is you who will prevail.`

## Ayat 69

- `And throw down what is in your right hand;`
- `it will swallow up all that they have wrought.`
- `They have wrought only a magician's stratagem.`
- `A magician cannot come to any good, come whence he may."`

## Ayat 70

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - When they saw the power of the staff of Moses (peace be upon him), they involuntarily fell prostrate as if someone had made them do so, because they were convinced that it was a miracle and not a feat of magic.


- `Eventually the magicians were impelled to fall down prostrate and said:`
  - **`"We believe in the Lord of Moses and Aaron."`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This profession of faith by the magicians shows that everyone was aware of the basic object of the encounter.
  - It was not an encounter between the feats of the magicians and those of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him), but it was to decide whether the claim of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) that he was a Messenger of Allah was true or not.
  - If this staff was actually turned into a dragon, it was by means of a miracle. On the other hand, Pharaoh intended to prove by the feats of his magicians that it was not a miracle but a feat of magic.
  - Incidentally, this also shows that Pharaoh and his magicians and the common people fully understood the distinction between a miracle and a feat of magic.
  - That is why when the magicians saw that it was a miracle shown by the power of Allah which had exposed their magic, they did not say that Moses (peace be upon him) was a more skillful magician, but straightway fell prostrate, saying: We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.


## Ayat 71

- `Pharaoh said:`
  - `"What! Did you believe in Him even before I permitted you to do so?`
  - `Surely, he must be your chief who taught you magic.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - In( Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat, 123), it has been stated: Indeed it was a plot you conspired in the city to deprive the rightful owners of their power. Here the same thing has been further explained, as if to say: It is not merely a plot between you and him but it appears that Moses is your master and leader.
      - You conspired beforehand that you would be defeated by your master in the encounter to prove that he was a Messenger who had shown the miracle of the staff to frustrate your magic and bring about a political revolution in the country.
  - `Now I will certainly cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, right hand and left foot or vice versa.
  - `and will crucify you on the trunks of palm-trees,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This was a very cruel way of punishment in ancient times. They fixed a long pole in the ground or used the trunk of a tree for this purpose. Then a piece of wood was tied across it at the top. Then the hands of the criminal were nailed on to it and he was left hanging there for hours to die a slow, painful death.
  - `and then you will come to know which of us can inflict sterner and more lasting torment."`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This was the last trick played by Pharaoh to win the losing game.
      - He held out the threat of a cruel punishment in order to coerce them to admit that there really was a conspiracy between Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) and them against the kingdom.
      - But the fortitude and determination of the magicians turned the tables on him. 
      - The very fact that, they were ready to endure the terrible punishment proved to the world that they had sincerely believed in the Prophethood of Moses (peace be upon him) and that the charge of conspiracy was an impudent trick that had been invented as a device.

## Ayat 72

- `The magicians answered:`
  - `"By Him Who has created us, we shall never prefer you to the Truth after manifest Signs have come to us.`
  - `So decree whatever you will.`
  - `Your decree will pertain, at the most, to the present life of the world.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It may also be interpreted like this: It cannot be that we should prefer you to these plain signs which have come before us and to that Being Who has created us.

## Ayat 73

- **`We believe in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and also forgive us the practice of magic to which you had compelled us.`**
- **`Allah is the Best and He alone will abide."`**

## Ayat 74

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is a saying of Allah, which has been added to the foregoing words of the magicians.

- `The truth is that Hell awaits him who comes to his Lord laden with sin;`
- `he shall neither die in it nor live.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the most terrible of all the punishments that have been mentioned in the Quran. The criminal will prefer death to the horrible life in Hell, but death will not come to him. He will remain in that state of agony without any hope of relief from it.

## Ayat 75

- `But he who comes to Him with faith and righteous works shall be exalted to high ranks,`

## Ayat 76

- `and shall live for ever in everlasting Gardens beneath which rivers flow.`
- **`Such will be the reward of those who purify themselves.`**
