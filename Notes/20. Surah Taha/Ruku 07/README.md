**Ayat  116 - 128**

## Ayat 116

- `Recall when We said to the angels:`
  - `"Prostrate yourselves before Adam";`
  - `all prostrated themselves save Iblis.`
  - `He refused.`


## Ayat 117

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here the command, which was given to Prophet Adam, has not been mentioned, which was: You must not eat the fruit of this tree. This has been mentioned at other places but has been omitted here because the emphasis here is on this weakness of man that he is easily seduced by Satan in spite of the forewarnings and admonitions to this effect.

- `Then We said: "Adam!`
- `He is an enemy to you and to your wife.`
- `So let him not drive both of you out of Paradise and plunge you into affliction,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This was to forewarn both of them of the consequences of disobedience of the command.

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Both knew that Satan was their enemy, for Adam himself had witnessed the demonstration of his enmity, when he had refused to bow down before him and declared in plain words:
    - **I am better than him**.
    - **You created me of fire and him of clay.**
      - (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 12);(Surah Suad, Ayat 76), see also(Surah Al-Hijr, Ayat 33). 
    - Should I bow before the one whom You created out of clay. And then added:
    - **Just consider was he worthy of this that You have exalted him over me.** 
      - (Surah Al-Isra, Ayats 61-62).
    - Then Satan did not rest content with this bragging of superiority but evinced his jealousy by giving an open challenge that he would prove it by seducing Adam.
      - (Surah Al_Aaraf, Ayats 16, 17); (Surah Al-Hijr, Ayats 36-42); (Surah Al-Isra, Ayats 62-66); (Surah Suad, Ayats 82-83).

## Ayat 118

- `(for in Paradise) neither are you hungry nor naked,`

## Ayat 119

- `nor face thirst or scorching heat."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the explanation of the distress which they had to undergo immediately after their expulsion from the Garden.
  - Here instead of mentioning the high and perfect blessings of the Garden, only four basic necessities of life have been stated, namely,
    1. food,
    2. drink,
    3. dress,
    4. shelter,
  - as if to say: In the Garden you are being supplied with all these necessities without any labor from you. But if you succumb to the temptations and seduction of Satan, you will be totally deprived not only of these facilities but also of the higher blessings of the Garden.
  - In that case, you will have to work so hard for these necessities that very little energy and time and leisure will be left with you to strive for higher aims of life.

## Ayat 120

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - According to this verse, it was Adam whom Satan primarily wanted to seduce and not Eve.
  - Though according to (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 20), he tempted both of them and both were seduced, but Satan’s efforts were mainly directed to Adam.
  - On the contrary, according to the Bible, the serpent first tempted the woman to eat the fruit of the forbidden tree and then she seduced her husband. (Genesis, 3).


- `But Satan seduced him, saying:`
  - `"Adam! Shall I direct you to a tree of eternal life and an abiding kingdom?"`

- My thoughts: Does that mean, Hazrat Adam AS. in heaven did not have eternal life? I do not know or understood this properly though.

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - According to this verse, Satan tempted Adam to eat the fruit of the tree so that he might get eternal life and everlasting kingdom, and according to (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 20), he put an additional temptation in their way, saying that they would become angels and immortal.


## Ayat 121

- `Then the two of them ate the fruit of that tree and their shameful parts became revealed to each other, and they began to cover themselves with the leaves from the Garden.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - No sooner did they disobey the command, they were deprived of all the facilities, but naturally the immediate effect of this as felt by them was that they were stripped of their garments.
    - Then gradually, as they felt thirsty, hungry etc. they realized that they had been deprived of all the facilities that they enjoyed in the Garden.
- `Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord and strayed into error.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It is worth while to understand the nature of human weakness which helped Satan to seduce Adam and Eve.
    - They succumbed to seduction because Satan tempted them in the garb of a true friend and well-wisher even though they knew well that he was their enemy.
    - For, Adam had a direct knowledge of the envy and enmity of Satan, who had challenged to seduce and ruin him in his very presence.
    - Allah had also warned them to guard against the envy of and the temptations by Satan and had informed them of the consequences of disobedience.
    - Above all, Adam and Eve still believed in Allah and never thought of intentional disobedience.
    - But in spite of this, when Satan tempted them in the garb of a friend, they disobeyed their Lord: they forgot the command for the time being for lack of fineness of purpose. And since then this human weakness has persisted in their descendants during all ages.


## Ayat 122

- `Thereafter his Lord exalted him,`
- `accepted his repentance,`
- `and bestowed guidance upon him,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **“His Lord chose him”** because he did not disobey Him intentionally and did not persist in sin arrogantly.
    - As soon as he realized his error, he felt ashamed of it and asked Allah’s pardon: **O our Lord, we have wronged ourselves gravely. If You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we shall be totally ruined.** (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 23).
    - In contrast to Adam and Eve, Satan was cursed because he not only disobeyed his Lord but also persisted in his sin, and boldly challenged Him that it was He Who was responsible for his disobedience, for He had preferred Adam whom He had created of clay over him whom He had made of fire.

## Ayat 123

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, Allah not only pardoned him but also gave him guidance and taught him the way to follow it.

- `and said:`
  - `"Get down, both of you, (that is, man and Satan),`
  - `and be out of it;`
  - `each of you shall be an enemy to the other.`
  - **`Henceforth if there comes to you a guidance from Me, then whosoever follows My guidance shall neither go astray nor suffer misery.`**

## Ayat 124

- `But whosoever turns away from this Admonition from Me shall have a straitened life;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “A life of hardship” does not mean a life of poverty.
    - It means that such a one shall be deprived of the peace of mind, even though he may be a millionaire or the ruler of a vast empire. 
    - For, the one who will turn away from the admonition will win all the worldly successes by unlawful means and, therefore, will always be suffering from pangs of a guilty conscience and deprived of the peace of mind and real happiness.
- `We shall raise him blind on the Day of Resurrection,"`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here the story of Prophet Adam (peace be upon him) ends.
  - In the light of this part of the story which has been related here and at other places in the Quran, I have come to the conclusion (and correct knowledge is with Allah alone) that the vicegerency of the earth was the same as was initially bestowed on Adam in the Garden, which might have been created in the heavens or on this earth.
  - Anyhow the vicegerent of Allah was supplied gratis with all the necessities of life and the angels were placed under his command for service. This was to enable him to discharge the high and noble obligations of vicegerency, without any worry about the procurement of the necessities of life.
  - But in order to make him permanent in this office, it was necessary to put him to a test so that all his capabilities, excellences and weaknesses might be known. Accordingly, he had to take his test in which some of his weaknesses came to the surface. He was prone to be seduced by greed and temptation. He did not remain firm in obedience. He was capable of forgetfulness. That is why he was given the vicegerency as a trial on the earth for a fixed term up to the Day of Judgment.
  - During this period of trial, he had himself to make arrangements for the necessities of life though he was allowed to exploit all the resources of the earth and to rule over other creatures.
  - The trial is this: does he or does he not obey his Lord in spite of having the power to obey or not to obey. And if he forgets or is seduced by greed, does he or does he not repent through warning and admonition, when he realizes his error.
  - At the same time, his Lord has warned him that a full and perfect record of all his deeds and misdeeds is being kept, and that he shall be judged on the Day of Reckoning in accordance with it.
  - Those who will come out successful will be given permanent vicegerency and that eternal life and everlasting kingdom by which Satan seduced him.
  - The righteous servants will become the heirs to the Garden, if they had obeyed their Lord or repented after forgetfulness.
  - It should also be noted well that life in the Garden will not merely be to eat, drink and be merry, but there will be such higher things to achieve as no human being can conceive in this world.
  - That is why only those blessings of the Garden have been mentioned in the Quran which can be comprehended by human beings in this world.

## Ayat 125

- `where-upon he will say:`
  - `"Lord! Why have You raised me blind when I had sight in the world?"`

## Ayat 126

- `He will say:`
  - `"Even so it is.`
  - `Our Signs came to you and you ignored them.`
  - `So shall you be ignored this Day."`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Quran has described the different conditions and experiences through which the criminals will pass from the Day of Resurrection to the time of their entry into Hell:
  - **You were neglectful of this, now We have removed the curtain from before you and your sight has become very sharp.**
    - (Surah Qaaf, Ayat 22).
  - **He is only deferring them to the Day when all eyes shall stare with consternation. They will be running in terror with heads uplifted and eyes fixed upwards and hearts void.**
    - (Surah Ibrahim, Ayats 42-43).
  - **We have fastened the augury of every man to his own neck and on the Day of Resurrection We will bring forth a writing which he will find like an open book. (It will be said to him:) Here is your record: read it. Today you can yourself reckon your account.**
    - (Surah Al-Isra, Ayats 13-14).
  - In the light of the above and this (verse 126), it appears that in the Hereafter, the criminals shall be enabled to see the horrible sights and to realize the consequences of their evil deeds, but in other respects they will be like the blind man who cannot see his way and is deprived of even a staff to feel his way, nor is there anyone to guide him. So he stumbles and is knocked about and does not know where to go and how to satisfy his needs.
  - This very state has been expressed thus: *You forgot Our Revelations when they came to you, so you are being forgotten today, as if, you were blind and had no one to look after you.*

## Ayat 127

- `Thus do We requite him who transgresses and does not believe in the signs of your Lord (during the life of the world);`
- `and surely the punishment of the Hereafter is even more terrible and more enduring.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This refers to the wretched life which will be the lot of those who turn away from the admonition in this worldly life.

## Ayat 128

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “For them”: means people of Makkah.

- `Did they not find any guidance in the fact that We destroyed many nations in whose ruined dwelling-places they now walk about?`
- `Surely there are many Signs in them for people endowed with wisdom.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, in this lesson of history and in the observation of the archaeological remains and in this experience of mankind.
