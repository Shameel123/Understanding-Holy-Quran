**Ayat  129 - 135**

## Ayat 129

- `Were it not for a word already gone from your Lord,`
- `the decree (of their destruction) would have come to pass.`

## Ayat 130

- `So bear patiently with what they say.`
- `Glorify your Lord, praising Him before sunrise and before sunset, and in the watches of the night,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is to comfort and console the Prophet (peace be upon him), as if to say: Allah does not intend to destroy them yet, for He has appointed for them a term of respite, so you should endure with patience whatever they do against you and hear their harsh talk and go on performing the obligations of your mission. For this purpose you should offer Salat in accordance with the prescribed times because it will create in you necessary forbearance and fortitude.
- `and glorify Him and at the ends of the day that you may attain to happiness.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **“Glorify Him”** means: Offer your prescribed Prayers, as is clear from Ayat 132.

## Ayat 131

- `Do not turn your eyes covetously towards the embellishments of worldly life that We have bestowed upon various kinds of people to test them.`
- `But the clean provision bestowed upon you by your Lord is better and more enduring.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It means: It does not behoove you and your companions to be envious of the riches of the wicked people who are amassing wealth by unlawful means.
  - The best thing for you is the lawful provision which you earn by your hard labor, even though this may be meager in quantity. That is better for the pious and righteous and is of everlasting virtue.


## Ayat 131

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, also teach your children that lawful provision is much better than the unlawful riches of the wicked people.
  - For this purpose, enjoin them to say their prescribed Prayers, for this will change their attitude, their standard of values, and make them contented with pure provisions and virtuous life in preference to the life of sin and luxury.


- `Enjoin Prayer on your household,`
- `and do keep observing it.`
- `We do not ask you for any worldly provision;`
- `rather, it is We Who provide you,`
- `and ultimately the pious will end up the best.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It implies this: We do not ask you to offer your Prayers for any benefit of Our own.
  - We ask you to do that for your own good, because this will create piety in you which will bring about true success for you in this world and in the Hereafter.

## Ayat 133

- `They ask:`
  - `"Why does he not bring us a (miraculous) sign from his Lord?"`
- `Has there not come to them a Book containing the teachings of the previous scriptures?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This means that the Quran itself is a great miracle, for though it is being presented by an unlettered person from among them, it contains the essence of the teachings and guidance of all tire previous divine Books. Not only that, it makes those teachings and guidance so plain and clear that even a simple man of the desert can benefit from them.

## Ayat 134

- `Had We destroyed them through some calamity before his coming, they would have said:`
  - `"Our Lord! Why did You not send any Messenger to us that we might have followed Your signs before being humbled and disgraced?"`

## Ayat 135

- `Tell them, (O Muhammad):`
  - `"Everyone is waiting for his end.1`
  - `Wait, then, and you will soon know who are the people of the Right Way, and are rightly-guided."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, ever since the message of Islam is being presented in your city (Makkah), it is not only every person of this city who is waiting for its ultimate result but also every one outside it, who has heard of it.
