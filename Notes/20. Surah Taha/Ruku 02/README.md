**Ayat  25 - 54**

## Ayat 25

- `Moses said: "Lord! Open my breast for me;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, fill my heart with the courage that may enable me to perform the obligations connected with the great mission of a Messenger, and give me the confidence for its fulfillment.
  - Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) prayed for this because he realized the grave responsibilities of the great mission.

## Ayat 26

- `and ease my task for me,`

## Ayat 27

- `and loosen the knot from my tongue`

## Ayat 28

- `so that they may understand my speech;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) prayed to Allah for this because he was conscious that he was not a fluent speaker but was slow of speech.
  - He also knew that as a Messenger he would have to be fluent in order to impress Pharaoh and his courtiers.
  - This is confirmed by the Bible (Exodus 4: 10) but the Talmud gives a strange explanation for this impediment in his speech. According to it, when he was a child he burnt his tongue with a live coal to escape punishment from Pharaoh whose crown he had taken off from his head and put it on his own head. The same story has been adopted by many of our commentators though it is absurd on the face of it.
  - Our interpretation is also confirmed by the Quran. The fact is, that at first he was not a fluent speaker and Pharaoh had also taunted him on this impediment. (Surah Az-Zukhruf, Ayat 52).
  - Prophet Moses realized the same for he said: My brother Aaron is more fluent than me, so send him with me as a helper, so that he may support me (with his fluent speech). (Surah Al-Qasas, Ayat 34).
  - Afterwards this impediment in his speech was removed and he was able to deliver very fluent speeches. This may be testified by his speeches which have been cited both in the Bible and in the Quran for they are masterpieces of eloquence and rhetoric.

## Ayat 29

- `and appoint for me, from my household, someone who will help me bear my burden -`

## Ayat 30

- `Aaron, my brother.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Prophet Aaron was three years older than Prophet Moses (peace be upon them). (Exodus7:7).

## Ayat 31

- `Strengthen me through him`

## Ayat 32

- `and let him share my task`

## Ayat 33

- `that we may abundantly extol Your glory;`

## Ayat 34

- `and may remember You much.`

## Ayat 35

- `Verily, You have always watched over us."`

## Ayat 36

- `He said:`
  - `"Moses, your petition is granted.`

## Ayat 37

- `We have again bestowed Our favour upon you.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Allah recounts the favors He had shown to Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) since his birth in order to impress upon him the fact that he had been brought up under divine care right from his birth for the purpose of appointing him as a Messenger. 
  - Here mere references have been made but in Surah Al-Qasas details of the favors have been given.


## Ayat 38

- `Recall, when We indicated to your mother through inspiration:`

## Ayat 39

- `'Put the baby into a chest and then throw him in the river.`
- `The river will throw him up on the shore, and then an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his will take him.'`
- `And I spread My love over you in order that you might be reared in My sight.`

## Ayat 40

- `Recall, when your sister went along, saying:`
  - `'Shall I direct you to one who will take charge of him?'`
- `Thus We brought you back to your mother so that her heart might be gladdened and she might not grieve.`
- `Moses, recall when you slew a person. We delivered you from distress and made you go through several trials.`
- `Then you stayed for several years among the people of Midian, and now you have come at the right moment as ordained.`

## Ayat 41

- `I have chosen you for My service.`

- Such a huge statement this is.. To be chosen by Allah SWT for His service...

## Ayat 42

- `So go forth, both you and your brother, with My Signs,`
- `and do not slacken in remembering Me.`

## Ayat 43

- `Go both of you to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed all bounds,`

## Ayat 44

- `and speak to him gently, perhaps he may take heed or fear (Allah)."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The only two ways of bringing a man to the right way are:
    1. To convince him by argument and admonition.
    2. To warn him of the consequences of deviation.


## Ayat 45

- `The two said:"`
  - `Lord! We fear he may commit excesses against us, or transgress all bounds."`

## Ayat 46

- `He said:`
  - `"Have no fear. I am with you, hearing and seeing all.`

## Ayat 47

- `So, go to him, and say:`
  - `'Behold, both of us are the Messengers of your Lord.`
  - `Let the Children of Israel go with us, and do not chastise them.`
  - `We have come to you with a sign from your Lord;`
  - `and peace shall be for him who follows the true guidance.`

## Ayat 48

- `It has been revealed to us that chastisement awaits those who called the lie to the truth and turned away from it.' "`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - A comparative study of this incident as given in the Bible and the Talmud will show that the Quran does not copy the stories from these books, but gives its own version in order to portray the Messengers in their true glory and dignity.
  - According to the Bible, when God said to Moses (peace be upon him) that He would send him to Pharaoh, Moses (peace be upon him) replied: Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? (Exodus 3: 11). God persuaded and encouraged Moses (peace be upon him) by giving him signs but he was still reluctant and said: O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. (Exodus 4: 13).
  - And the Talmud goes even further than this and says that there was an argument between God and Moses (peace be upon him) for seven days that he should become a Prophet but Moses (peace be upon him) did not accept the offer. At this God was angry with him and so made his brother Aaron (peace be upon him) a partner in his Prophethood. Moreover, He deprived the descendants of Moses (peace be upon him) of the office of priesthood and bestowed it on the descendants of Aaron (peace be upon him). 
  - **These two versions depict Allah to be suffering from human weaknesses and Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) from inferiority complex.**

## Ayat 49

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here the details have been omitted. These have been given in (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats: 103-108); (Surah Ash- Shuara, Ayats 10-33); (Surah Al-Qasas, Ayats 28-40); (Surah An-Naziat, Ayats 15-25).
  - As regards to the necessary information about Pharaoh, see (E.N. 85 of Surah Al-Aaraf).


- `Pharaoh1 said:" Moses! Who is the Lord of the two of you?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Pharaoh addressed Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) because he was, in regards to Prophethood, the senior of the two.
  - It is also possible that he deliberately addressed him in order to exploit his impediment in speech, and ignored Prophet Aaron (peace be upon him), who was more fluent.

## Ayat 50

- `He said:`
  - `"Our Lord is He`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, we acknowledge Him alone as our Lord in every sense. He is our Sustainer, our Maker, our Master, our Sovereign and is Supreme in everything, and there is no other lord in any sense but Him.
  - `Who gave everything its form and then guided it."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This concise sentence needs serious attention. It means that it is Allah alone Who has created everything and given it its distinctive structure, form, capabilities, characteristics, etc.

## Ayat 51

- `Pharaoh asked:`
  -  `"Then, what is the state of the former generations?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The question posed by Pharaoh was very subtle.
  - He meant to say: If there is no other lord than the One Who has given a distinctive form to everyone, then what will be the position of our forefathers who had been worshiping other deities since centuries? Were all those people in error? Did all of them deserve torment? Did they all lack common sense?
  - Thus Pharaoh perhaps wanted to give vent to his anger against Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) for showing disrespect to his forefathers.
  - At the same time he also wanted to incite his courtiers and the common people of Egypt against the message of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him).
  - And this trick has always been used against the people who propagate the truth and has always proved very effective to incite those people who lack common sense.
    - This same trick has been mentioned here for it was being employed at the very time against the Prophet (peace be upon him) by the people of Makkah.

## Ayat 52

- `Moses said:`
  - `"Its knowledge is with my Lord, recorded in the Book. My Lord does not err, nor does He forget."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This answer is full of wisdom.
  - If Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) had said:
    - Yes, they all lacked common sense and had gone astray and would become the fuel of Hell, this answer, though true, would have served the very purpose Pharaoh had in mind in putting the question.
    - But the answer given by the Prophet was true and it frustrated the trick of Pharaoh as well.
    - His answer was to this effect: Well, those people have now gone before their Lord, and I have no means of judging their deeds and intentions. However, their whole record is safe and secure with Allah, and nothing can escape Him. Allah alone knows how to deal with them.
    - What concerns you and me is our own position and attitude to life. We should be more concerned about our own end than of those who have already passed away into Allahâ€™s presence.

## Ayat 53

- `He it is Who spread the earth for you; and made in it paths for you, and sent down water from the sky, and then through it We brought forth many species of diverse plants.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It is quite obvious that (Ayats 53-55 )are an addition by Allah to the foregoing answer by Prophet Moses (peace be upon him).
  - There are other instances of this in the Quran that Allah added a few sentences to the speech of someone by way of admonition. Moreover, it is connected not only with the preceding verse but also with the whole reply of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him). (Ayats 50-52).


## Ayat 54

- `So eat yourself and pasture your cattle.`
- `Surely there are many Signs in this for people of understanding.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, those who use their common sense in their search for the truth, find a way to the reality by the help of these signs, which clearly show that the universe has One Lord Who alone is sustaining it, and there is no room here for any other lord.
