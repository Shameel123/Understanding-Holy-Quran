**Ayat  90 - 104**

## Ayat 90

- `Certainly Aaron had said to them even before (the return of Moses):`
  - `"My people, you were fallen into error because of the calf.`
  - `Surely your Lord is Most Compassionate; so follow me and obey my command."`

## Ayat 91

- `But they answered:`
  - `"By no means shall we cease to worship it until Moses returns to us."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here the Quran exonerates Prophet Aaron (peace be upon him) from the sin of taking any part in the calfworship, but in contrast to this, the Bible makes him wholly responsible for making the golden calf and setting it up as a god. According to Exodus:

## Ayat 92

- `(After rebuking his people) Moses turned to Aaron and said:`
  - `"Aaron! What prevented you, when you saw them going astray,`

## Ayat 93

- `from following my way? Have you disobeyed my command?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The “command” refers to the instructions which Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) gave to his brother Prophet Aaron (peace be upon him) when he made him his deputy in his absence when he went up to Mount Toor: After me take my place and do the right and follow not the way of the mischief-makers. (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 142).

## Ayat 94

- `Aaron answered:`
  - `"Son of my mother!`
  - `Do not seize me with my beard, nor by (the hair of) my head.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - See (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 150).
  - `I feared that on returning you might say:`
    - `'You sowed discord among the Children of Israel, and did not pay heed to my words.'"`
      - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
        - It can also be interpreted like this: You did not wait for orders from me.
        - In order to understand fully the statement of Prophet Aaron (peace be upon him), one should read this verse along with (verse 150 of Surah Al-Aaraf), where he says: Son of my mother, these people overpowered me and were going to kill me.
        - So, let not the enemies gloat over me. Do not count me among the people who have done wrong.
        - Now if both these verses are read together, one can easily see the true picture of the event.
        - Prophet Aaron (peace be upon him) did his utmost to stop the people from committing the sin of calf-worship, but they revolted against him and might even have killed him. Fearing a clash between them, therefore, he held his peace lest Prophet Moses (peace be upon him), on his return, might blame him for letting the situation worsen and failing to control it effectively in his absence.
        - The last clause of (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 150) also gives the hint that there existed among the people a good number of the enemies of the two brothers.

## Ayat 95

- `Moses said: "What, then, is your case, O Samiri?"`

## Ayat 96

- `He answered:`
  - `"I saw what the people did not see.`
  - `So I took a handful of dust from the trail of the Messenger, and I flung it (into the fire).`
  - `Thus did my mind prompt me."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here it has been a good deal of divergence of opinion in regard to the interpretation of this verse.
  - According to the majority of the early commentators and their followers, it means: The Samiri saw the Messenger (Angel Gabriel) when he was passing and took a handful of dust from his footprints. Then he sprinkled this upon the idol of the golden calf. This created life in it and it began to low like a living calf.
  - The Quran, in fact, does not say that this actually happened but merely cites the reply given by the Samiri to Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) when the latter took him to task for the great sin he had committed.


## Ayat 97

- `Moses said:`
  - `"Be gone, then.`
  - `All your life you shall cry:`
    - `'Untouchable.'`
  - `There awaits a term for your reckoning that you cannot fail to keep.`
  - `Now look at your god that you devotedly adored:`
    - `We shall burn it and scatter its remains in the sea.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The words show that he was not only made an outcast for life but was made to inform the people himself that he was an outcast, as given in Leviticus:

## Ayat 98

- `Your God is none else than Allah, beside Whom there is no god.`
- **`His knowledge embraces everything."`**

## Ayat 99

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Now that the story of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) comes to an end, the same theme, that was interrupted by this story, has been resumed.


- `(O Muhammad),`
- `thus do We recount to you the events of the past,`
- `and We have bestowed upon you from Ourself an admonition.2`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the Quran about which it was said at the beginning of the Surah that it had not been sent down to put the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) in distress, and that it was an admonition for the God-fearing.

## Ayat 100

- `He who turns away from it will surely bear a heavy burden on the Day of Resurrection,`

## Ayat 101

- `and will abide under this burden for ever.`
- `Grievous shall be the burden on the Day of Resurrection,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here the people have been warned that whoso will turn away front the Quran and will reject its guidance, he shall do harm to himself only and not to Allah and His Messenger, and that the one, who rejects His Message, shall inevitably be punished in the Hereafter.
  - And this warning holds good for every people, every country and every age. This is because there are only two alternatives for an individual or a community, whom the message of the Quran reaches.
    - They can either accept it or reject it, there is no third way.

## Ayat 102


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - As regards to the nature of the blowing of the Trumpet on the Day of Resurrection, it may be likened to the blowing of the bugle in the army to muster or disperse the soldiers.
  - It is obvious that these words and terms have been used because these are known to the people. Therefore it will be wrong to consider the Trumpet to be exactly like the bugles and trumpets of this world.


- `the Day when the Trumpet shall be sounded1 and We shall muster the sinners, their eyes turned blue with terror.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - According to some commentators, it means this: The bodies of the criminals will turn white as if no drop of blood had been left in them.

## Ayat 103

- `They shall whisper among themselves: "You stayed on the earth barely ten days."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The original text may also be interpreted to mean: After your death, you may have passed hardly ten days till now. As regards to the interpretation adopted in the translation, it is supported by (Surah Ash-Shuara, Ayats 112-113): When Allah will ask them, for how many years did you stay on the earth? They will say: We stayed there for a day or part of a day. You may ask those who have kept the record.
  - The second interpretation is supported by (Surah Ar-Room, Ayats 55-56): And on the day when Resurrection will take place, the criminals will declare under oaths: We have not remained in the state of death for more than an hour. And likewise they were deluded on the earth.
  - On the other hand, those who have been given knowledge and faith will say: According to the Book of Allah, you have remained in this state up to the Day of Resurrection, and this is the very Day of Resurrection, but you did not know of it.
  - Both the interpretations are supported by other verses of the Quran.
  - **It is clear from these that they will consider both the life on the earth and the life in the interval between death and Resurrection to be very short.** 
  - They will consider the earthly life to be very short because, against all their expectations, they will have to face the eternal life in the Hereafter which they denied in their earthly life. As they had made no preparation for this life, they will regret that they had ruined their eternal life for the sake of a few transitory pleasures of the short life they had been given on the earth. As regards to the duration of the interval between death and Resurrection, they will consider it to be very short, for they will imagine that they had been suddenly awakened by the Trumpet from their last sleep or unconsciousness in their earthly life.
  - Thus, they will not at first realize that the Trumpet was the signal for the Day of Resurrection because they had no expectation whatever that the Day of Resurrection would ever come. As a matter of fact, they used to make fun of this Day as a nonsensical thing.

## Ayat 104

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is a parenthesis that has been inserted to remove this doubt of the hearers: How has it been known today what the people will be talking in whispers on the Day of Resurrection?

- `We know well what they will say to one another:`
- `We also know that even the most cautious in his estimate will say:`
  - `"You lived in the world no more than a day."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is another parenthesis which has been inserted in answer to another objection raised by some hearer. It appears that when this Surah was being recited, someone might have raised this question as a ridicule: Where will these high mountains go on the Day of Resurrection, for it appears from your description of Resurrection that all the people of the world will be running about in a level plain? In order to understand the background of the question, it should be kept in mind that Makkah, where this Surah was first recited on the occasion of its revelation, is surrounded on all sides by high mountains. The answer to this question follows immediately: Allah will reduce them to fine dust and scatter it away.
