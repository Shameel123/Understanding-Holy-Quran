**Ayat  105 - 104**


## Ayat 105

- `They ask you concerning the mountains:`
  - `"Where will they go?"`
- `Say: "My Lord will scatter them like dust,`

## Ayat 106

- `and leave the earth a levelled plain`

## Ayat 107

- `in which you shall find no crookedness or curvature.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - According to the Quran, the earth will take a new shape in the Hereafter:

## Ayat 108

- `On that Day people shall follow straight on to the call of the summoner, no one daring to show any haughtiness. Their voices shall be hushed before the Most Compassionate Lord, so that you will hear nothing but a whispering murmur.1`

## Ayat 109

- `On that Day people shall follow straight on to the call of the summoner, no one daring to show any haughtiness.`
- `Their voices shall be hushed before the Most Compassionate Lord, so that you will hear nothing but a whispering murmur.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The original Arabic word hams is used for the sound of footsteps, the sound of whispering and other low sounds.
  - What it implies here is that the people will be so awestricken on that Day that there will be no sound other than that of footsteps and whispering.

## Ayat 109

- `On that Day intercession shall not avail save of him whom the Most Compassionate Lord permits,`
- `and whose word of intercession is pleasing to Him.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This also has another interpretation: On that Day intercession will not be effective except in the case of the one for whom the Merciful may allow it and be pleased to hear it for him. Both these interpretations are supported by the following:


## Ayat 110

- `He knows all that is ahead of them and all that is behind them, while the others do not know.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here the reasons for the restrictions on intercession have been stated.
  - On the one hand, no angel, no prophet, no saint, nor anyone else knows, nor can know, the full details about the records of others.
  - On the other hand, Allah has full knowledge of all the deeds and misdeeds of everyone and He knows who deserves pardon or punishment, and how much.
  - If, therefore, there had been full freedom for intercession, the whole purpose of the creation of man would have become meaningless.
  - According to this verse, the door against intercession has not been entirely closed. 
  - The righteous people will be allowed to show their sympathy for other human beings as they did in the world, but they will have to get permission for this beforehand and even then make only a right sort of recommendation.


## Ayat 111

- `All faces shall be humbled before the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting Lord,`
- `and he who bears the burden of iniquity will have failed;`

## Ayat 112

- `but whosoever does righteous works, being a believer, shall have no fear of suffering wrong or loss."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - From this, it is clear that in the Hereafter the case of every individual will be decided on merits.
    - If a man had been guilty of iniquity and injustice in regard to the rights of God or the rights of man or even his own rights, he shall be dealt with accordingly.
    - On the other hand, those, who are both believers and workers of righteous deeds, shall have no fear that they would be deprived of their rights or punished even though they were innocent.

## Ayat 113

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This means that the Quran is full of such high themes, wise teachings and admonitions as are contained in the preceding portion of this Surah as well as in the other Surahs of the Book.

- `(O Muhammad),`
- `thus have We revealed this as an Arabic Qur'an`
- `and have expounded in it warning in diverse ways`
- `so that they may avoid evil or become heedful.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the Arabic Quran might awaken them from their heedlessness and they might recollect the forgotten lessons and feel that they are going astray and might realize the consequences thereof.

## Ayat 114

  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Such sentences as this are usually found in the Quran at the end of a discourse so that it may end with the praise of Allah.
    - It is plain from the context that the discourse ends with “the Sovereign.”

- **`Exalted is Allah, the True King!`**
- `Hasten not with reciting the Qur'an before its revelation to you is finished, and pray:`
  - **`"Lord! Increase me in knowledge."`**

 - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - At the end of the discourse, the angel cautions the Prophet (peace be upon him) by Allah’s command to guard against a thing that had been noticed during the revelation, for it was not considered appropriate to do so during its recital.
    - It is obvious from the wording of the caution that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was trying to learn the revealed discourse and was repeating it during its recital by the angel. Naturally this might have diverted his attention over and over again from listening to and grasping the revelation.
    - Therefore it was felt necessary that he should be taught the right method of the receipt of the message of revelation and be asked not to try to commit it to memory during the revelation.


## Ayat 115

- `Most certainly We had given Adam a command before, but he forgot. We found him lacking in firmness of resolution.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - From here begins a new discourse, which probably was revealed some time after the preceding discourse see (E.N. 90),
  - and it was incorporated in this Surah by the command of Allah because both deal with the same theme.
  - The following are the similarities between the two:
    1. Both the discourses remind mankind of the forgotten lesson, the admonition, which Allah had taught man on the occasion of his creation.
    2. **Both teach that it is Satan who seduces man to forget that lesson.** He succeeded in this by causing his first parents to forget it. Since then he has been forgetting it over and over again and, therefore, has been cautioned against this.
