**Ayat  77 - 89**

## Ayat 77

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here the details of the events which happened during the long period of Prophet Moses’(peace be upon him) stay in Egypt have been omitted.
  - For these please see(Surah Al- Aaraf, Ayat 130-147), (Surah Younus, Ayats 83-92); (Surah Al-Momin, Ayats 23-50) and (Surah Az-Zukhuruf 46-56).

- `Most certainly We revealed to Moses:`
  - `"Proceed with My servants in the night and strike for them a dry path in the sea.`
  - `Have no fear of being overtaken, nor be afraid of treading through the sea."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This happened when God at last appointed a night for the exodus of the Israelites and the other Muslims from Egypt. They were asked to gather at a fixed place and set forth as a caravan.
  - Just at the time when they reached the coast of the Red Sea from where they had to cross to the Sinai Peninsula, Pharaoh arrived there with a large army in their pursuit.
  - We learn from (Surah Ash-Shuara, Ayats 61-63) that when they were literally between the army and the deep sea, Allah commanded Moses (peace be upon him) to smite the sea with his staff and according to this verse the sea split and stood like two high walls on both sides, leaving a dry path between them for the caravan to pass.
  - Thus, it is quite clear and plain that it was a miracle, and not the result of a wind storm or tide, for when the water rises in this way it does not remain standing like two high walls, leaving a dry path between them. 
  - For details see (E.N. 47 of Surah Ash-Shuara).

## Ayat 78

- `Pharaoh pursued them with his hosts, but they were fully overwhelmed by the sea.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - According to( Surah Ash-Shuara, Ayats 64-66), Pharaoh with his hosts followed the caravan on the dry path and they all were drowned.
  - In Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 50, it has been stated that the Israelites had reached the other shore and saw them drowning in the sea.
  - From (Surah Younus, Ayats 90-92), we learn that Pharaoh professed to believe in God while he was drowning but this was rejected by God and he was told that his dead body would he preserved for the coming generations to serve as a lesson for them.

## Ayat 79

- `Pharaoh led his people astray;`
- `he did not guide them aright.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This was a subtle warning to the disbelievers of Makkah, as if to say: Your chiefs and leaders are leading you on the same way on which Pharaoh led his people.
  - Now you can see yourselves that he did not guide them aright.

## Ayat 80

- `Children of Israel!`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The part of the story relating to their journey from the Red Sea to the foot of Mount Toor has been omitted.
    - This has already been given in(Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 138-147).
    - It has also been stated there that the Israelites said to Moses: O Moses, make a god for us like the gods these people have. See(Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 138 and its E.N. 98).
- `We saved you from your enemy and made a covenant with you on the right side of the Mount`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, on the eastern side of Toor.
    - According to(Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 51) and (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 142), Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) and the chiefs of the Israelites were summoned to Mount Toor for receiving the divine commandments on stone tablets for the guidance of the people. See (E.N. 71 of Surah Al-Baqarah).
- `and sent down on you manna and quails,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - For details please see (E.N. 73 of Surah Al-Baqarah )and (E.N. 119 of Surah Al-Aaraf). According to the Bible, manna and salva started being provided to the Israelites when they were passing through the wilderness between Elim and Sinai. 
    - According to Exodus, manna and salva were sent down thus.

## Ayat 81

- `saying:`
  - `"Partake of the good things that We have provided for you,`
  - `but do not transgress lest My wrath fall upon you;`
  - `for he upon whom My wrath falls is ruined.`

## Ayat 82

- `But I am indeed Most Forgiving to him who`
  1. `repents and`
  2. `believes and`
  3. `does righteous works and`
  4. `keeps to the Right Way."`

## Ayat 83

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - From here the same account is resumed that was interrupted by the parenthesis (Ayats 81-82).
  - The Israelites were told to stay on the right side of Mount Toor, and they would be given the commandments after forty days.

- `"But, O Moses, what has made you come in haste from your people?"`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This shows that in his eagerness to see his Lord as soon as possible, Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) had left them in the way and reached the meeting place alone.
  - For the details of that meeting the reader should see (Surah Al- Aaraf, Ayats 143-145).
  - Here only that portion has been mentioned which is connected with the calf-worship by the Israelites.
  - This has been stated here to bring home to the disbelievers of Makkah how idol-worship starts and how deeply a Prophet of Allah is concerned about this evil.

## Ayat 84

- `He said:`
  - **`"They are close behind me, and I hastened to You, Lord, that You may be pleased with me."`**

## Ayat 85

- `Said He:`
  - `"Verily We tested your people in your absence and the Samiri led them astray."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It is obvious from the last Arabic letter ‘ya’ that Samiri was not the proper name of the person, for this Arabic letter is always added to show a person’s connection with his race or clan or place.
  - Moreover, the prefix al (definite article ‘the’) in the original Arabic text clearly denotes that the Samiri was a particular man from among many other persons of the same race or clan or place, who had propagated the worship of the golden calf.
  - In fact, this does not require any further explanation than this, but this has been necessitated because many Christian missionaries and the Western Orientalists have tried to criticize the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Quran on this account.
  - They say, (God forbid,) "This is a proof of the grievous ignorance of history on the part of Muhammad (peace be upon him), the author of the Quran, and is one of the anachronisms of the Quran. They base this absurd criticism on the assumption that this Samiri was the inhabitant of Samaria, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Israel, which was built in 925 B.C. long after this happening; then centuries after this, a generation of the Samaritans came into existence as a result of inter-marriage between the Israelites and the non-Israelites. As the Samaritans worshiped the golden calf, the critics accuse the Prophet (peace be upon him) of inventing this story on the basis of mere hearsay. They say that the Prophet (peace be upon him) might have heard something like this from the neighboring Jews and inserted it in the Quran. That is not all. They also criticize that Haman who was a courtier of Cyrus has been mentioned in the Quran as a minister of Pharaoh.
  - It is a pity that these so called scholars seem to think that in the ancient times there used to be only one person bearing one name in a clan or a place, and there was absolutely no possibility of another person or persons having the same name. They do not know, or pretend they do not know, that during the time of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him), a famous people known as the Sumerians inhabited Iraq and the neighboring regions, and it is just possible that during the time of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) there were some people known as the Samiris who might have migrated to Egypt from Iraq. 
  - Besides this, according to the Bible (1 Kings, 16: 24), Samaria itself was built on a hill which was bought from Shemer and named Samaria after him. This is a clear proof that there were people named Shemer (or Sumer) even before Samaria came into existence and it is also just possible that some clans might have been called Samiri

## Ayat 86

- `Moses returned to his people full of wrath and grief, and said:`
  - `"My people! Has your Lord not made good an excellent promise He made to you?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, did not Allah fulfill the promises He made with you of showing His favors to you? For instance, He safely brought you out of Egypt and not only freed you from the slavery of your enemy but also destroyed him totally.
      - He provided you with provisions in the desert and in the mountainous regions.
      - It may also be translated like this: Did not Allah make a good promise with you? In that case, it will mean: He made a promise that he will give you the law and guidance. Was this not a good promise for your well being and betterment?
  - `And has a long time passed since those promises were fulfilled?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, had a long time passed since those great favors were done to you that you forgot them?
      - Had long ages passed since you were afflicted with persecution by your enemy that you committed such a blasphemy?
      - It may also be translated like this: Had you to wait for a long time for the fulfillment of God’s promise that you became so impatient? In that case, the meaning is obvious: You had not to wait for a long time to see the fulfillment of the promise of guidance. Therefore there was no excuse for what you did.
  - `Or was it to incur the wrath of your Lord that you broke your promise with me?"`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This covenant was the one which every community makes with its Prophet and promises that it will steadfastly follow the guidance brought by him and will not worship anyone except Allah.

## Ayat 87

- `They answered:`
  - `"We did not break our promise with you out of our own volition;`
  - `but we were laden with the load of people's ornaments,`
  - `and we simply threw them down1(into the fire),`
  - `and2 the Samiri also threw down something,`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This excuse was put forward by those people who were involved in the shirk fabricated by the Samiri.
  - They meant to say: We did not throw down the ornaments with the intention of setting up a calf nor did we know what was going to be made of these, but when the calf was brought before us, we involuntarily got involved in shirk.
  - The Arabic text which we have translated into: “We were laden with burdens of ornaments of the people”, simply means this: The heavy ornaments which our men and women were wearing like the Egyptians proved very burdensome to us in our wanderings in the desert and we did not know how to get rid of them for it appeared very difficult for us to travel in the desert with them.
  - But according to the Bible these ornaments had been borrowed by every family of the Israelites from their Egyptian neighbors with this intention, “....and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters and ye shall spoil the Egyptians....and let every man borrow of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold....And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians....so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.” And that, too, on the advice of Prophet Moses, whom God Himself had instructed to do this noble deed. (Exodus, 3: 14-22, 11: 2-3, and I 2: 35-36).
  - It is a pity that some of our commentators have interpreted this verse in the light of the above traditions of the Bible.
  - They say that the Israelites felt burdened with the weight of those ornaments which they had borrowed from their Egyptian neighbors, with the intention of carrying them away as a spoil bestowed by God.

## Ayat 88

- `and brought out of there (from the molten gold) the effigy of a calf that lowed."`
- `The people cried out:`
- `"This is your deity and the deity of Moses, whom Moses has forgotten."`

## Ayat 89

- `Did they not see that it did not return a word to them,`
- `and had no power either to hurt them or to cause them any benefit?`
