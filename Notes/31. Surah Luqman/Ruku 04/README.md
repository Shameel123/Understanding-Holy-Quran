**Ayat 31 - 34**

## Ayat 31

- `Do you not see that ships sail in the sea by Allah's Grace that He may show you some of His Signs?`
- `Surely there are Signs in this for everyone who is steadfast, thankful.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, such signs show that all powers rest only with Allah. Man may make as strong and suitable ships for his sea journeys as he likes, and may achieve whatever perfection in marine science and in the related knowledge and experience, these by themselves cannot avail him anything to perform safe voyages especially when confronted by the terrible forces at the sea, unless he is succored by the grace of Allah.
  - As soon as Allah’s grace is withdrawn, man immediately realizes how meager and insufficient are the means and resources and knowledge of the sciences.
  - Similarly, man in the state of peace and security may be a hardened atheist or polytheist, but when his boat loses balance in the storm at sea, even the atheist comes to realize that there is God and the polytheist that there is only One God.


## Ayat 32

- `When waves engulf them (in the sea) like canopies, they call upon Allah, consecrating their faith solely to Him.`
- `But when He delivers them safely to the land, some of them become lukewarm.`
- `None denies Our Signs except the perfidious, the ungrateful.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Iqtisad” in the original may mean uprightness or moderateness. In the first case, the verse would mean: “A few of them only remain steadfast on Tauhid, which they had promised to follow when overwhelmed by the storm, and this makes them adhere to uprightness ever afterwards.”
  - If it is taken to mean moderateness, it would mean: Some of them become moderate and less rigid in their creed of atheism and polytheism, or they lose some of their fervor and enthusiasm that had been caused by the incident of calamity.
  - Most probably Allah has used this meaningful sentence here in order to allude to all the three states simultaneously.
  - The object probably is to point out the fact that during the storm at sea the mind of everybody is automatically set right, and everybody gives up atheism and polytheism and starts invoking One Allah for help.
  - But as soon as they safely land on the shore, only a few of them seem to have learned any enduring lesson from their experience.
  - Then, this small number also is divided into three groups: those who adopt uprightness ever afterwards, and those who become moderate in their disbelief, and Those who retain some of the spirit of enthusiasm caused temporarily by the calamity.

## Ayat 33

- `O people, fear (the wrath) of your Lord, and dread the Day when no father will stand for his child, nor any child stand for his father.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “The relationship of a person with his friend, or his leader, or his spiritual guide, etc. is not that close and intimate as the relationship that exists between the children and their parents. But on the Day of Resurrection even the son and the father will not be able to help each other. The father will not have the courage to come forward and say that he may be seized instead of the son for his sins, nor will the son have the nerve to say that he may be sent to Hell instead of the father. **How can then a person expect that one will be able to avail something for the other there?** Therefore, foolish is the person who spoils his Hereafter in the world for the sake of another, or adopts the way of sin and deviation by dependence on others. Here, one should keep in view the theme of verse 15, in which the children have been admonished not to accept deviation in the matter of the faith and religion on behest of the parents, though in affairs of mundane life they are duty bound to serve them as best as they can.”
- `Surely Allah's promise is true.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Allah’s promise”: the promise of Resurrection, when the court of Allah will be established and everyone will be called to render an account of his deeds.
- `So let the life of this world not beguile you,`
- `nor let the Deluder delude you about Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Al-gharur (the deceiver) may be Satan or a man or a group of them, or even man’s own self, or something else. The reason for using this comprehensive and meaningful word in its absolute form without identifying a particular person or thing is that for different people there are different means that cause them deception. Any particular means or cause that deceived a person to be misled and misguided from the right way to the wrong way, will be algharur in his particular case.
    - “To deceive about Allah” are also comprehensive words, which include countless kinds of deceptions. The deceiver deceives one man with the idea that there is no God at all, and another man with the idea that God after making the world has handed over its control and administration to the men and is no more concerned with it; he misleads another one, saying, “There are some favorite ones of God: if you attain nearness to them, you will surely win your forgiveness whatever you may do, or may have done, in the world;” he deceives another one, saying, “God is All- Forgiving and All-Merciful: you may go on committing sins freely, and He will go on forgiving each sin of yours.” He gives another person the idea of determinism and misguides him, saying, “Everything that you do is pre-ordained: if you commit evil, it is God Who makes you commit it: if you avoid goodness, it is God Who makes you avoid it.” Thus, there are countless types of such deceptions with which man is being deceived concerning God. When analyzed, it comes to light that the basic cause of all errors and sins and crimes is that man has been deceived concerning God in one way or the other, and that is how he has been misled to some ideological deviation or moral error.


## Ayat 34

- `Surely Allah alone has the knowledge of the Hour.`
- `It is He`
  - `Who sends down the rain and`
  - `knows what is in the wombs,`
- `although no person knows`
  - `what he will earn tomorrow,`
  - `nor does he know in which land he will die.`
- **`Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.`**
