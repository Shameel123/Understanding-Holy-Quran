**Ayat 20 - 30**

## Ayat 20

- `Have you not seen that Allah has subjected to your service all that is in the heavens`
- `and on the earth and has abundantly bestowed upon you all His bounties, both visible and invisible?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Apparent favors” imply those favors which are perceived by man in one way or the other, or are known to him. And the “hidden favors” are those which are neither perceived by him nor are known to him.
    - There are countless things in man’s own body and in the world outside him, which are working in his interest, but man is utterly unaware of the means which his Creator has provided for his protection and safety, for his development and provision of sustenance to him, and for his well-being and happiness.
    - Research of man in the different branches of science is revealing many such favors of God as were hidden from him before. And the favors and blessings which have so far been revealed are insignificant as against those which are still hidden from man.
- `Yet some persons dispute regarding Allah`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Who disputes about Allah”: Who wrangle and dispute about questions such as these: 
      - Does Allah exist or not?
      - Is He One God alone, or are there other gods also?
      - What are His attributes and what is their nature?
      - What is the nature of His relationship with His creations etc.?
- `without having any knowledge`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they neither have any means of knowledge by which they might themselves have observed or experienced the reality directly, nor do they have the guidance of a guide available to them, who might have guided them after observing the reality, nor do they possess a divine Book, which might be the basis of their belief.
- `or guidance or any illuminating Book.`

## Ayat 21

- `When they are told:`
  - `“Follow what Allah has revealed,”`
- `they say:`
  - `“We will rather follow that which we have found our forefathers following.”`
- `(Will they follow that) even though Satan might invite them to the chastisement of the Blazing Fire?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it is not at all necessary that the forefathers of every person and every family and nation should have been on the right path. The mere argument that a particular way of life had been bequeathed by the elders cannot be a proof of its being right also. No sane person can commit the folly that he should blindly go on following the way of his forefathers even if they were not rightly guided, and should never bother to find out where the way is leading him.

## Ayat 22

- `Whoever surrenders himself to Allah`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, practically also he should adopt the attitude of an obedient servant of Allah.
- `and lives righteously`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, practically also he should adopt the attitude of an obedient servant of Allah.
- `grasps the most firm handle.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, he will neither have the apprehension that he will be misguided, nor the fear that he will meet an evil end after having served Allah.
- `The ultimate decision of all matters rests with Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This means to say, “O Prophet, the one who refuses to listen to you, thinks that by rejecting Islam and insisting on unbelief he has harmed you, but in fact he has not harmed you but harmed only himself. If he does not listen to you, you need not bother yourself about him at all.”

## Ayat 23

- `So let the unbelief of the unbeliever not grieve you.`
- `To Us is their return and then We shall inform them of all that they did.`
- `Surely Allah knows well even the secrets that are hidden in the breasts (of people).`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “Thank God that you at least know this and believe in this. But if this be the reality, all praise should then belong to Allah alone. How can any other being deserve praise when it has no share whatever in the creation of the universe?”


## Ayat 24

- `We allow them to enjoy themselves a while in the world and then We shall drive them in utter helplessness to a harsh chastisement.`

## Ayat 25

- `If you were to ask them:`
  - **`“Who created the heavens and the earth?”`**
- `they will certainly reply:`
- **``“Allah.”`**
- `Say:`
  **- `“All praise and thanks be to Allah.”`**
- `Yet most of them do not know.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That, is, “Most of the people do not know what are the inevitable results and demands of accepting Allah as the Creator of the universe, and what contradicts it. When a person acknowledges Allah as the Creator of the earth and the heavens. He should also acknowledge that Allah alone is the Deity and Lord: that He alone is worthy of worship and obedience: that He alone can be invoked for needs, and no one other than Him can be the Law-Giver and Ruler of His creation. To acknowledge one as the Creator and another as the deity is contrary to reason and a contradiction in terms, which can be upheld only by an ignorant person. Likewise, it would be a contradiction in terms to believe in one Being as the Creator and to regard another from among the creation as remover of hardships or as a deity and possessor of power and authority and sovereignty, which no reasonable person will acknowledge and accept.”
  - That is, “The reality is not merely this that Allah is the Creator of the earth and the heavens, but in fact He alone is the Master of all things found in the earth and heavens. Allah has not created his universe and left it to others to become masters of the whole or a part of it, but He Himself is Master of His creation and everything that exists in this universe is His. Here, He alone possesses divine rights and powers and no one else.”

## Ayat 26

- `All that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah`
- `Verily He is All-Sufficient, Immensely Praiseworthy.`


## Ayat 27

- **`If all the trees on earth become pens, and the sea replenished by seven more seas were to supply them with ink, the Words of Allah would not be exhausted.`**
- `Verily Allah is Most Mighty, Most Wise.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Words of Allah”: Allah’s creative works and the manifestations of His power and wisdom. This very theme has been presented in Surah Al-Kahf: Ayat 109 a little differently. A person might think there is exaggeration in this, but if one considers the matter a little deeply, one will feel that there is in tact no exaggeration whatsoever in it. All the pens that can be made from the trees of the world and all the ink that can be provided by the oceans of the world, which are replenished by seven more oceans, cannot perhaps help prepare a complete list of all the creations in the universe, not to speak of all the manifestations of Allah’s power and wisdom and creative works. When it is impossible even to count all the things found on the earth only, how can one bring into writing all the creations found in this limitless universe?


## Ayat 28

- `To create all of you or to resurrect all of you is to Him like (creating or resurrecting) a single person.`
- `Verily Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “He is hearing every sound in the universe distinctly at one and the same time, and no sound can absorb his hearing so completely that He may hear no other sound. Likewise, He is seeing the whole universe in each of its details as to thing and event at one and the same time and nothing can absorb His sight so completely that He may see nothing else.
  - The same precisely is the case concerning the creation of men and their re-creation also. He can re-create instantaneously all the men who have been born since the beginning of the creation and will be born till the end of time, His creative power is not absorbed so completely in the creation of one man that He may be unable to create other men at the same time. For Him the creation of one man and of the billions of men, therefore, is equal and one and the same thing.”
 
## Ayat 29

- `Do you not see that Allah makes the night phase into the day and makes the day phase into the night and has subjected the sun and the moon to His will`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the appearance and alternation of the day and night consistently and regularly by itself shows that the sun and the moon have been subjected to a system. The sun and the moon have been mentioned here in particular because both these are the most prominent bodies of the heaven, which man has been worshiping as deities since the earliest times, and which many people worship as gods even today. The fact, however, is that Allah has bound all the stars and planets of the universe including the earth into an unalterable system from which they cannot deviate even by an inch.
- `so that each of them is pursuing its course till an appointed time? (Do you not know that)`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, nothing in the world, whether the sun or the moon, or any other star or planet, in the universe, is eternal and ever-lasting. Everything has a term for it and can function only till its expiry. Everything has a beginning in time before which it was not there and an end in time after which it will not be there. This means to imply that such temporal and powerless things cannot become the deities of men.
- `Allah is well aware of all that you do?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “The real Sovereign is Allah. He alone is the real Owner of power and authority over the creation and its disposal.”


## Ayat 30

- `All this is because Allah, He alone, is the Truth`
- `and all that which they call upon beside Him is false.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “They are figments of your own imagination. You have yourselves presumed that so-and-so has got a share in Godhead, and so-and-so has been given the powers to remove hardships and fulfill needs, whereas in fact none of them has any power to make or un-make anything.”
- `Surely Allah, He alone, is All-High, Incomparably Great.3`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “He is the Highest of all before Whom everything is low, and He is the Greatest of all before Whom everything is small.”
