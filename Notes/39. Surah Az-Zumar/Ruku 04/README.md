**Ayat 32 - 41**

## Ayat 32

- `Who, then, can be more unjust than he who lied against Allah`
- `and denied the Truth when it came to him, calling it a lie?`
- `Is there no room for such unbelievers in Hell?`

## Ayat 33

- `But he who brought the Truth,`
- `and those who confirmed it as true,`
- `such are the ones who shall be guarded against the chastisement.`

## Ayat 34

- `They shall have from their Lord all that they wish for.`
- `That is the reward of those that do good,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - One should note that the words used here are indarabbi- him (with their Lord) and not fil-jannah (in Paradise), and obviously man reaches in the presence of his Lord just after death.
  - Therefore, the intention of the verse seems to be: Not only after entering Paradise but right from the time of death till his entry into Paradise **Allah will treat the righteous believer in the same kind manner**.
  - The believer will certainly desire to be saved from the torment of barzakh, from the severities of the Day of Resurrection and Judgment, from the humiliation of the Plain of Gathering and from the punishment of his errors and shortcomings, and Allah Almighty will fulfill all his desires.

## Ayat 35

- `so that Allah may remit their worst deeds and reward them according to the best of their deeds.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The people who believed in the Prophet (peace be upon him) had happened to commit most heinous sins, both ideological and moral, in the days of ignorance, and after affirmation of the faith the good that they did was not only that they gave up the falsehood they had been professing and accepted the truth that the Prophet (peace be upon him) had presented, but in addition, they had performed the best righteous acts in morality, devotion and in their dealings with others.
  - Allah says:
    - **The worst deeds that they had committed in the days of ignorance will be wiped off from their account, and they will be rewarded for the best of their deeds found in their conduct book.**

## Ayat 36

- `(O Prophet), does Allah not suffice for His servant?`
- `They frighten you with others apart from Him,`
- `although he whom Allah lets go astray, none can guide him to the Right Way.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The disbelievers of Makkah used to say to the Prophet (peace be upon him): You behave insolently in respect of our deities and utter rude words against them. You do not know how powerful they are and what miraculous powers they possess. Anybody who dishonored them was ruined. If you also do not desist from what you say against them, you too will be annihilated.

## Ayat 37

- `And he whom Allah guides to the Right Way,`
- `none can lead him astray.`
- **`Is not Allah the Most Mighty, the Lord of Retribution?`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, this also is a result of their lack of guidance that the foolish people esteem highly the power and honor of their deities but they never think that Allah also is All- Mighty and they can also be punished for insulting Him by the shirk they are committing against Him.

## Ayat 38

- `If you ask them:`
  - `“Who created the heavens and the earth?”`
- `they will surely answer:`
  - `“Allah.”`
- `Tell them:`
  - `“What do you think, then, of the deities whom you call upon instead of Allah? If Allah should will that an affliction befall me, will those deities remove the harm inflicted by Him? Or if Allah should will that I receive (His) Mercy, will they be able to withhold His Mercy from me?”`
- `Say:`
  - `“Allah is sufficient for me;`
  - `those who have to put their trust, let them put their trust in Him.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Ibn Abi Hatim has related from Ibn Abbas that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: **The person who desires that he should become most powerful among men should repose his trust in Allah. And the person who desires that he should become the wealthiest among men should have more trust in that which is with Allah than that which is in his own hand. And the person who desires that he should become most honorable among men should fear Allah All- Mighty.**

## Ayat 39

- `Tell them:`
  - `“My people, continue to work in your position as you will, I too will continue with my work. Soon you shall know`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, you may go on doing what you can in order to harm me and do not give me any respite.

## Ayat 40


- `whom the degrading chastisement will visit`
- `and upon whom the everlasting chastisement will alight.`

## Ayat 41

- `(O Prophet), We revealed to you the Book with the Truth for all mankind.`
- `So he who follows the Right Way does so to his own benefit, and he who goes astray, shall hurt only himself by straying.`
- `You are not accountable on their behalf.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, it is not for you to bring them to the right path. Your only duty is to present the right path before them. If they prefer to remain astray after that, you are not responsible for it.
