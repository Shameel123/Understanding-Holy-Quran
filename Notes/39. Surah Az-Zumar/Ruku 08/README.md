**Ayat 71 - 75**

## Ayat 71

- `(After the judgement has been passed)`
- `the unbelievers shall be driven in companies to Hell`
- `so that when they arrive there,`
- `its gates shall be thrown open1`
- `and its keepers shall say to them:`
  - `“Did Messengers from among yourselves not come to you, rehearsing to you the Signs of your Lord and warning you against your meeting of this Day?”`
- `They will say:`
  - `“Yes indeed; but the sentence of chastisement was bound to be executed against the unbelievers.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the gates of Hell will not have already been opened but will be opened on their arrival there just as the gate of a prison is opened on the arrival of the culprits and is closed as soon as they have entered it.

## Ayat 72

- `It will be said:`
  - `“Enter the gates of Hell. Herein shall you abide.”`
- `How evil is the abode of the vainglorious!`


## Ayat 73

- `And those who eschewed disobeying their Lord shall be driven in companies to Paradise so that when they arrive there its gates will have already been thrown open and its keepers shall say to them:`
  - `“Peace be upon you; you have done well. So enter. Herein you shall abide.”`

## Ayat 74

- `They will say:`
  - `“All thanks and praise be to Allah Who has made His promise to us come true,`
  - `and Who gave us the earth to inherit.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - For explanation, see(Surah Ta Ha, Ayats 106-107,124); (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 106-107 )and the E.Ns thereof.
  - `We may now dwell in Paradise wherever we please.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, the Paradise which has been granted to each of us, is now our property and we possess full rights over it.
  - `How excellent is the reward of those who laboured!`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Maybe this is said by the dwellers of Paradise, or maybe this sentence is added by Allah to what the dwellers of Paradise will say.

## Ayat 75

- `You shall see the angels surrounding the Throne,`
- `glorifying their Lord with His praise,`
- `and judgement will have been made among them with fairness,`
- `and it will be proclaimed:`
  - **`“All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the whole Universe.” `**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the entire Universe will proclaim the praises of Allah All-Mighty.
