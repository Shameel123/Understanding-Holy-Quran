**Ayat 42 - 52**

## Ayat 42

- `It is Allah Who takes away the souls of people at the hour of their death, and takes away at the time of sleep the souls of those that have not died.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Taking the souls during sleep, implies the suspension of the powers of feeling and consciousness, understanding and will.
- `Then He retains the souls of those against whom He had decreed death and returns the souls of others till an appointed time.`
- `Surely there are Signs in this for a people who reflect.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - By this Allah wants every man to realize how life and death are entirely in His own hand. No one has the guarantee that he will certainly get up alive in the morning when he goes to sleep at night. No one knows what disaster could befall him within a moment, and whether the next moment would be a moment of life for him or of death. At any time, while asleep or awake, in the house or outside it, some unforeseen calamity, from inside his body or from outside, can suddenly cause his death. Thus, man who is so helpless in the hands of God, would be foolish if he turned away from the same God or became heedless of Him.

## Ayat 43

- `Or have they taken others instead of Allah as intercessors?`
- `Say:`
  - `“Will they intercede though they may have no power and though they may not even understand?”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, in the first place, these people have foolishly presumed that there are some beings who wield great influence with Allah, and whose intercession is never turned down, whereas there is no proof of their being intercessors at all, nor has Allah ever said that they hold such a position with Him, nor did these beings themselves ever claim that they would use their influence with Allah and help them out in every case. Another folly of these people is that they have ignored the real Master and have believed the imaginary beings to be all powerful who deserve to receive all their devotion and dedication.

## Ayat 44

- `Say:`
  - `“All intercession lies with Allah.`
  - `His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth.`
  - `And to Him will all of you be sent back.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, not to speak of getting his intercession granted, no one has the power to stand before Allah as an intercessor. The right to grant or not to grant anyone the permission to intercede with Him exclusively rests with Allah. Then He may allow intercession for whomever He may please and forbid for whomever He may please. (For understanding the difference between the Islamic concept of intercession and the polytheistic concept, see(Surah Al- Baqarah, Ayat 255); (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayat 51);(Surah Younus, Ayats 3, 18); (Surah Hud, Ayat 105); (Surah Ar- Raad, Ayat 11); (Surah An-Naml, Ayats 73, 84);(Surah TaHa, Ayats 109-110); (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayat 23);(Surah Al-Hijr, Ayat 76), and the E.Ns thereof and(E.N. 40 of Saba).

## Ayat 45

- `When Allah alone is mentioned,`
- `the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter contract with bitterness,`
- `but when deities apart from Allah are mentioned, they are filled with joy.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This evil is common to almost all polytheistic people of the world, and even some unfortunate Muslims also suffer from it, They profess with the tongue that they believe in Allah, but when One Allah alone is mentioned before them, their faces arc distorted, and they say: This man certainly does not believe in the saints and holy men, that is why he talks of Allah and Allah alone.
  - And if others besides Allah are mentioned, they are delighted, and their faces brighten up with joy. Their this attitude shows as to who is the actual object of their love and esteem. Allama Alusi, in his commentary Ruh al-Maani, has related his own experience here. He says: One day I saw that a man was invoking the help of a dead saint in his affliction. I said: O bondsman of Allah, invoke Allah, for He Himself says: **If My servants ask you, O Prophet, concerning Me, tell them I am quite near to them. I hear and answer the prayer of the supplicant when he calls to Me,** (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 186), Hearing this, the man became angry. The people told me afterwards that he said: This man is a denier of the saints. And some others heard him also say: The saints answer the prayers more promptly than does Allah.

## Ayat 46

- `Say:`
  - `“O Allah,`
  - `the Originator of the heavens and the earth,`
  - `the Knower of the unseen and the seen,`
  - `You it is Who will judge among Your servants concerning what they differed.`

## Ayat 47

- `If the wrong-doers possessed the treasures of the earth in their entirety and as much besides, they would gladly offer it on the Day of Resurrection to redeem themselves from the harrowing chastisement.`
- `This because there will appear to them from Allah something (exceedingly dismal which) they had never even imagined.`

## Ayat 48

- `The evil consequences of their deeds will become fully apparent to them,`
- `and what they had scoffed at will encompass them.`

## Ayat 49

- `When an affliction befalls man,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “The man”: the one who has aversion to Allah and whose face is distorted on hearing Allah alone being mentioned.
- `he cries out to Us;`
- `but when We grant him a favour from Us,`
- `he says:`
  - `“I have been granted this on account of my knowledge.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This sentence can have two meanings:
        - (1) That Allah knows that I am worthy of this blessing. That is why He has given me All this, otherwise He would not have blessed me if I had been an evil and wicked person in His sight.
- `Nay; this (favour) is a test; but most of them do not know.`

## Ayat 50

- `Their predecessors also said the same, but their earnings proved of no avail to them,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, when they were seized for evil-doing, the ability of which they were so proud, did not avail them anything, and this also became known that they were not Allah’s favorites. Evidently, if their earning had been due to their capability and their being favorites with Allah, they would not have been seized for evil-doing at all.

## Ayat 51

- `and the evil consequences of their deeds overtook them.`
- `The wrongdoers among these will also be overtaken by the evil consequences of their deeds.`
- `They will be utterly unable to frustrate (Us).`

## Ayat 52

- `Do they not know that Allah enlarges and straitens the provision of whomsoever He pleases?`
- `Therein are Signs for those that believe.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the abundance or restriction of the provisions is based on another law of Allah, which has some other wisdom. The distribution of the provisions does not at all depend on man’s worthiness and ability, or on his being a favorite of Allah, or for being under His wrath.
