**Ayat 22 - 31**

## Ayat 22

- `Can he whose breast Allah has opened up for Islam`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Whose breast... Islam”: Whom Allah helps to learn a lesson from these realities and to be satisfied with Islam as based on the truth.
    - Opening of a man’s breast for something is, in fact, a state in which there remains no anxiety or ambiguity or suspicion and doubt in his mind about the thing, nor has he the feeling of any danger and loss in accepting and adopting it, but he decides with full satisfaction of the heart that it is the truth; therefore, he must follow it whatever be the consequences.
    - Having made such a decision when a person adopts the way of Islam, he obeys whatever command he receives from Allah and His Messenger willingly and with pleasure, without any hesitation. He accepts whatever beliefs and ideas, rules and regulations he comes across in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him) as if they were the voice of his own heart. He does not feel any compunction on giving up an unlawful gain, because he believes that it was no gain for him at all; it was rather a loss from which Allah saved him by His grace.
    - Likewise, even if he incurs a loss while following the way of righteousness, he does not feel sad about this but bears it with patience and regards it as an ordinary loss as compared to the loss of turning away from the way of Allah.
    - The same is his behavior on confronting dangers. He believes that there is no other way for him, which he may follow in order to avoid the danger. The straight way of Allah is only one, which he has to follow in any case. If there is a danger in following it, let it be.
- `and who is thus (moving along a Path) illumined by a light from Allah`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Upon a light from his Lord”: In the light of the knowledge of the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him), by the help of which he sees clearly at every step which is the straight path of the truth among the countless by-paths of life.
- `(be likened to him who derives no lesson from what he observes)?`
- `Woe, then, to those whose hearts were further hardened after Allah's admonition.`
  - Tahfim-ul-QUran:
    - As against the opening of the breast there can be two other states of man’s heart:
      - (1) The state of narrowing of the breast and squeezing of the heart; and in this state there still remains some room for the truth to permeate it.
      - (2) The state of hardening or petrifying of the heart; in this there is left no room whatever for the truth to permeate.
    - About this second state Allah says that the person who reaches such a stage is totally ruined. This means that if a person becomes inclined to accept the truth, even though with an unveiling and squeezed heart, there remains some possibility for him to be redeemed. This second theme becomes obvious from the style and tenor of the verse itself, though Allah has not stated it directly.
    - For the real intention of the verse was to warn those who were bent upon stubbornness in their antagonism towards the Prophet (peace be upon him) and had made up their mind not to listen to him at all. For this they have been warned, as if to say: You take pride in this stubbornness of yours, but, as a matter of fact, there cannot be a greater misfortune and unworthiness of man than that his heart should become even more hardened, instead of becoming soft, when he hears Allah being mentioned and the admonition sent by Him.
- `Such are indeed in obvious error.`

## Ayat 23

- `Allah has revealed the best teaching, a self-consistent Book`
- `which repeats its contents in manifold forms`
- `whereat shiver the skins of those that hold their Lord in awe, and then their skins and their hearts soften for Allah's remembrance.`
- `That is Allah's Guidance wherewith He guides whosoever He pleases.`
- `And he whom Allah does not guide to the Right Path has none to guide him.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, there is no contradiction and disagreement between them. The whole Book, from the beginning to the end, projects one and the same aim, one and the same belief, and one and the same system of thought and action. Each of its parts confirms and supports and explains the other themes; and there is perfect consistency in it both in meaning and in style.

## Ayat 24

- `How woeful is the plight of him who has nothing except his face to shield him from severe chastisement on the Day of Resurrection?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - One takes a blow on his face only when he is absolutely helpless and powerless, otherwise until one has some power to resist, he goes on receiving the blows on the other parts of his body but saves his face.
    - Therefore, here the extreme state of helplessness of a person has been depicted, saying that he will receive the severe punishment on his face.
- `Such evil-doers shall be told:`
  - `“Taste now the consequence of your deeds.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The word kasab, in the Quranic terminology, implies one’s descrying and earning a reward and punishment in consequence of his actions and deeds.
      - The real earning of a doer of good is that he becomes worthy of Allah’s reward, and the earning of the evil-doer is the punishment that he will receive in the Hereafter.

## Ayat 25

- `Their predecessors gave the lie to the Truth`
- `and then chastisement came upon them from whence they could not imagine.`

## Ayat 26

- `So Allah made them taste degradation in the life of this world,`
- `and certainly the chastisement of the Hereafter will be much more grievous.`
- `Would that they knew!`

## Ayat 27

- **`We have indeed propounded for mankind all kinds of parables in this Qur'an that they may take heed.`**

## Ayat 28

- `It is an Arabic Qur'an`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it has not been sent down in a foreign language so that the people of Makkah and Arabia should stand in need of a translator or interpreter, but it is in their own language, which they can understand directly.
- `free of all crookedness`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, there is nothing of double-dealing in it so that a common man should find it difficult to understand, but everything has been presented in it in a straightforward manner, from which everyone can know what this Book states as wrong and why, what it states as right and on what ground, what it wants the people to accept and what it wants them to reject, and what it enjoins and what it forbids.
- `that they may guard against their evil end.`

## Ayat 29

- `Allah propounds a parable:`
  - `there is a man whose ownership is shared by several quarrelsome masters, each pulling him to himself;`
  - `and there is another who is exclusively owned by one man.`
  - `Can the two be alike?`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Allah in this parable has explained the difference between shirk and Tauhid and the impact each has on human life so clearly that it is not possible to put across such a vast theme so concisely and effectively in other words.
      - Everyone will admit that the person who has many masters, each one pulling him to himself, and the masters are also so ill-tempered that no one spares him time in his service to obey the other, and no one rests content only with threatening and cursing him if he fails to carry out his command from among the contradictory commands of the other masters, but is bent upon punishing him, his life would certainly be in great anguish.
      - On the contrary, the person, who is the slave or servant of only one master, would be living a life of ease and comfort because he will not have to serve and seek the pleasure of another master. **This is such a straightforward thing which does not need deep consideration for its understanding.** After this it remains no longer difficult for a person to understand that the peace of mind and satisfaction that accrue to him from the service of One God, can never accrue from the service of many gods.
  - `All praise and thanks be to Allah.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Here, it should be understood well that the parable of many ill-tempered and contesting masters cannot apply to the images of stone, but **it only applies to living masters, who practically give contradictory commands to many** and keep pulling him to themselves in actual realit.
      - **One such master sits in his own self**, which presents before him desires of every kind and compels him to fulfill them.
      - Other countless masters are there **in the house, in the family, in the brotherhood, in the society, among the religious guides and the rulers and legislators, in the business and economic circles and among the dominant powers of civilization** whose contradictory demands and requirements keep on pulling man to themselves at All times;
      - then any god whose demand he fails to fulfill in any way, does not let him go unpunished in his own circle.
      - However, each one’s instrument of punishment is different. 
      - Someone causes a heart-break, another takes offense, another humiliates, another boycotts, another bankrupts, another makes a religious or a legal attack. Man has no other way of being saved from this anguish and agony but to adopt the way of Tauhid and become the slave of One God, and throw off the yoke of servitude of every other god.
  - `But most of them are unaware.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Adoption of the Way of Tauhid also has two forms, which lead to different results:

## Ayat 30

- `(O Prophet),`
- `you are destined to die and they too are destined to die.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There is a subtle gap between the preceding sentence and this, which can be filled by every intelligent person himself by a little consideration of the context.
  - It contains this theme: You are making every effort to make the people understand a simple thing in a simple way, but they are not only showing stubbornness with regard to what you say and rejecting it but are also bent upon harming you in order to suppress the manifest truth.
  - Well, neither you are immortal nor they. Both you and they have to die one day. then, each of you will experience his own end.


## Ayat 31

- `Then eventually all of you will contend before your Lord on the Day of Resurrection.`
