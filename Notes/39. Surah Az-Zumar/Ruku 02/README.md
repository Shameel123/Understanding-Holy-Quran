**Ayat 10 - 21**

## Ayat 10

- `Tell them (O Prophet):`
  - `“O you servants of Mine who believe,`
  - `have fear of your Lord.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, do not rest content with belief but follow it up with piety and fear of God. Act according to what Allah has enjoined and avoid what He has forbidden and live in the world fearing His accountability.
  - `A good end awaits those who did good in this world.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Good and well-being both of this world and of the Hereafter.
  - `Allah's earth is spacious.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, if one city, territory or land has become difficult for the worshipers of Allah, they may emigrate to another place where they may not have to face any such hardship.
  - `Verily those who persevere shall be granted their reward beyond all reckoning.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Those who brave all kinds of hardships and persecutions in following the way of God-worship and piety but do not abandon the way of the truth. This also includes those people who emigrate to other countries and experience hardships in the foreign land for the sake of religion and faith, and those also who continue to face every kind of temptation and calamity firmly and patiently in the land where they are being persecuted.

## Ayat 11

- `Tell them, (O Prophet):`
  - `“I am bidden to serve Allah, consecrating my devotion to Him,`

## Ayat 12

- `and I am bidden to be the first of those who surrender to Him.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, my mission is not only to exhort others but also to practice what I preach to myself. First, I follow the way which I call others to follow.

## Ayat 13

- `Say:`
  - `“If I disobey my Lord, I fear the chastisement of an Awesome Day.”`

## Ayat 14

- `Say:`
  - `“Allah alone shall I serve, consecrating my devotion to Him.`

## Ayat 15

- `So serve, apart from Him, whomsoever you please.”`
- `Say:`
  - `“Behold, the real losers shall be those who will have lost their own selves and their kith and kin on the Day of Resurrection.`
  - `Behold, that is the obvious loss.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Bankruptcy is loss of a person’s capital and failure of his business so that he is unable to pay his debts in full. This same metaphor Allah has used here for the disbelievers and polytheists, 
  - The sum total of whatever man has gotten in this worldly life, his intellect, body, powers, capabilities, means and opportunities is, in fact, the capital which he invests in the business of the worldly life. If a person invested all this capital on the hypothesis that there is no God, or that there are many gods, whose servant he is, and that he is not accountable to anyone, or that someone else will rescue him on Judgment Day, it would mean that he made a losing bargain and lost all his capital. **This is his first loss**.
  - His second loss is that in everything that he did, on the basis of the wrong hypothesis, he went on wronging himself and many other men, and the coming generations and many other creatures of Allah, throughout his life. **Thus, he got into countless debts, but has no money with which he may fully pay his debts.**
  - Over and above this, he has not only himself incurred this loss, but has caused the same loss to his children and near and dear ones and friends and fellow countrymen by his wrong education and training and wrong example.
  - **It is these three losses together which Allah has called khusran-i-mubin (utter bankruptcy) in this verse.**

## Ayat 16

- `There shall be sheets of fire above them and beneath them.`
- `This is the end against which Allah warns His servants.`
- `So dread My wrath, O you servants of Mine!”`

## Ayat 17

- `(On the other hand), good tidings await those who`
- `eschew serving false gods`
- `and penitently return to Allah. (O Prophet),`
- `give good tidings to My servants,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Taghut is from tughyan and means rebellion. If someone is called taghut (rebellion) instead of taghi (rebel), it would mean that he is a rebel incarnate.
  - For example, if a person is called husn (beauty) instead of hasin (beautiful), it would mean that he has reached perfection in beauty. 
  - The deities other than Allah have been called taghut because it is rebellion to worship others besides Allah, but the one who has others worship him, is a rebel of the worst kind.
    - (For further explanation, see(Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 256), (Surah An-Nisa, Ayats 60, 76), (Surah An-Naml, Ayat 36) and the E.Ns thereof).

## Ayat 18

- `to those who pay heed to what is said and follow the best of it.`
- `They are the ones whom Allah has guided to the Right Way;`
- `they are the ones endowed with understanding.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse can have two meanings:

## Ayat 19

- `(O Prophet), can you save him (from chastisement) against whom the sentence of chastisement has become due;`
- `him who has, (as it were), already fallen into the Fire?”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the person who has made himself worthy of Allah’s punishment and about whom Allah has already decided that he will be punished.

## Ayat 20

- `But those who fear their Lord shall have lofty mansions built over one another beneath which rivers flow.`
- **`This is Allah's promise and never does Allah fail to fulfil His promise.`**

## Ayat 21

- `Do you not see that`
- `Allah sent down water from the sky,`
- `then made it flow on earth as springs and streams and rivers`
  - I think, I am at this stage of life currently.
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word yanaabi in the text is comprehensive and applies to all the three sources of water.
- `and then with it He brings forth vegetation of various hues;`
- `then this vegetation ripens and dries up, turning yellow, whereafter He reduces it to broken straw?`
- `Surely there is a lesson in this for those endowed with understanding.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, a man of understanding learns this lesson from it that the life of this world and its adornments are all transitory.
  - The end of every spring is autumn.
  - The fate of every youth is weakness and death.
  - And every rise has a fall.
  - Therefore, this world is not something of which one should be charmed and enamored so as to forget God and the Hereafter and should conduct himself here in a manner as to ruin his Hereafter, only for the sake of enjoying the short lived pleasures of this world.
  - Then a man of understanding also learns this lesson from these phenomena that the spring and autumn of this world are only under Allah’s control. Allah allows to grow and prosper whomsoever He wills and ruins and lays waste whomsoever He wills. Neither it is in anybody’s power to stop the growth of someone whom Allah wills to grow, nor has anyone the power to save him from destruction whom Allah wills to destroy.
