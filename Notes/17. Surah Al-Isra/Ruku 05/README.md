**Ayat 41 - 52**

## Ayat 41

- `We have expounded (the Truth) in diverse ways in this Qur'an that they might take it to heart but all this only aggravates their aversion.`

## Ayat 42

- `Say, (O Muhammad):`
  - `"Had there been other gods with Him, as they claim, they would surely have attempted to find a way to the Lord of the Throne.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, they would have themselves tried their best to become masters of the Throne.
  - This is because if there had been more than one partners in Godhead, it would produce one of the two results:
    1. If they were all independent gods, it was not conceivable that they would agree and cooperate with one another in the management of the boundless universe and there could never have been unanimity, uniformity and balanced proportion in its functioning. There would have been conflict at every step and everyone would have tried to dominate others in order to become its sole master.
    2. if one of them had been the supreme god and the others his obedient servants whom he had delegated some of his powers, then, according to the maxim “power corrupts”, they would never have been content with remaining obedient servants of the supreme god and would have conspired to become the supreme god themselves.

## Ayat 43

- `Holy is He and far above all that they say.`

## Ayat 44

- `The seven heavens, the earth, and all that is within them1 give glory to Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the entire universe and everything in it bear witness to the fact that their Creator and Guardian is free from each and every fault, defect and weakness, and that He is far above this that there should be any partner or associate in His Godhead.
- `There is nothing but gives glory to Him with His praise,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Everything is not only singing hymns of the glory of its Creator but is affording the proof that He is perfect in every respect and worthy of all praise. Everything is an embodiment of the proof that its Creator and Administrator is the one in whom there is perfection of every quality. Therefore, He alone is worthy of praise.
- `though you do not understand their hymns of praise.`
- `He is Most Forbearing, Exceedingly Forgiving."`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it is due to His forbearance and forgiveness that though you are persistently insolent to Him and go on inventing one false thing or the other against Him, He forbears and forgives you.
    - He neither withholds provisions from you nor deprives you of His favors nor strikes an insolent person instantly dead with a thunderbolt.
    - Above all, He is so forbearing and forgiving that He gives long enough respite to the individuals and communities to mend their ways, sends His prophets and reformers for their admonition and guidance and forgives all the past mistakes and errors, if one sincerely repents and adopts the right way.

## Ayat 45

- `When you recite the Qur'an, We place a hidden barrier between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter;`

## Ayat 46

- `and We place a covering on their hearts so that they do not comprehend it,`
- `and We cause a heaviness in their ears;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This refers to the divine law according to which those people, who do not believe in the Hereafter, cannot benefit from the Quran. 
    - Allah has attributed this law to Himself, as if to say: The natural result of disbelief in the Hereafter is that the heart of such a man becomes dull and his ears become deaf to the message of the Quran, for Quran bases its invitation on the belief in the Hereafter.
    - So it warns the people that they should not be deluded by this apparent aspect of the worldly life if there appears to be none to call them to account here; for it does not mean they are not at all accountable and answerable to anyone. Likewise if Allah allows freedom of belief to practice shirk, atheism, disbelief or Tauhid with impunity in this world, and their practice does not appear to make any practical difference in this world, it does not mean that these things do not produce any results at all.
    - For, in fact, everyone shall be accountable and answerable after death in the next world. Then everyone will realize that the doctrine of Tauhid alone is true and all other doctrines are false. 
    - For, if at present the consequences of deeds do not appear after death, they shall inevitably appear, but the reality has now been hidden behind an invisible curtain. There is an inevitable moral law according to which submission to it will bear its fruit and disobedience shall incur its losses.
    - As decisions according to this moral law will be made in the Hereafter. You should not be enticed by the charms of this transitory life. You should, therefore, keep in view that ultimately you shall have to render an account of all your deeds in this world before your Lord, and adopt that true creed and moral attitude which may be conducive to your success in the Hereafter.
- `and when you mention your Lord, the Only True Lord, in the Qur'an, they turn their backs in aversion.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - From this it must have become obvious that if a man does not believe in the Hereafter, he will never consider the message of the Quran worth his while but will hanker after this world and its joys which he can feel and experience.
    - Naturally his ears will not listen to the message and it will never reach the depths of his heart. Allah has stated this psychological fact in this verse.

## Ayat 47

- `We are well aware of what they wish to hear when they listen to you and what they say when they confer in whispers, when the wrong-doers say:`
  - `"You are only following one who is bewitched."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This refers to those devices which they conspired against the message of the Prophet (peace be upon him).
  - They would secretly listen to him, and then hold consultations in order to counteract this.
  - Sometimes it so happened that they suspected that someone had been influenced by the Quran. Then they would sit together and try to dissuade him, saying: How is it that you have been influenced by a person who himself is bewitched by some enemy and talks like this?

## Ayat 48

- `Just see how strange are the things they invent about you.`
- `They have altogether strayed, and are unable to find the right way.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is to say that they expressed different opinions at different times which contradicted each other. Sometimes they said: You are a sorcerer. And at other times: You have been bewitched by someone, or you are a poet or you are possessed of some evil spirit.
  - These contradictory things were a proof that they did not know the reality. Otherwise, they would not have invented a different name to suit each occasion. This also shows that they themselves were not sure of the charge they leveled against him. If they called him by one epithet one day, they themselves felt afterwards that it did not fit in. Then they would invent the second epithet and then the third and so on. Thus every new epithet contradicted the previous ones and showed that there was no truth in them, but in their enmity they were inventing one falsehood after the other.

## Ayat 49

- `They say:`
  - `"When we are turned to bones and particles (of dust), shall we truly be raised up as a new creation?"`

## Ayat 50

- `Tell them:`
  - `"(You will be raised afresh even if) you turn to stone or iron,`

## Ayat 51

- `or any other form of creation you deem hardest of all (to recreate from)."`
- `They will certainly ask:`
  - `"Who will bring us back (to life)?"`
- `Say:`
  - `"He Who created you in the first instance."`
- `They will shake their heads at you and inquire:`
  - `"When will that be?"`
- `Say: "Perhaps that time might have drawn near;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “They will shake their heads at you” in astonishment or to express doubt or disapproval or to scoff at you.

## Ayat 52

- `on the Day when He will call you and you will rise praising Him in response to His call,`
- `and you will believe that you had lain in this state only for a while."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, you will feel as if the intervening period between death and coming again to life on the Day of Resurrection was only a few hours or so, for you will think that you had just woken up after a short sleep by the sudden noise produced on the Day.
  - As regards to you will rise up praising Him, it is a subtle hint towards a great reality. At the time of rising up from death, both the believer and the unbeliever will be uttering the praise of Allah.
  - The believer will do so because in the worldly life also he believed in this creed and practiced it.
  - As regards the unbeliever, he will have the urge to do so because of the inherent and ingrained tendency in him which he had been suppressing by his folly. In the new life all those deliberate suppressions will vanish away and he will involuntarily utter the praise of Allah.
