**Ayat 78 - 84**

- `Establish Prayer`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Muslims have been commanded to establish Salat immediately after the mention of obstacles and adversities.
    - This implies that the perseverance required to face adverse circumstances is obtained by the establishment of Salat.
- `from the declining of the sun`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - We have translated the words of the Arabic text into “the declining of the sun.”
    - Though some of the companions and their followers are of the opinion that it means “the sunset”, the majority of them are of the opinion that it means “the declining of the sun from its zenith.” 
    - Umar, Ibn Umar, Anas bin Malik, Abu Barza-tal-Aslami, Hasan Basri, Shaabi, Ata, Mujahid and, according to a tradition, Ibn Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them all) are of this opinion and Imam Muhammad Baqir and Imam Jaafar Sadiq also are of the same opinion. 
    - Besides this, there are some traditions from the Prophet (peace be upon him) to the same effect, though they are not so authentic.
- `to the darkness of the night;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - According to some, the original words of the Arabic text mean “darkness of the night”, while others take it to mean “midnight”.
    - If the first opinion is accepted, it will imply “the beginning of the time of the salatul-isha, the isha prayer” and according to the other it will mean “the last limit of the time of salatul-isha.”
- `and hold fast to the recitation of the Qur'an at dawn,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The literal meaning of the word fajr is dawn, that is, “the beginning of the morning after the darkness of night.”
- `for the recitation of the Qur'an at dawn is witnessed.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here the “recital of the Quran in the morning” stands for the salatul-fajr, the morning prayer.
    - At some places the Quran has used the word salat for prayer and at other places a particular part of salat for prayer as a whole, e.g. tasbih, hamd, zikr, qayam, ruku, sajud etc.
    - Likewise, here “recital of the Quran at dawn” does not mean the mere recital of the Quran but its recital during the salatul-fajr.
    - Thus, the Quran has also incidentally referred to the different parts of which salat is composed and these guided the Prophet (peace be upon him) to prescribe the definite form of salat in which it is performed by the Muslims.

## Ayat 79

- `And rise from sleep during the night1 as well-`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The literal meaning of tahajjud is to rise up by breaking sleep. 
    - Therefore, it means: Rise up from sleep after the passing of a part of night and then offer your prayer.
- `this is an additional Prayer for you.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Nafl literally means: Something done in addition to an obligatory duty.
    - This shows that the tahajjud prayer is in addition to the five prescribed prayers.
- `Possibly your Lord will raise you to an honoured position.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Will raise you to an honored position”.
    - You may attain such a high position in this world and in the next world that people from everywhere may be full of praise for you, and you may become a praiseworthy personality.
    - This is, as if to say: Now your opponents are engaged in calling you names and are trying to defame you throughout the country, and have raised a storm of false accusations against you but that time is not far when the world will ring with the echoes of your praise and in the Hereafter you will become worthy of praise by all creatures.
    - The exaltation of the Prophet (peace be upon him) to the high position of intercession on the Day of Resurrection is also a part of that honored position.

## Ayat 80

- `And pray:`
  - `"My Lord! Cause me to enter wherever it be, with Truth, and cause me to exit, wherever it be, with Truth,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This prayer clearly shows that the time of Hijrah (Migration) had come near.
      - That is why Allah has instructed the Prophet (peace be upon him) to this effect:
        - You should follow the truth wherever and in whatever condition you be. If you migrate from a place, you should migrate for the sake of the truth, and wherever you go, you should go for the sake of the truth.
  - `and support me with authority from Yourself."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, either grant me power and authority or make some government my helper so that I may use its power to reform the corrupt world.
      - This is because power is required to check indecency and sin and to enforce the law of justice.

## Ayat 81

- `And proclaim:`
  - `"The Truth has come, and falsehood has vanished.`
  - `Surely falsehood is ever bound to vanish."`

## Ayat 82

- `What We are sending down in the course of revealing the Qur'an is a healing and a grace for those who have faith;`
- `but it adds only to the ruin of the wrong-doers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, those people who make the Quran their guide and their book of law, are favored with the blessing of Allah and are cured of all their mental, psychological, moral and cultural diseases.
  - On the other hand, those wicked people who reject this and turn their back on its guidance, in fact, are unjust to themselves. 
  - Therefore, the Quran does not allow them to remain even in that bad condition in which they were before its revelation or its knowledge but involves them in a greater loss than before.
  - **This is because before the revelation of the Quran or their acquaintance with it, they suffered from ignorance alone but when the Quran came before them and made distinct the difference between truth and falsehood, no excuse was left with them to remain in their previous condition of ignorance.**
  - After this, if they reject its guidance and persist in their deviation, it is a clear proof that they are not ignorant but workers of iniquity and worshipers of falsehood, which are averse to the truth.
  - For then their position is of the one who, when presented both poison and elixir, makes a choice of poison.
  - Therefore, they themselves are in that cast fully responsible for their deviation and whatever crimes they commit after that, shall incur their full punishment.
  - It is obvious that the consequent loss of wickedness must be far greater than the loss of ignorance.
  - The Prophet (peace be upon him) has summed this up in this concise and comprehensive sentence: The Quran is either an argument in your favor or against you.

## Ayat 83

- `Whenever We bestow favours upon man, he arrogantly turns away and draws aside;`
- `and whenever evil visits him, he is in utter despair.`

## Ayat 84

- `Say, (O Prophet):`
  - `"Each one acts according to his own manner.`
  - `Your Lord knows well who is best-guided to the Right Path."`
