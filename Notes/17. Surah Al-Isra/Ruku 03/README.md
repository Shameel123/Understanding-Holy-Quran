**Ayat 23 - 30**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
 - In the succeeding verses, those main basic principles have been put forward on which Islam desires to build the entire structure of human life.
 - These form the manifesto of the invitation of the Prophet (peace be upon him) declared by him at the end of the Makki stage of his mission, and the eve of the new stage at Al-Madinah so that it should be known to all that the new Islamic society and state were going to be built on such and such ideological, moral, cultural economic and legal principles. (Please also refer to(Ayats 151-153 and E.Ns thereof of Surah Al-Anaam).


## Ayat 23

- `Your Lord has decreed:`
  - `(i) Do not worship any but Him;`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This commandment is very comprehensive. It prohibits not only the worship of anyone except Allah but also implies that one should obey and serve and submit to Allah alone without question. 
      - One should accept His commandments and law alone to be worthy of obedience and His authority to be supreme above all.
      - This was not merely an instruction confined to a religious creed and individual practice but it served as the foundation of the moral, cultural, and political system which was practically established in Al-Madinah by the Prophet (peace be upon him).
      - Its first and foremost principle was that Allah alone is the Master, Sovereign and Law-giver.
  - `(ii) Be good to your parents;`
  - `and should both or any one of them attain old age with you, do not say to them even "fie" neither chide them, but speak to them with respect,`

## Ayat 24

- `and be humble and tender to them and say:`
  - `"Lord, show mercy to them as they nurtured me when I was small."`

## Ayat 25

- `Your Lord is best aware of what is in your hearts.`
- `If you are righteous, He will indeed forgive those who relent and revert (to serving Allah).`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse enjoins that after Allah’s right, the greatest of all the human rights is the right of parents.
  - Therefore, the children should obey and serve and respect their parents. The collective morality of society should make it incumbent on children to be grateful and respectful to their parents, they should serve them as they nursed and brought them up in their childhood.
  - Above all, this verse is not merely a moral recommendation but is the basis of the rights and powers of parents the details of which we find in the Books of Hadith and Fiqh. Moreover, respectful behavior and obedience to and observance of the rights of parents comprise the most important element of the material education and moral training in the Islamic society and civilization. Incidentally, all these things have determined forever the principle that the Islamic state shall make the family life sound and secure by laws, administrative regulations and educational policy and prevent its disintegration.

## Ayat 26

- `(iii) Give to the near of kin his due, and also to the needy and the wayfarer.`
- `(iv) Do not squander your wealth wastefully,`

## Ayat 27

- `for those who squander wastefully are Satan's brothers,`
- `and Satan is ever ungrateful to his Lord.`

## Ayat 28

- `(v) And when you must turn away from them - (that is, from the destitute, the near of kin, the needy, and the wayfarer) -`
- `in pursuit of God's Mercy which you expect to receive, then speak to them kindly.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - These three articles are meant to impress that a man should not reserve his earnings and his wealth exclusively for his own person.
  - He should do his utmost to fulfill his own necessities of life in a moderate way and render the rights of his relatives, neighbors and other needy persons as well.
  - This attitude will help create the spirit of cooperation, sympathy and justice in the collective Islamic life.
  - Thus every relative will cooperate with the other and every rich person will help the needy in his neighborhood and a wayfarer would find himself an honorable guest among generous hosts.
  - **The conception of rights should be so extensive that every person should consider that all other human beings have rights on his person and his property so that he should serve them with the idea that he is rendering their rights and is not doing any favor to them.**
  - In that case one would beg pardon of the other if he was unable to serve him and would pray to God to send his blessings upon him to enable him to serve His servants.

## Ayat 29

- `(vi) Do not keep your hand fastened to your neck nor outspread it, altogether outspread, for you will be left sitting rebuked, destitute.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “And do not keep your hand fastened to your neck”, means: Do not be parsimonious. “Nor outspread it altogether widespread” means: Do not be extravagant.
  - The Quran desires the people to follow the golden mean, i.e. they should neither be so parsimonious as to prevent the circulation of wealth nor so extravagant as to destroy their own economy.
  - On the contrary, they should learn to behave in a balanced manner so that they should spend money wherever it should be spent and refrain from becoming spendthrifts so as to involve themselves into trouble. 
  - As a matter of fact, it is ingratitude towards Allah’s favor to spend money for the sake of show, luxury and sinful acts and similar things which are neither man’s real necessities nor useful.
  - Therefore, those people who spend money lavishly on such things as these are the brethren of Satan.

## Ayat 30

- `Certainly Your Lord makes plentiful the provision of whomsoever He wills and straitens it for whomsoever He wills.`
- `He is well-aware and is fully observant of all that relates to His servants.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, man cannot realize the wisdom of the disparity of wealth among the people.
  - Therefore, man should not try to interfere by artificial means with the natural distribution of wealth.
  - It is wrong to level down natural inequality or to aggravate it by artificial means so as to make it unjust.
  - Both the extremes are wrong.
  - The best economic system is that which is established on the divine Way of the division of wealth.
