**Ayat 101 - 111**

## Ayat 101

- `We granted Moses nine clear signs.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It should be noted that this is the third answer to the demand of the disbelievers of Makkah for signs.
    - They said: We will not believe in you until you do this and do that before our eyes.
    - In answer to this demand, they are being warned: Nine clear signs, like the ones you are demanding, were shown one after the other to Pharaoh before you and you also know well what he said, simply because he did not want to believe in Moses (peace be upon him);
    - you also know that when he rejected the Prophet, even after seeing the signs, We drowned him.
- `Ask the Children of Israel about that: when these signs came forth, Pharaoh said to him:`
  - `"Moses, I think that you are bewitched."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The nine signs mentioned here have also been mentioned in(Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 133).`
  - These were:
    1. The staff which turned into a monster snake.
    2. Moses’ bright hand which shone like the sun.
    3. The public defeat of the sorcery of the magicians.
    4. Universal famine.
    5. Storm.
    6. Locusts.
    7. Lice.
    8. Frogs.
    9. Rain of blood.

## Ayat 102

- `Moses replied:`
  - `"You know well that no one but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has sent these as eye-opening proofs.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, I am not a bewitched man but you are indeed a doomed person.
      - As you have been persistent in your disbelief even after seeing such obvious divine signs, you are surety doomed to destruction.
  - `I truly think, O Pharaoh, that you are indeed doomed."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This part of the story of Pharaoh has been related here because it applied exactly to the mushriks of Makkah who were doing their best to uproot the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the believers from the land of Arabia.
      - This story, so to say, tells them: Pharaoh resolved to uproot Moses (peace be upon him) and the Israelites but was himself completely annihilated along with his followers.
      - But Moses (peace be upon him) and his followers settled down in the land. Likewise, if you persist on the same way, you will surely meet with the same end.

## Ayat 103

- `At last Pharaoh decided to uproot Moses and the Children of Israel from the land,`
- `but We drowned him together with all who were with him;`

## Ayat 104

- `and thereafter We said to the Children of Israel:`
  - `"Now dwell in the land,`
  - `but when the promised time of the Hereafter comes,`
  - `We shall bring you all together."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This part of the story of Pharaoh has been related here because it applied exactly to the mushriks of Makkah who were doing their best to uproot the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the believers from the land of Arabia.
  - This story, so to say, tells them: Pharaoh resolved to uproot Moses (peace be upon him) and the Israelites but was himself completely annihilated along with his followers.
  - But Moses (peace be upon him) and his followers settled down in the land.
  - Likewise, if you persist on the same way, you will surely meet with the same end.

## Ayat 105

- `We have sent down the Qur'an with the Truth, and it is with the Truth that it has descended.`
- `And We have not sent you but to proclaim good news and to warn.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, it is not your responsibility to cause, in a supernatural manner, springs to gush forth or gardens to grow or pieces of the sky to fall down in order to convince those people who do not judge the Quran by its teachings nor decide between the truth and falsehood on merit.
  - As the Quran has been sent down with truth, you should present it before the people and tell them plainly that the one, who believes, does so for his own good and the one who rejects it, does it at his own peril.

## Ayat 106

- `We have revealed the Qur'an in parts that you may recite it to people slowly and with deliberation;`
- `and (for that reason) We have revealed it gradually (to suit particular occasions).`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is an answer to this objection: Why has not Allah sent down His message as a whole?
  - Why is He sending it piecemeal?
  - Has Allah any need to think deliberately what to send down?
  - As the answer to this objection has been given in(Surah An-Nahal, Ayats 101-102) and in the Explanatory Notes 104-106 added to them.

## Ayat 107

- `Tell them, (O Prophet):`
  - `"Whether you believe in it, or do not believe,"`
- `but when it is recited to those who were given the knowledge before its revelation,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This refers to those people of the Book who were well versed in the Scriptures and could judge them from their themes and wording.
- `they fall down upon their faces in prostration`

## Ayat 108

- `and say:`
  - `"Glory be to our Lord. Surely the promise of our Lord was bound to be fulfilled."`

## Ayat 109

### Perform Sajdah On This Ayah

- `And they fall down upon their faces, weeping,`
- `and their humility increases`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, when they listen to the Quran, they at once recognize that its bearer is the promised Prophet mentioned in the Books of the former Prophets.
- `when (the Qur'an) is recited to them.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This attitude of the righteous people of the Book has been mentioned at several places in the Quran, e.g.,
      - (Surah Aal-Imran, Ayats 113-114, 199)
      - (Surah Al-Maidah, Ayats: 83-84)

## Ayat 110

- `Say to them (O Prophet!):`
  - `"Call upon Him as Allah or call upon Him as al-Rahman;`
  - `call Him by whichever name you will,`
  - `all His names are beautiful.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This is the answer to another objection of the disbelievers. 
      - They said: We have heard the name Allah for the Creator but where from have you brought the name **Rahman**?
      - This was because the name "Rahman” was not used for Allah and they did not like it.
  - `Neither offer your Prayer in too loud a voice, nor in a voice too low; but follow a middle course."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This instruction was given at Makkah.
      - Ibn Abbas relates that when the Prophet (peace be upon him) or his companions offered their prayers, they recited the Quran in a loud voice.
      - At this the disbelievers would raise a hue and cry and often called them names.
      - Therefore, they were enjoined that they should neither say their prayers in such a loud voice as might incite the disbelievers nor should they say it in such a low voice that their own companions might not hear it.
      - **This instruction was discontinued under the changed conditions at Al-Madinah. However, if the Muslims have to face the same conditions, at any place or at any time, they should observe the same instruction.**

## Ayat 110

- `And say:`
  - `"All praise be to Allah`
  - `Who has neither taken to Himself a son,`
  - `nor has He any partner in His kingdom,`
  - `nor does He need anyone, out of weakness, to protect Him."`
  - `So glorify Him in a manner worthy of His glory.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - A subtle sarcasm is implied in the sentence.
  - The mushriks believed that Allah had appointed assistants and deputies for the administration of His kingdom.
  - Obviously this meant that Allah was helpless and powerless to carry out the administration of His kingdom.
  - Therefore, He needed supporters to help Him in the work of His Godhead.
  - This sentence negates their false creeds, saying: He does not stand in need of any gods and saints in order to delegate to them the different departments of His Godhead or make them governors in different parts of His kingdom.
