**Ayat 31 - 40**

## Ayat 31

- `(vii) Do not kill your children for fear of want.`
- `We will provide for them and for you.`
- `Surely killing them is a great sin.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse cuts at the very root of the movement of birth control, which has been going on from ancient times to our present age. It was the fear of want that induced people to kill their children or resort to abortion. 
  - In our age another plan has been added to these, i.e. **contraception**.
  - This article of the Islamic manifesto prohibits the people from reducing the number of mouths by artificial means but exhorts them to increase the means of production according to the natural methods enjoined by Allah. According to this article, it is one of the biggest mistakes of man to **check birth rate as a solution to the want and scarcity of provisions**.
  - Therefore, it warns him, as if to say: O man, it is not you who make arrangement for food, but Allah, Who settled you in the land and has been providing for you and will provide for those who will come after you.
  - History tells us that the food resources have always expanded in proportion to the number of inhabitants of a country. Nay, often they have exceeded far more than the needs of the inhabitants. Thus it is a folly on the part of man to interfere with the arrangements of Allah.

## Ayat 32

- `(viii) Do not even approach fornication for it is an outrageous act, and an evil way.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “And do not come near to adultery”.
  - This commandment is meant both for individuals and society as a whole. It warns each individual not only to guard against adultery or fornication itself but against all those things that lead to or stimulate it. As regards to society as a whole the commandment enjoins it to make such arrangements as prevent adultery and eradicate the means and stimulants that lead to adultery.
  - Therefore, the society should employ all those legal and educative means that help develop such an environment as prevents and eradicates indecency.

## Ayat 33

- `(ix) Do not kill any person whom Allah has forbidden to kill,1`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “And do not kill a person” includes not only the prohibition of the killing of other souls but also his own soul as well for it is also included in the prohibition that immediately follows this command.
    - **Thus suicide is regarded as heinous a sin as murder.**
    - Some foolish people object to the prohibition of suicide saying that they themselves are the masters of their souls. Therefore, there is nothing wrong in killing one’s own self or in destroying one’s own property.
    - They forget that every soul belongs to Allah, and none has any right to destroy it, nay, even to abuse it.
    - For this world is a place of trial, where we should undergo the test up to the end of our lives in accordance with the will of Allah.
    - It does not matter whether our circumstances are favorable or adverse for trial.
    - Therefore, it would be wrong to run away from the place of test, not to speak of committing such a heinous crime as suicide (which Allah has prohibited) to escape it. For it means that the one who commits suicide tries to run away from small troubles and ignominies towards greater affliction and eternal torment and ignominy.
- `except with right.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - When the Islamic state was established, “killing by right” was confined to five cases only, namely to punish,
      1. A willful murderer for retribution.
      2. Opponents of the true religion during war.
      3. Those who attempt to overthrow the Islamic system of government.
      4. A man or woman guilty of adultery.
      5. An apostate.
- `We have granted the heir of him who has been wrongfully killed the authority to (claim retribution);`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - We have translated the Arabic word sultan as “the authority of retribution”.
    - Here it stands for “a ground for legal action”.
    - This also lays down the legal principle that in a case of murder, the real plaintiff is not the government but the guardian or the guardians of the murdered person who are authorized to pardon the murderer or receive blood money instead of taking his life.
- `so let him not exceed in slaying.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Exceed limits in killing would be to kill more persons than the murderer or to kill the criminal by degrees with torment or to disfigure his dead body or to kill him after receiving blood money, etc. All these things have been forbidden.
- `He shall be helped.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It has not been defined how succor will be given because at the time of its revelation the Islamic state had not yet been established. After its establishment it was made clear that a guardian was not authorized to enforce retribution by murdering the criminal. The Islamic government alone is legally authorized to take retribution; therefore, succor for justice should be demanded only from it.

## Ayat 34

- `(x) And do not even go near the property of the orphan - except that it be in the best manner - till he attains his maturity.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This too, was not merely a moral instruction. When the Islamic state was established, legal and administrative methods were adopted to safeguard the rights of orphans, the details of which are found in the literature of Hadith and Fiqh.
    - Then this principle was extended to cover the cases of all those citizens who were unable to safeguard their own rights.
    - The Prophet (peace be upon him) himself declared: I am the guardian of the one who has no guardian. And this is the basis of many rules and regulations of the Islamic law.
- `(xi) And fulfil the covenant, for you will be called to account regarding the covenant.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Fulfillment of pledges was not meant to be merely a moral instruction for individuals but afterwards when the Islamic state was established, this became the guiding principle for the conduct of all internal; and external affairs by the Muslim community and the Islamic government.

## Ayat 35

- `(xii) Give full measure when you measure, and weigh with even scales.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This instruction was not confined to individuals only but it has been made a part of the duties of an Islamic government to supervise transactions in the markets and streets to see that exact measures and weights are being observed, and prevent their breach and violation by the force of law.
    - Afterwards it was made one of the duties of the government to eradicate dishonesty in all commercial dealings and economic transactions.
- `That is fair and better in consequence.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, its end will be best in this world and it will be best in the Hereafter.
    - It is best in this world because it produces mutual trust between sellers and buyers. As a result of this, commerce prospers and there is a general prosperity.
    - As regards the Hereafter, there the end depends entirely on honesty, piety and fear of God.

## Ayat 36

- `(xiii) Do not follow that of which you have no knowledge.`
- `Surely the hearing, the sight, the heart - each of these shall be called to account.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The meanings of “Do not follow that of which you have no knowledge” are very comprehensive.
  - It demands that both in individual and collective life, one should not follow mere guess work and presumption instead of knowledge.
  - This instruction covers all aspects of Islamic life, moral, legal, political, administrative and applies to science, arts and education.
  - It has thus saved the society from numerous evils which are produced in human life by following guesswork instead of knowledge.
  - The Islamic moral code demands: Guard against suspicion and do not accuse any individual or group without proper investigation.
  - In law, it has been made a permanent principle that no action should be taken against anyone without proper investigation.
  - It has been made unlawful to arrest, beat or imprison anyone on mere suspicion during investigation.
  - In regards to foreign relations, the definite policy has been laid down that no action should be taken without investigation, nor should rumors be set afloat.
  - Likewise in education the so called sciences based on mere guess work, presumptions and irrational theories have been disapproved.
  - Above all, it cuts at the very root of superstitions, for this instruction teaches the believers to accept only that which is based on the knowledge imparted by Allah and His Messenger.

## Ayat 37

- `(xiv) Do not strut about in the land arrogantly.`
- `Surely you cannot cleave the earth, nor reach the heights of the mountains in stature.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This instruction warns against the ways of tyrants and vain people and is not merely meant for the individual but also for the collective conduct of the Muslim community.
  - It was because of this guidance that the rulers, governors and commanders of the Islamic state which was established on the basis of this manifesto, were free from every tinge of tyranny, arrogance, haughtiness, pride and vanity, so much so that even in the battlefield they never uttered a word which had the slightest indication of any of these vain things.
  - Their gait, dress, dwelling and conveyance showed humility.
  - In short, their ways of conduct were not those of big ones but those of humble persons.
  - That is why they never tried to overawe the people of a conquered city by show of pomp and pride.

## Ayat 38

- `The wickedness of each of that is hateful to your Lord.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, Allah disapproves of the commission of anything that has been prohibited or, in other words, He disapproves of disobedience to any of these commandments.

## Ayat 39

- `That is part of the wisdom your Lord has revealed to you.`
- `So do not set up any deity beside Allah lest you are cast into Hell, rebuked and deprived of every good.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Though this has been addressed to the Prophet (peace be upon him), the real addressee is every human being as in the case of many such verses.

## Ayat 40

- `What, has your Lord favoured you with sons and has taken for Himself daughters from among the angels?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Please refer to( Ayats 57-59 and their E.Ns).
- `You are indeed uttering a monstrous lie.`
