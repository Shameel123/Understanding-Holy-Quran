**Ayat 85 - 93**

- `They ask you about "the spirit".`
- `Say:`
  - `"The spirit descends by the command of my Lord, but you have been given only a little knowledge."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It is generally understood that the Arabic word Rooh stands here for soul as if the people asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) about the soul of man in regard to its nature, and the answer was that it came by the command of Allah.
  - But we have great hesitation in accepting this meaning for it could be taken only if the verse be isolated from its context; otherwise these words would become quite incoherent for there is no reason why the question about soul should have intervened between the preceding three verses and following verses which deal with the theme of the Quran.


## Ayat 86

- `Had We willed,`
- `We could take away what We have revealed to you,`
- `then you would find none to help you in recovering it from Us.`

## Ayat 87

- `(Whatever you have received) is nothing but grace from your Lord.`
- `Indeed His favour to you is great.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Though these words are apparently addressed by the Prophet (peace be upon him), they are in fact meant for the disbelievers who considered the Quran to be either the invention of the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself or of some other man, who secretly taught him the Quran. 
  - They are being told that this is the Word of Allah, as if to say: Our Prophet has not fabricated the Quran but We have bestowed this on him, and if We take it back from him, the Prophet has no power to invent such a thing nor has any other man the power to help the Prophet to present such a miraculous Book.

## Ayat 88

- `Say:`
  - `"Surely, if mankind and jinn were to get together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they will never be able to produce the like of it, howsoever they might help one another."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This challenge occurs at several other places in the Quran:`
    - (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 23);
    - (Surah Younus, Ayats 38-39);
    - (Surah Al-Momin, Ayats 13-14);
    - Surah At-Toor, Ayats 33-34).
  - At all these places, this has been cited as an answer to the charge of the disbelievers that Muhammad (peace be upon him) has himself invented the Quran but is presenting it as Allah’s Word.
  - Besides this, the same has also been refuted in (Surah Younus, Ayat 16):
    - **“Say also, had not Allah willed that I should recite the Quran to you, I could not have recited it to you, nor could I have been able to give you any information about it: already have I lived a lifetime among you before its revelation. Do you not use your common sense?”**

## Ayat 89

- `We have explained things for people in this Qur'an in diverse ways to make them understand the Message,`
- `yet most people obstinately persist in unbelief.`

## Ayat 90

- `They said:`
  - `"We shall not accept your Message until you cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth;`

## Ayat 91

- `or that there be a garden of palms and vines for you and then you cause rivers to abundantly flow forth through them;`

## Ayat 92

- `or cause the sky to fall on us in pieces as you claimed,`
- `or bring Allah and the angels before us, face to face;`

## Ayat 93

- `or that there come to be for you a house of gold, or that you ascend to the sky - though we shall not believe in your ascension (to the sky) - until you bring down a book for us that we can read."`
- `Say to them, (O Muhammad):`   
  - `"Holy is my Lord! Am I anything else than a human being, who bears a Message (from Allah)?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the second answer to the demand of the disbelievers for a miracle.
  - The first answer is contained in (Ayat 59).
  - The eloquence of this concise answer is above praise: You demand from me that I should cause a spring to gush forth, or in the twinkling of an eye should bring into being a garden in full bloom with canals flowing in it: or I should cause the heaven to fall into pieces on those of you who are rejecting the message: or I should cause to build a furnished palace of gold: or I should call Allah and the angels to stand before you and testify to this effect: We Ourselves have sent down Muhammad as Our Messenger: or I should go up to the sky in your presence and bring down, addressed to you, the letter of authority of my appointment duly signed by Allah so that you may touch it with your hands and read it with your own eyes.
  - The concise answer to these big demands was this: My Lord be glorified! Have I ever claimed to be anything more than a human Messenger? It may be expanded like this: O people, have I claimed to be God that you are demanding such things from me? Did I ever say that I am all powerful and am ruling over the earth and the Heavens? From the very first day my claim has been that I am a human being who is bringing the Message from God. Therefore, if you want to judge the authenticity of my claim, you may judge it from my message. If you are convinced that it is based on the truth and is absolutely rational, then you should believe in it without making foolish demands. On the other hand, if you find any defect in it, you may reject it. If you want to test whether my claim is based on truth, you should judge it by the standard of my conduct and morals as a human being and my mission.
  - Is it not a folly that, instead of this, you are demanding from me to cleave the earth and cause the sky to fall? Is there any connection whatsoever of Prophethood with things like that.
