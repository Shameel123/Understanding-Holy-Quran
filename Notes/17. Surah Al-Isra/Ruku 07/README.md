**Ayat 61 - 70**

- `And recall when We asked the angels to prostrate themselves before Adam; all prostrated themselves except Iblis,2 who said:`
  - `"Shall I prostrate myself before him whom You created of clay?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Please also refer to
    - (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayats 30-39);
    - (Surah An-Nisa, Ayats 117-122);
    - (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 11- 25);
    - (Surah Ibrahim, Ayat 22);
    - (Surah Al-Hijr, Ayats 26-43).
  - This story has been cited here to impress upon the disbelievers that their attitude of arrogance and indifference towards Allah is exactly the same as was adopted by Satan.
  - As a matter of fact, they were following Satan who is the avowed enemy of man, and were being entangled in the snare spread by him who had challenged the progeny of Adam at the very beginning of human history that he would allure and ruin them.

## Ayat 62

- `He then continued:`
  - `"Look! This is he whom You have exalted above me!`
  - `If you will grant me respite till the Day of Resurrection I shall uproot the whole of his progeny except only a few."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, I will uproot them from the high position of divine vicegerency which demands steadfastness in obedience.
  - Their removal from that high position is just like the tearing of a tree from its roots.

## Ayat 63

- `Thereupon He retorted:`
  - `"Be gone! Hell shall be the recompense - and a most ample one - of whosoever of them who follows you.`

## Ayat 64

- `Tempt with your call all whom you wish.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The literal meaning of the Arabic text is: You may sweep away those whom you find superficial and weak minded.
- `Muster against them all your forces - your cavalry and your foot soldiers;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here, Satan has been likened to that robber who assaults a habitation with cavalry and infantry and orders them to rob. The cavalry and the infantry of Satan are those jinns and human beings who are engaged in numerous forms and positions in carrying out his mission.
- `share with them riches and offspring,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is a very meaningful sentence which depicts a true and perfect picture of the relationship between Satan and his followers. 
    - On the one hand, Satan becomes a partner with the one who follows him in the earning and spending of his money without putting in any labor in it.
    - On the other hand, he does not become a partner in bearing the consequences of his error, crime and sin.
    - But his foolish dupe follows his instructions as if he were a partner, nay, a stronger party.
    - Again in regard to the children of such a man, the father himself bears the whole burden of bringing them up, but under the misguidance of Satan he trains them in wrong and unmoral ways as if he alone was not their father but Satan as well was a partner in it.
- `and seduce them with rosy promises - and Satan's promise is nothing but a deception -`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Satan entices them with false promises of success and entangles them in the snare of false expectations.

## Ayat 65

- `but know well that you will have no power against My servants.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It has two meanings:
      1. You will have no power over human beings to force them to follow your way. What you are allowed to do is that you may delude them by false counsel and entice them by false promises, but they will have the option to follow or not to follow your counsel. You will not have the power over them to force them to follow your way against their will.
      2. You will not succeed in alluring My righteous people. Though the weak minded will be enticed by you. My righteous people who are steadfast in My obedience will not succumb to you.
- `Your Lord suffices for them to place their trust in."`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, those who will trust in Allah and believe in His guidance and help, will not stand in need of any other support in their trial by Satan for Allah will guide them, protect them and help them to be safe from his allurements.
    - On the other hand, those people, who will place their trust in their own power or that of any other than Allah, will not come out successful in their trial by Satan.

## Ayat 66

- `Your Lord is He Who steers your vessels across the seas`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This passage (Ayats 66-72) is closely connected with the previous one.
    - It tells man that if he wants to protect himself from the allurements, temptations and false promises of Satan who has been his avowed enemy from the day of his creation, he should recognize his real Lord and be steadfast in His obedience.
    - Satan intends to prove that man is not worthy of the honor with which Allah has blessed him.
    - Therefore if he follows any other way he cannot escape the snares of Satan.
- `that you may seek of His Bounty.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this passage, arguments of Tauhid have been put forward in order to make man steadfast in his faith and refrain from shirk.
- `He is ever Merciful towards you.`

## Ayat 67

- `When a calamity befalls you on the sea, all those whom you invoke forsake you except Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, this is a proof of the fact that your real nature knows no other Lord than Allah, and you feel in the depths of your hearts that He alone possesses the real power of every gain or loss.
    - Had it not been so, man would never have invoked Allah at the time when he realized that no other helper could remove his misfortune.
- `But when He delivers you safely to the shore you turn away from Him, for man is indeed most thankless.`

## Ayat 68

- `Do you, then, feel secure against`
- `His causing you to be swallowed up by a tract of the earth,`
- `or letting loose a deadly whirlwind charged with stones towards you,`
- `and there you will find none to protect you?`

## Ayat 69

- `Or do you feel secure that`
- `He will not cause you to revert to the sea, and let a tempest loose upon you and then drown you for your ingratitude`
- `whereupon you will find none even to inquire of Us what happened to you?`

## Ayat 70

- `Indeed,`
- `We honoured the progeny of Adam,`
- `and bore them across land and sea`
- `and provided them with good things for their sustenance,`
- `and exalted them above many of Our creatures.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, it is an obvious fact that the superiority man enjoys over all other beings on the earth and all that is in it, has not been bestowed upon him by a jinn or an angel or a prophet.
  - Most surely that is Allahâ€™s blessing and favor.
  - Is it not then the height of folly and ignorance that after having achieved such a high rank, man should bow down before any creature of Allah instead of Him?
