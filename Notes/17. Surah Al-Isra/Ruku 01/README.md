**Ayat 01 - 10**

## Ayat 01

- `Holy is He Who carried His servant by night from the Holy Mosque (in Makkah) to the farther Mosque (in Jerusalem) whose surroundings We have blessed that We might show him some of Our Signs.`
- **`Indeed He alone is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The event referred to in this verse is known Miraj and Isra. 
  - According to authentic traditions, this took place a year before Hijrah.
  - In the traditional and biographical literature, its details have been related by a large number (25) of the companions.
  - Anas bin Malik, Malik bin Saasaah, Abuzar Ghifari, and Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with them all) have related details of the event. Besides them, Umar, Ali, Abdullah bin Masud (Allah be pleased with them) have also related some parts of this event.

## Ayat 02

- `We gave Moses the Book, and made it a source of guidance for the Children of Israel,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - As this verse has no apparent connection with the event of Miraj, it may appear to a cursory reader that either of the two verses has been misplaced here.
    - But if we try to understand the matter in the context of the theme of the whole Surah, we can easily understand the connection between the two.
    - **The main object of this Surah is to give a warning to the disbelievers of Makkah.**
    - That is why the mention of Miraj has been made in the very first verse, as if to say: The person whom you dub as an impostor and reject the Book sent down to him, has just now seen with his naked eyes great signs of Allah. So you should learn a lesson from the history of the Israelites who discarded the Book of Allah and therefore, were given painful punishment.
- `commanding:`
  - `"Take no other Guardian beside Me."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The Arabic word vakil (guardian) denotes a person who is trustworthy and can be depended upon in regard to his affairs and may be turned to for guidance and help.

## Ayat 03

- `You are the descendants of those whom We carried (in the Ark) with Noah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you are the descendants of Noah (peace be upon him) and his companions; therefore, you should behave in a manner as behooves such people. You should make Allah alone as your Guardian, for your ancestors escaped death from the flood only because they had made Allah their Guardian.
- `He was truly a thankful servant.`

## Ayat 04

- `Then We clearly declared to the Children of Israel in the Book:`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The original Arabic word Al-kitab does not stand here for the Torah but for all the divine Books.
- `"Twice you will make mischief in the land and will commit transgression."`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Such warnings have been given in different Books of the Bible.
    - As regards to their first mischief and its evil consequences, the Israelites were warned in the Psalms, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel and the warnings about their second mischief and its severe punishments are found in Matthew and Luke.
    - Given below are some extracts to confirm this statement of the Quran.

## Ayat 05

- `So, when the occasion for the first of the transgressions arrived,`
- `We raised against you some of Our creatures who were full of might, and they ran over the whole of your land.`
- `This was a promise that was bound to be fulfilled.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This refers to the terrible destruction that the Israelites suffered at the hands of the Assyrians and Babylonians.
  - One cannot fully appreciate the historical background of this merely from the extracts that have been reproduced above from the Books of the Prophets.
  - A brief history of the Israelites is also needed so that a student may become acquainted with all the causes and circumstances on account of which Allah removed this nation, that professed to believe in a revealed Book, from the leadership of mankind and turned it into a humiliated, condemned and backward community.

## Ayat 06

- `Then We granted you an upper hand against them,`
- `and strengthened you with wealth and children,`
- `and multiplied your numbers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This refers to the lease of time that the Israelites (That is the people of Judah) got after their release from the captivity of Babylon.
  - As for the people of Israel and Samaria, they did not rise again after their moral and spiritual degeneration.
  - But among the people of Judah there still were some people who practiced the truth and invited others also to follow it.
  - They carried on their work of invitation to the truth among the remaining Israelites in Judah and also exhorted those who had been driven out into Babylon and other lands to repent and follow the truth.
  - At last the mercy of Allah came to their help.
    - The downfall of Babylon started.
  - The Persian king, Cyrus, took Babylon in 539 B.C. and in the following year issued a decree allowing the Israelites to return to and resettle in their homeland. The Israelites began to return home in caravan after caravan, and this continued for a long time. Cyrus also allowed the Israelites to rebuild the Temple of Solomon but the neighboring communities who had settled in this land resisted it. At last Darfius appointed Zerubbabel, a grandson of the last king of Judah as the governor of Judah in 522 B.C., who got the Temple rebuilt under the care of Prophet Haggai, Prophet Zechariah and Joshua.
  - In 458 B.C. Ezra arrived in Judah along with an exiled group and the Persian king Artaxerxes made the following decree:

## Ayat 07

- `Whenever you did good, it was to your own advantage; and whenever you committed evil, it was to your own disadvantage.`
- `So, when the time of the fulfilment of the second promise arrived, (We raised other enemies that would) disfigure your faces and enter the Temple (of Jerusalem) as they had entered the first time, and destroy whatever they could lay their hands on.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The historical background of the second degeneration and its chastisement is as follows:
    - The moral and religious fervor with which the Maccabees had started their movement gradually cooled down and was replaced by love of the world and empty external form.
    - A split appeared among them and they themselves invited the Roman General, Pompey, to come to Palestine.
    - Pompey turned his attention to this land in 63 B.C. By taking Jerusalem he put an end to the political freedom of the Jews. But the Roman conquerors preferred to rule their dominions through the agency of the local chiefs rather than by direct control.
    - Therefore, a local government was set up in Palestine which eventually passed into the hand of Herod, a clever Jew, in 40 B.C. 
    - This ruler is well known as Herod the Great. He ruled over the entire Palestine and Jordan from 40 to 4 B.C. On the one hand, Herod patronized the religious leaders to please the Jews, and on the other, he propagated the Roman culture and won the goodwill of Caesar by showing his loyalty and faithfulness to the Roman Empire. 
    - During, his reign, the Jews degenerated and fell to the lowest ebb of moral and religious life.

## Ayat 08

- `Your Lord may well show Mercy to you,`
- `but if you revert to your evil behaviour, We shall revert to chastising you.`
- `We have made Hell a prison for those who are thankless of Allah's bounties.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Though this admonition has been given as a parenthesis at the end of the address to the children of Israel, it does not mean that this and the address itself are solely meant for them.
  - As a matter of fact, the whole address is really directed towards the disbelievers of Makkah but, instead of addressing them directly, some important historical events from the history of the children of Israel have been cited in order to serve as admonition for them.

## Ayat 09

- `Verily this Qur'an guides to the Way that is the Straight most.`
- `To those who believe in it, and do righteous works,`
- `it gives the good news that a great reward awaits them,`

## Ayat 10

- `and warns those who do not believe in the Hereafter that We have prepared for them a grievous chastisement.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This means to warn those persons or people or nations who do not take a lesson from the admonitions of the Quran to be ready to undergo that chastisement which Israelites had to suffer.
