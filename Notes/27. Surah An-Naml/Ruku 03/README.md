**Ayat 32 - 44**

## Ayat 32

- `(After reading the letter) the Queen said:`
  - `"Nobles, let me have your counsel in this matter for I make no firm decision without you."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The words used in the text are: hatta tash-hu-dun (until you are present, or unless you bear witness). That is: **“I regard your presence necessary when I take a decision in important matters, and also that whatever decision I take you should be there to testify that it is right and correct.”**
  - This shows that though the system of government among Saba was kingship, it was not tyrannical; but the ruler of the time decided matters in consultation with the important people in the government.

## Ayat 33

- `They said:`
  - `"We are strong and are given to vehement fighting. But the decision is yours. Therefore, consider what you would like to command."`

## Ayat 34

- `The Queen said:`
  - `"When the kings enter a country they cause corruption in it and abase those of its people who are held in honour.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - In this one sentence a thorough criticism has been made of imperialism. The kings’ invasion of the other countries and the victorious nations’ violence against the oppressed nations has never been for the sake of reform and goodwill. The object has been to control and exploit the means and resources of sustenance granted to the other nation by God, and make it so helpless that it should never be able to rise in resistance and demand its share. For this purpose they block up all its means of prosperity, power and honor, crush down all self respecting elements, instill in its members attitudes of slavery, flattery, treachery and spying against one another, imitation of the conqueror and respect for his civilization, contempt of their own civilization and other such mean qualities of character. Thus, gradually they bring them down to such a low level of character where they may not hesitate even to sell off any of their most sacred objects of heritage and be ready to perform any wretched service on payment.
  - `This is what they are wont to do.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This sentence has two meanings and both are equally probable:
        1. It may be a part of the queen of Sheba’s speech, which she might have added in order to emphasize her foregoing words;
        2. it may be Allah's words which have been added as a parenthesis in support of the queen's speech.


## Ayat 35

- `I will send them a gift and then see with what answer my envoys return."`

## Ayat 36

- `Now, when (the envoy of the Queen) came to Solomon, he said:`
  - `"Do you want to aid me with wealth? Whatever Allah has granted me is much more than what He has given you. (Keep for yourselves) your gift in which you are exulting.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This sentence is not meant to express pride and vanity. What it means to say is this: **“I have no desire for your wealth; I only desire that you should believe, or at least submit to a righteous system. If you agree to neither of these alternatives, it is not possible for me to accept the bribes of wealth and leave you free in the matter of a polytheistic and wicked system of life. What my Lord has given me is enough for me to cherish any desire for your wealth.**

## Ayat 37

- `Envoy, go back to those who sent you and we shall certainly come upon them with hosts whom they will be unable to resist. We shall drive them out from there, and they will suffer humiliation and disgrace."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There is a subtle gap between this and the previous sentence, which one can easily fill up by a careful study of the discourse. It means this: **“O messengers, take these gift back to the people who have sent you. They will either have to yield to our first proposal, i.e. they should come before us as Muslims, or we shall bring forces against them.”**

## Ayat 38

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The details of the story that have been omitted are to the effect. The envoys returned to the queen with the gift and made a report of what they had seen and heard. The queen decided on the basis of what she heard about the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) to make a visit to Jerusalem to see him personally. She left Saba for Palestine accompanied by her royal entourage and sent a message to Solomon’s court that she was coming to personally hear the invitation from the king and to have a direct talk with him. Here, the story is resumed from the time when the queen had reached near Jerusalem and was going to appear before Solomon (peace be upon him) in a day or two.

- `Solomon said:`
  - `"My nobles, which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?"`

## Ayat 39

- `A stalwart of the jinn said:`
  - `"I will bring it to you before you rise from your council.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - From this it becomes obvious whether the jinns under the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) were, according to the interpretation of some rationalist commentators of the modern times, from among mankind or from among the hidden creation commonly known as jinns. Obviously, the sitting of the Prophet Solomon's court would at the most be of three to four hours, and the distance of Marib, capital of Saba, from Jerusalem was, even as the crow flies, not less than *1500 miles*. To fetch a splendid throne of a queen from such a distant place in such a short time could not be possible for a man, even if he be a very strong and robust person. This task cannot be performed even by a jet plane of today. The throne was not lying in a jungle from where it had just to be fetched. It lay in a queen’s palace, which must have been well-guarded, and in the absence of the queen it must have been kept in a secure place. If a man had gone to fetch it, he should have been accompanied by a commando force so that he could overwhelm the guards and snatch away the throne. How could all this be accomplished before the rising of the court? This thing can be conceived only in connection with a real jinn!
  - `Surely I have the power to do so and I am trustworthy."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, “You can trust me in that I will not carry it away, nor steal any valuable thing from it.”

## Ayat 40

- `And he who had some knowledge of the Book said:`
  - `"I will bring it before the twinkling of your eye."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Nothing is known with certainty as to who this person was, what special knowledge he had and what book is referred to here, the knowledge of which he had. No explanation of these things has been given either in the Quran or in any authentic Hadith. Some of the commentators say that it was an angel, others say that it was a man. Then they differ as to the identity of the man. Someone mentions the name of Asaf bin Barchiah, who, according to the rabbinical traditions, was the Prince of Men. Someone says that he was Khidr, someone mentions some other name, and Imam Razi insists that it was the Prophet Solomon himself. But none of these has any reliable source for this information, and Imam Razi's opinion does not even fit in with the Quranic context. Likewise, about the book also the commentators differ. Someone says that it refers to Lauh-i-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet) and some other takes it for the Book of Law. But all this is mere guess work. Similar guesses have been made about the knowledge the man had from the book. We only know and believe what has been said in the Quran, or what becomes evident from its words. In any case the person was not from among the jinns, and possibly he was a man. He possessed some extraordinary knowledge, which had been derived from some Divine Book (al-Kitab). The jinn had claimed to fetch the throne within a few hours by means of his physical strength; this man fetched it in a moment by the power of his knowledge.
- `When Solomon saw the throne placed firmly beside him, he cried out:`
  - `"This is by the grace of my Lord so that He may test me whether I give thanks for (His Bounty) or act with ingratitude.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The words of the Quran are very clear in this regard. This person’s claim did not remain a claim like the jinn’s, but, in fact, as soon as he made the claim the throne was seen placed before the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) the next moment. Just consider these words:
  - `Whoever is grateful is so to his own good; and whoever is ungrateful, let him know that my Lord is Immensely Resourceful, Most Bountiful."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - “I will bring it to you before that your gaze returns to you. Then when he saw it placed before him.”


## Ayat 41

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - As to how the queen reached Jerusalem and how she was received, has been omitted. The story is resumed from the time when she had arrived at the palace to see Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him)

- `Solomon said:`
  - `"Set the throne before her casually, and let us see whether she gets to the Truth or is one of those who are not guided to what is right."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is a meaningful sentence, which means:
    1. “Whether she understands or not that it is her own throne which has been fetched in no time from her capital to distant place like Jerusalem;” and also
    2. “whether she is guided aright after seeing this wonderful miracle, or persists in her error.” This refutes the wrong idea of the people who say that the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) intended to take possession of the throne. Here he himself clearly says that he had done this in order to help the queen see guidance.

## Ayat 42

- `When the Queen arrived, she was asked:`
  - `"Is your throne like this one?"`
- `She said:`
  - `"It seems as if it is the same.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This also refutes the speculations of those people who depict the event in a manner as though the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) wanted to have a throne made for the queen and for this purpose he invited tenders and a strong robust artisan offered to make him a throne in the matter of a few hours, but an expert craftsman submitted that he could make and produce it in no time.
      - This whole guess-work is destroyed by the fact that Solomon (peace be upon him) himself ordered the throne to be fetched before him (Ayat 38), and when it had been fetched, ordered his servants to set it before the queen casually (Ayat 41), and then when she arrived, she was asked whether her throne was like that (Ayat 42), and she answered, “(It is) as though it were the very one.” Obviously, there could he no room for the absurd interpretations in the face of such a clear statement of facts. If there is still any doubt left, it can be satisfied by the next sentence.
  - `We had already come to know this and we had submitted ourselves."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, **“Even before we saw this miracle, we had been convinced by what we had heard of Solomon (peace be upon him) that he was a Prophet of Allah, and not merely a ruler of a kingdom.”**
      - After seeing the throne and saying, **“(It is) as though it were the very one”**, what could be the relevance of adding this sentence if it is supposed that the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) had gotten a throne manufactured and set the same before her? Even if it is assumed that no effort was spared to have a throne manufactured closely resembling that of queen’s throne, what could have made a sun-worshiping queen exclaim **“We had already known this and we had become Muslims!”**

## Ayat 43

- `What prevented her (from accepting the True Faith) was her worshipping deities other than Allah, for she belonged to an unbelieving people.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This sentence has been added by Allah to clarity the queen’s position, saying that she was not obdurate and stubborn. She had been an unbeliever till then mainly because she came of an unbelieving people. As she had become accustomed to bowing down before a false deity since her childhood, it had become a hindrance for her to the right way. As soon as she came in contact with the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him), she discerned the right way and the hindrance was removed forthwith.


## Ayat 44

- `She was told:`
  - `"Enter the palace."`
- `But when she saw it, she thought it was a pool of water and she bared both her calves (to enter into it).`
- `Solomon said:`
  - `"This is a slippery floor of crystal."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This was the last thing that opened queen’s eyes.
        1. The first thing was Solomon’s (peace be upon him) letter that began with the name of the All-Compassionate, the All- Merciful Allah, a way different front the common custom prevalent among the kings.
        2. The second was his rejection of her gifts, which made the queen understand that he was a different kind of king.
        3. The third was the report made by the queen’s envoys from which she came to know about Solomon's pious life, his wisdom and his message of the truth. This very thing had induced her to travel to Jerusalem to personally meet the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him), and to this she had referred when she said: **“and we had surrendered (to Allah)”**.
        4. The fourth thing was the removal of her throne from Marib to Jerusalem in no time, from which the queen realized that he had Allah’s power with him. Now this was the last thing that removed every doubt from her mind regarding the unique and great personality of the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him).
      - When she saw that in spite of possessing every means of comfort and ease and a grand palace for a dwelling, he was so free from every conceit, so God-fearing and righteous and so grateful to God that he bowed before Him for every small favor and his life was so different from the life of those who were enamored of the world, she exclaimed the words that follow.
- `Thereupon she cried out:`
  - **`"My Lord, I have been inflicting much wrong on myself. Now I submit myself with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the whole Universe."`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This story of the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) and the queen of Sheba has been related in the Old and the New Testaments and the Israelite traditions in different ways, but the Quranic narration differs from all others. A resume of the story as given in the Old Testament is as follows:
