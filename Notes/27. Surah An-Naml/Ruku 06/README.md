**Ayat 67 - 82**

## Ayat 67

- `The unbelievers say:`
  - `"When we become dust, we and our forefathers, shall we really be brought out (from our graves)?`

## Ayat 68

- `We were told about this and so were our forefathers before us.`
- `But these are no more than fairy tales that have been recounted from ancient times."`

## Ayat 69

- `Say:`
  - `"Go about through the earth and see what has been the end of the evil-doers."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This brief sentence contains two strong arguments for the Hereafter as well as admonition:

## Ayat 70

- `(O Prophet), do not grieve over them, nor be distressed at their designs.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “You have done full justice to your mission of preaching. Now if they do not listen to you, and wish to persist in their folly and deserve the Divine torment, you should not consume yourself by being distressed and grieved at their condition. Then, why should you feel vexed at their mean machinations that they are devising in order to fight the truth and to frustrate your movement of return? You have Allah’s power at your back. If they do not listen to you, they will only be harming themselves, not you.”

## Ayat 71

- `They also say:`
  - `"Tell us when this threat will come to pass, if you are truthful."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The same threat which is implied in the preceding verse. What they meant was: “When will the scourge with which you threaten us overtake us? Why are we not being punished when we have not only rejected you but have also done whatever we could to frustrate your mission?”

## Ayat 72

- `Say:`
  - `"The chastisement whose hastening you have been asking for, maybe a part of it has drawn quite near to you."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is a royal way of saying a thing. When words like “may be”, “perhaps”, “no wonder”, etc. occur in the Divine discourse, they do not contain any sense of doubt, but express Allah’s Independence and Self-Sufficiency.
  - Allah’s power is so great that His willing a thing and its happening is one and the same thing. It is inconceivable that He should will a thing and it should not happen. Therefore, when He says, “No wonder it may well be so”, it means, “It will certainly be so if you do not mend your ways.”

## Ayat 73

- **`Indeed Your Lord is exceedingly bountiful to mankind.`**
- **`Yet most of them do not give thanks.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “It is Allah's mercy that He does not seize the culprit immediately after his commission of a crime but gives him respite to reform himself. But most people are not grateful for this, and do not utilize the period of respite for their reformation. On the contrary, when they see that they have not been taken to task immediately, they form the idea that there is none to call them to account. Therefore, they are free to do whatever they like and they should not listen to any word of admonition”.

## Ayat 74

- **`Verily your Lord knows all that their hearts conceal as well as all that they reveal.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “He is not only aware of their open misdeeds but is also fully aware of the malice and spite which they are concealing in their hearts and the evil plots which they are making secretly. Therefore, when the time comes to call them to account, they will be taken to task for everything done and thought.”

## Ayat 75

- **`There is nothing that is hidden - be it in the heaven or the earth - but is recorded in a Clear Book.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here by “Record” is not meant the Quran, but the Divine Record in which everything has been registered.

## Ayat 76

- `Surely this Qur'an explains to the Children of Israel most of the matters concerning which they have disagreements`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This sentence is connected with the foregoing theme as well as with what follows.
  - In the first case, it means that it is a manifestation of the knowledge of the All-Knowing God that He is explaining through a gentile (non-Jew) in this Quran the reality of those events which are a part of the Israelite history, and which are being disputed by the learned men of the Israelites themselves.
  - In the second case, it means that just as Allah has decided those disputes, so He will decide this dispute also which is going on between the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his opponents as to who is following the truth and who the falsehood. So, a few years after the revelation of these verses the decision came before the whole world. In the same land of Arabia and in the same clan of the Quraish there was no single person left who was not convinced that it was Muhammad (peace be upon him) who was following the truth and not Abu Jahl and Abu Lahab. Even the children of these people admitted that their fathers were wrong.

## Ayat 77

- `and it is a guidance and mercy for the believers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, **“It is mercy and guidance for those who accept the message of the Quran and believe in what it presents. Such people will be saved from the errors in which their own people are involved. They will find the right way of life by means of the Quran and they will be blessed with such favors by Allah, which the disbelievers among the Quraish cannot even imagine today.”**
  - This shower of Allah’s mercy was also witnessed by the world after a few years. The same people who were living unknown lives in a corner of the Arabian desert and could at the most become successful raiders in the state of unbelief, suddenly emerged after their belief in the Quran as the guides of the world, leaders of the nations, makers of human civilization and rulers over a vast part of the world.

## Ayat 78

- `Indeed your Lord will decide between them by His judgement.`
- **`He is All-Mighty, All-Knowing.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Between them”: Between the disbelievers of the Quraish and the believers.

## Ayat 79

- `So put your trust in Allah for you are on the manifest truth.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “Neither can any power withhold His judgment from being enforced, nor is there any chance of an error in His judgment.”

## Ayat 80

- `Surely you cannot make the dead hear you,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “The dead” the ones whose consciences are dead and whose stubbornness, obstinacy and love of the usage and custom have deprived them of the sense of discrimination between the truth and falsehood.
- `nor can you make the deaf hear your call if they turn back in flight,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “Who not only close their ears against what you say, but slink away from the place where they fear they aught hear what you say.”

## Ayat 81

- `nor can you direct the blind to the Right Way, preventing them from falling into error.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “It is none of your job to pull them forcibly to the right way and drag them along with you. You can only tell them by the word of mouth and by your example that this is the right way and the way they are following is the wrong way. But how can you guide the one who has closed his eyes and is not at all inclined to see anything?”
- **`You can make only those who believe in Our verses to hear the call and then submit.`**


## Ayat 82

- `And when the time for the fulfilment of Our Word against them will come,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “When Resurrection which they are being promised will approach.”
- `We shall bring forth for them a beast from the earth who will speak to them because people did not believe in Our Signs.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - According to Ibn Umar, this will happen when there remains no one in the world to command the people to do good and forbid them to do evil.
    - Ibn Marduyah has reported a Hadith on the authority of Abu Said Khudri; according to which the latter heard the same thing from the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself.
    - This shows that when man gives up the duty of exhorting others to do good and forbidding them to do evil, Allah will bring forth a beast to serve as the final warning just before Resurrection. This, however, is not clear whether it will be just one beast, or a particular species of beasts, who will spread all over the earth. The words daabbat-an-min-al-ard might contain both the meanings. In any case, what it will say will be: **“The people did not believe in Allah’s revelations in which Resurrection was foretold. Now the same Resurrection is about to come; let everyone know that what Allah said was true”**.
    - The sentence, **“The people did not believe in Our Revelations”**, is either a part of the beast’s own speech, or Allah’s narration of its words. If these are its own words, the word “Our” will be understood in the style of an official who speaks on behalf of his government and not on his personal behalf. In the second case, since Allah is narrating the beast’s words, He has used “Our Revelations” in the normal sense.
