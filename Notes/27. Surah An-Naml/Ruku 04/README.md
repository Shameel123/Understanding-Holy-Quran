**Ayat 45 - 58**

## Ayat 45

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For comparison, see (Surah Al-Aaraf: Ayats 73-79), (Surah Hud: Ayats 61-68), (Surah Ash-Shuara: Ayats 141- 159), (Surah Al-Qamar: Ayats 23-32), (Surah Ash-Shams: Ayats 11-15).

- `And We sent to Thamud their brother Salih (with the Message):`
  - **`"Serve Allah,"`**
- `but all of a sudden they became split into two quarrelling factions.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, as soon as the Prophet Salih (peace be upon him) embarked on his mission, his people were divined into two groups, **the believers and the disbelievers**, and a conflict started between them as stated elsewhere in the Quran.
  - The chiefs of his tribe, who were full of pride, said to those who had believed from among the oppressed people, **“Do you know it for certain that Salih is a Messenger from his Lord?”** They replied, **“Indeed, we believe in the message with which he has been sent.”** But those who had arrogant assumption of superiority, said, **“We deny that which you believe”**. (Surah Al-Aaraf: Ayats 75-76).
  - One should note that precisely the same situation arose in Makkah at the advent of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The nation was divided into two factions and a conflict started between them. Therefore, this story fully applies to the conditions in which these verses were revealed.

## Ayat 46

- `Salih said:`
  - `"My people, why do you wish to hasten that evil rather than good should come upon you?`
  - `Why should you not seek pardon from Allah so that mercy be shown to you?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “Why do you hasten in asking for a torment instead of some good from Allah?” The following saying of the chiefs of the Prophet Salih’s people has been related at another place: **“O Salih, bring that scourge with which you threaten us, if you really are one of the Messengers.”** (Surah Al-Aaraf: Ayat 77).

## Ayat 47

- `They said:`
  - `"We augur ill of you and those who are with you."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - One meaning of what they said is: **“Your movement has proved to be an evil omen for us. Since you and your companions have revolted against the ancestral religion, one or the other calamity is befalling us almost daily, because our deities have become angry with us.”**
      - In this sense, this saying is similar to the sayings of most of those polytheistic nations who regarded their Prophets as ominous. In **Surah YaSin**, for instance, a nation has been mentioned, which said to its Prophet **“We regard you as an evil omen for ourselves.”** (Ayat 18).
      - The same thing was said by the Pharaoh’s people about the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him). Whenever a good time came, they would say, “This is but our due”, and when there was a bad time, they would ascribe their calamities to Moses and his companions. (Surah Al-Aaraf Ayat 130).
      - Almost similar things were said in Makkah about the Prophet (peace be upon him).
- `Salih replied:`
  - `"Your augury is with Allah. The truth is that you are a people who are being tried."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The other meaning of their saying is this: “Your advent has stirred up divisions in our nation. Before this we were a united people, who followed one religion. Your ominous coming has turned brother against brother, and separated son from father.” This very accusation was being brought against the Prophet (peace be upon him) by his opponents over and over again. Soon after he started his mission of inviting the people to the faith, the delegation of the chiefs of the Quraish, who went to Abu Talib, had said, “Give up to us this nephew of yours: he has opposed your religion and your forefathers’ religion and has sown discord among your people, and has held the whole nation as foolish.”

## Ayat 48

- `Now there were nine ring-leaders in the city`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, nine chiefs of the tribes each of whom had a band of followers with him.
- `who created corruption in the land and never worked to set things right.`

## Ayat 49

- `They said:`
  - `"Swear to one another in the name of Allah that we shall make a sudden night swoop on Salih and his family and will then tell their heirs`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - “The guardian”: the chief of the Prophet Salih’s (peace be upon him) tribe, who, according to the ancient tribal tradition and custom, could make a claim to blood vengeance. The same was the position in Makkah of the Prophet’s uncle (peace be upon him), Abu Talib. The Quraish were hesitant that if they attacked and killed the Prophet (peace be upon him), Abu Talib, the chief of Bani Hashim, would come out with a claim to blood vengeance on behalf of his clan.
  - `that we did not witness the destruction of his family. We are indeed truthful."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This precisely was the kind of plot which the Makkan chiefs of the clans were devising against the Prophet (peace be upon him), and they devised the same ultimately on the occasion of migration (Hijrah) to kill him. 
  - They decided that men from all the clans would attack him in a body so that the Bani Hashim could not hold any one of the clans as responsible for the murder, and, therefore, would find it impossible to fight all of them at one and the same time.

## Ayat 50

- `Thus they planned and We too planned, the while they did not know.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “Before they could make the night attack on the Prophet Salih (peace be upon him) at the appointed time, Allah sent down His scourge which destroyed their whole nation completely. It appears that they made this plot after hamstringing the she-camel. According to (Surah Hud: Ayat 65), when they had killed the she-camel, Prophet Salih (peace be upon him) gave them a notice to enjoy life in their houses for three more days, for then they would be seized by the torment. At this they might have thought that the torment with which Salih (peace be upon him) threatened them might come or might not, but they must take the vengeance on Salih himself. Therefore, most probably they chose the same night for the attack which Allah had appointed for sending down the torment, and thus were struck down by Allah even before they could touch the Prophet Salih (peace be upon him).”

## Ayat 51

- `So see what was the outcome of the plan they made:`
- **`We utterly destroyed them and their people, all of them.`**

## Ayat 52

- `Now behold their houses that lie in utter ruins because of their wrong-doing.`
- `Verily there is a Sign in this for the people who know.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the ignorant people will say, “There is no link between the Prophet Salih (peace be upon him) and his shecamel and the earthquake which struck the people of Thamud. These things have their natural causes. Their occurrence or otherwise has nothing to do with the piety and wickedness of the people of a place, with their highhandedness or their show of mercy. It is meaningless merely to say that such and such a city or land was filled with sin and wickedness, and therefore, it was overwhelmed by flood, or its habitation turned upside down by an earthquake, or it was ruined by a sudden disaster.”
  - But the people who possess knowledge know that this universe is being ruled by an All-Wise, All-Knowing One Who is deciding the destinies. **His decisions are not subject to physical causes, but the physical causes are subject to His will.** His decisions to debase or exalt nations are not taken blindly but with wisdom and justice.
  - In His Book of Law there is also included the principle of retribution, according to which the wicked are made to suffer for their evil deeds even in this world, on moral grounds. The people who are aware of these realities, cannot explain away the occurrence of an earthquake by citing physical and natural causes; they will rather look upon them as the scourge of warning for themselves, and they will learn lessons from it. They will try to understand those moral causes because of which the Creator annihilated a flourishing nation, which He Himself had created. They will divert their conduct and attitude from the track that brings Allah's wrath to the way that joins them to His mercy.

## Ayat 53

- `And We delivered those who believed and were wont to avoid disobeying (Allah).`

## Ayat 54

- `We also sent Lot, and recall when he told his people:`
  - `"Do you commit shameless acts with your eyes open?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This can have several meanings and probably all are implied:
    1. “That you are not unaware of this act’s being wicked, but you commit it knowing it to be so”.
    2. “You are also not unaware that the man has not been created for the man’s sexual desire, but the intimate relationship is between man and woman, and the distinction between them (man and woman) is not such as you cannot perceive, yet with open eyes you commit this abominable act.”
    3. “You indulge in this indecency publicly when there are people watching you”, as stated in(Surah Al-Ankabut: Ayat 29), thus: “And you indulge in indecencies in your assemblies.”

## Ayat 55

- `Do you lustfully approach men instead of women? Nay, you engage in acts of sheer ignorance."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The word jahalat here has been used in the sense of folly and stupidity. But even if it is taken in the sense of ignorance and lack of knowledge, it will mean: “You do not know the evil consequences of your acts. You only know that you are deriving sensual pleasure, but you do not know what severe punishment awaits you for this criminal and heinous pleasure-seeking. The scourge of Allah is ready to strike you but you are engaged in a senseless, filthy game with impunity.

## Ayat 56

- `But this had only one answer from his people. They said:`
  - `"Expel Lot's folk from your city. They pretend to be absolutely clean."`

## Ayat 57

- `Eventually We saved (Lot) and his family, except his wife.`
- `We had decreed that she should be among those who would remain behind.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “The Prophet Lot (peace be upon him) had already been instructed not to take the woman along because she had to be destroyed along with her people.”

## Ayat 58

- `And We rained down upon them a rain.`
- `It was an evil rain for those who had already been warned.`
