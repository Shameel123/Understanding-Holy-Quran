**Ayat 83 - 88**

## Ayat 83

- `As for the Abode of the Hereafter,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Paradise which is the abode of real success.
- `We shall assign it exclusively for those who do not seek glory on earth`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Who do not seek exaltedness”: who are not desirous of establishing their own glory in God’s earth: who do not live like rebels and tyrants and arrogant people but like humble servants: who do not seek to make God’s servants their personal servants.
- `nor want to cause mischief.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Mischief” implies the chaos that inevitably appears in human life in consequence of violating the truth. Whatever man does when he disobeys Allah and turns away from His service is nothing but mischief. Partly this mischief occurs when wealth is amassed through unlawful means and expended in unlawful ways.
- `The God-fearing shall have the best end.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “The God fearing”: those who refrain from His disobedience.

## Ayat 84

- `He who shall bring a good deed shall be rewarded with what is better.`
- `But those who bring evil deeds shall not be requited more than their deeds.`

Subhan Allah. One of the best possible and hopeful Ayah I have come across recently for myself!

## Ayat 85

- `(O Prophet), surely He Who has ordained the Qur'an on you`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “He has placed on you the responsibility of conveying the Quran and teaching it to the people, and reforming the world according to the guidance contained in it.”
- `will bring you to the best end.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word maad in the original means the place to which one has to return ultimately.
    - Its use as a common noun implies that it is a place of eminence and glory.
    - Some commentators think it refers to Paradise.
      - But there is no reason why it should be restricted only to Paradise.
    - Let it remain indefinite as Allah Himself has put it so that the promise become applicable both in this world and to the next world. The context also requires that it should be looked upon as a promise to bestow the highest glory and eminence on the Prophet (peace be upon him) not only in the Hereafter, but in this world also.
    - In the saying of the disbelievers of Makkah, which has been the theme of the discourse from (verse 57) until now, they had said, “O Muhammad (peace be upon him), do you want us also to be doomed with you? If we join you and adopt this faith, it will become hard for us to live in Arabia.” In response to this, Allah tells His Prophet: “O Muhammad, that God Who has placed the burden of conveying the message of the Quran on you, will not destroy you: rather He will exalt you to the rank which these people cannot even imagine today.” And, in fact, in a few years after this, even in this world, Allah granted the Prophet (peace be upon him) complete authority over the whole of Arabia, and there was no power to resist him, and no religion to stand its ground. There had been no precedent in the history of Arabia that the whole peninsula might have come under the sway of one man so completely that no opponent might be there to challenge him and no soul to dare disobey his orders. Then it was not only a political domination but religious too, for the whole population had been won over to Islam.
- `Say to them:`
  - `"My Lord knows best who has brought true guidance and who is in clear error."`y

## Ayat 86

- `(O Prophet), you never looked forward for the Book to be revealed to you.`
- `It is out of sheer Mercy of your Lord that it was (revealed to you).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This thing is being presented as a proof of the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) prophethood. Just as the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) was unaware that he was going to be appointed a Prophet, and sent on a grand mission, when he had never even expected or wished for such a thing, but had been suddenly called upon while on a journey and made a Prophet and assigned a mission which had no relevance with his previous life. So was precisely the case with the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The people of Makkah knew well what kind of life he was leading till a day when he came down from the cave of Hira with the message of prophethood. They were fully aware of his occupations, of the topics of his conversation, of the nature of his interests and activities. No doubt it was a life which was an embodiment of truth, honesty and righteousness, a model of nobility, peacefulness, fulfillment of obligations and rights of others and of the service to humanity, but there was nothing in it which could give somebody any idea that the righteous man was going to make a claim to prophethood the next day. There was no one among his most intimate friends and relations and neighbors, who could say that he had already been preparing to become a Prophet. No one had ever heard a word on the themes and problems and topics from him, which became the subject of his daily conversation all of a sudden after the revolutionary moment in the cave of Hira. No one had heard him employing the kind of diction and words and terms, which the people started hearing from him in the shape of the Quran. He had never stood up for preaching, had never given a message or started a movement, and none of his activities had ever indicated that he was anxious to undertake a program for the solution of the social problems or for religious or moral reformation. Until the day before this revolutionary moment, he was leading the life of a trader, who earns his living by fair and lawful means. Who lives a happy life with his family, receives his guests, helps the poor and treats his relatives well, and at times retires from society into seclusion for the sake of worship. For such a person it would be a great change if he started making, all of a sudden, world moving orations, preaching a revolutionary message, producing a sublime literature and propounding an enduring philosophy of life and a profound system of thought and morality and social life. For psychologically too, such a change is not possible through any kind of preparation and conscious effort. Any such effort and preparation, in any case, has to pass through certain evolutionary stages, which cannot remain hidden from the people among whom a person is passing his life. Had the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) life passed through any such stages of gradual development, hundreds of the people in Makkah would have come out to say, “Did we not tell you beforehand that this man would one day make a tall claim?” But history bears evidence that no one in Makkah ever made such an objection although the disbelievers of Makkah raised all sorts of other objections against the Prophet (peace be upon him).
- `So do not lend any support to the unbelievers.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Then another thing: the Prophet (peace be upon him) never wished for or expected or awaited his appointment to prophethood, but he came across this experience all of a sudden quite unexpectedly. This is supported by the event that has been reported in the traditions in connection with the beginning of revelation. After his first meeting with the Angel Gabriel and the revelation of the initial verses of Surah Al-Alaq he rushes back home from Hira trembling with fear, and says to his wife, “Cover me with a cloak! Cover me with a cloak!” After a while when he recovers a little from the state of anxiety, he relates what he had experienced to his wife and says, **“I feel there is danger to my life!”** She responds, **“No, never! Allah will never bring you to grief: you render the rights of your kindred, you support the indigent, help the poor, treat your guests well, and are ever ready to contribute to a good cause.”** Then she takes him to Waraqa bin Naufal, who was her cousin and a righteous and knowledgeable person from among the people of the Book. Hearing from him what had happened, Waraqa says without any hesitation, **“The one who came to you is the same Namus (the specially appointed divine messenger), who used to come to Moses (peace be upon him). I wish I were a young man and could live till the time when your people will expel you.”** The Prophet (peace be upon him) asks, **“Will my people expel me?”** He replies, **“Yes; no one has passed before, who brought same thing that you have brought, and his people did not turn hostile to him.”**

## Ayat 87

- `And let it never happen that the unbelievers might turn you away from the revelations of Allah after they have been revealed to you.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Divert you: divert you from conveying them to others and acting in accordance with them in practical life.
- `Call people to your Lord and never become one of the unbelievers,`

## Ayat 88

- `and do not invoke any god beside Allah.`
- `There is no god but He.`
- `All will perish but He.`
- `To Him belongs the command.`
- `And to Him shall all of you return.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Another meaning can be: “Sovereignty is for Him, for He alone is entitled to it by right.”
