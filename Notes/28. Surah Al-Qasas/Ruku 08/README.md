**Ayat 76 - 82**

## Ayat 76

- `To be sure,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This fact also is being related in continuation of the answer to the excuse which has been the theme of the discourse from (verse 57) onward. In this regard, one should bear in mind the fact that the people who feared that the Prophet Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) message would affect the overall national interests adversely were, in fact, the big money owners, money lenders, and capitalists of Makkah, who by virtue of their international trade and money lending business had become the Korahs of their time. **These were the people who thought that the real truth was to earn and amass maximum wealth.** Anything that seemed to vitiate this object was an untruth which could not be accepted in any case.
    - On the other hand, there were the common people who looked with longing eyes at these magnates and earnestly desired that they should also attain the same heights as those people had attained. In an atmosphere charged with the love of money, as it was, people considered it to be a weighty argument that if the invitation of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) towards Tauhid and the Hereafter and the moral code was accepted, it would spell ruin for the Quraish not only commercially but economically too.
- `Qarun (Korah) was one of Moses' people;`
- `then he transgressed against them.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Qarun who has been called Korah in the Bible and the Talmud was a first cousin of the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him).
    - According to the account of descent given in Exodus, the fathers of the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) and Korah were real brothers.
    - At another place in the Quran it has been stated that this man had joined with Pharaoh in spite of being an Israelite and become one of his favorites; so much so that one of the two ring leaders of opposition to Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) after Pharaoh was this same Korah: **“We sent Moses to Pharaoh and Haman and Korah with Our signs and a clear authority of appointment, but they said: He is a sorcerer, a liar.”**(Surah Al-Mumin: Ayats 23-24).
- `We had bestowed on him such treasure that their very keys would have been raised with difficulty by a whole group of strong people.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - From this it follows that Korah had rebelled against his own people and become a supporter of the hostile forces which were bent upon wiping out the Israelites. On account of this rebellion against his own people he had attained a high place with Pharaoh. The two persons, besides Pharaoh, to whom the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) had been sent were Pharaoh’s minister Haman, and this Israelite capitalist, Korah. All other chiefs and couriers were of inferior status, who were not worth mentioning. The same position of Korah has been alluded to in (Surah Al-Ankabut: Ayat 39).
- `Once when his people said to him:`
  - `"Do not exult, for Allah does not love those who exult (in their riches).`

## Ayat 77

- `Seek by means of the wealth that Allah has granted you the Abode of the Hereafter,`
- `but forget not your share in this world`
- `and do good as Allah has been good to you`
- `and do not strive to create mischief in the land,`
  - `for Allah loves not those who create mischief."`

## Ayat 78

- `He replied:`
  - `"All this has been given to me on account of a certain knowledge that I have."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The words of the text can have two meanings:
        - (1) “Whatever I have obtained is by virtue of my own ability. It is not a bounty which somebody else might have given me as a favor without my deserving it as a right, and now I may have to render thanks for it by giving a portion of it to those who have not been given anything, as a favor, or give some of it in charity so that the bounty is not withdrawn from me.”
        - (2) “I think God has given me this wealth in view of my qualities and excellences. Had I not been a likable person, He would not have given me all this. That He has bestowed on me all kinds of blessings is a proof that I am His favorite and he approves of the way of life that I am following.”
- `Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him those who were stronger in might than he and were more numerous in multitude?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “Did this person who was proud of being so knowledgeable and wise and well informed and capable never know that people with greater wealth and grandeur and power and might than him had lived before him in the world, and Allah at last, had annihilated them completely? If capability and skill and competence are the only factors conducive to worldly progress, then why didn’t these virtues avail them when they were destroyed? And if the worldly progress of a person is a sure proof that Allah is pleased with him and approves of his deeds and qualities, then why were those people doomed to destruction at all?”
- `The wicked are not asked about their acts of sin.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “The criminals have always been claiming to be the best people, who are free from every evil, but their punishment is not dependent on their own confessions. Whenever they are seized; they are not seized on the basis of their own confessions of sins, etc.”

## Ayat 79

- `Once Korah went forth among his people in full glitter.`
- `Those seeking the life of this world said:`
  - **`"Would that we had the like of what Korah has! He truly has a great fortune."`**

## Ayat 80

- `But those endowed with true knowledge said:`
  - `"Woe to you. The reward of Allah is best for those who believe and act righteously.`
  - `But none except those who are patient shall attain to this."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “This kind of character and the way of thinking and the bounty of Allah’s reward falls to the lot of only those who stick firmly and steadfastly and patiently to the lawful ways in life, whether by so doing they are able to earn only a bare living, or are enabled to become millionaires, but are never inclined to follow the unlawful ways even if they are promised all the benefits and wealth of the world. 
  - In this verse,
    - “Allah’s reward” means the bounteous provision that is gained by man in the world and the Hereafter as a result of labor and toil undertaken within the bounds set by Allah; and 
    - “patience” means to have control over one’s emotions and desires, to stick to honesty and righteousness as against greed and lust, to bear the losses that one may have to incur on account of the truth and justice, to spurn the gains that might accrue from employing unlawful devices, to remain content and satisfied with the lawful earning even if it is meager and insufficient, to eschew feelings of envy and jealousy at the splendor of the corrupt people and avoid, even casting a glance at it, and to be satisfied with the thought that for an honest man the colorless purity that Allah has granted him by His grace is better than the lustrous filth of evil and corruption.
    - As for “fortune”, it implies Allah’s reward as well as the pure mentality by virtue of which a believing and righteous person finds it easier to suffer hunger and starvation than become a multi millionaire by adopting dishonest and corrupt ways and means.”

## Ayat 81

- `At last We caused the earth to swallow him and his house.`
- `Thereafter there was no group of people that could come to his aid against Allah;`
- `nor was he able to come to his own aid.`

## Ayat 82

- `And those who had envied his position the day before began to say on the morrow:`
  - `"Alas, we had forgotten that it is Allah Who increases the provision of those of His servants whom He will and grants in sparing measure to those whom He will.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is “The extension or the restriction of provisions is always according to the will of Allah, and Allah’s will is determined by His own reasons and considerations. His favoring somebody with generous provisions does not necessarily mean that Allah is well pleased with him and is honoring him with gifts. Mostly it so happens that a person is under Allah’s wrath, but He goes on favoring him with more and more wealth till, at last, the same wealth causes Allah’s torment to descend on him. Contrary to this, if somebody is being given restricted provisions, it does not necessarily mean that Allah is displeased with him and is punishing him. Mostly the righteous live in hardship although they are Allah’s favorites, and in many cases the same hardship becomes a cause of Allah’s mercy for them. Consequently, a person who does not understand this reality looks with envious eyes at the prosperity of those who actually deserve Allah’s wrath.”
  - `But for Allah's favour upon us, He could have made us to be swallowed too.`
  - `Alas, we had forgotten that the unbelievers do not prosper."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, “We had the misconception, that worldly prosperity and wealth by themselves constituted real success. Therefore, we thought that Korah was highly successful, but now we have come to know that real success is an entirely different thing, and it is never attained by the disbelievers.”
