**Ayat 29 - 42**

## Ayat 29

- `When Moses had fulfilled the term`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - According to Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with them), the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) had completed the ten years term instead of the eight years. According to Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), this has been related on the authority of the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself. He has said, “Moses (peace be upon him) completed the term which was more perfect and more agreeable to his father in law, i.e. ten years.”
- `and was journeying with his family, he perceived a fire in the direction of the Mount (Sinai).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That the direction of the journey was towards Mt. Toor shows that the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) might be traveling to Egypt with his family, for Toor lies on the way from Midian to Egypt. Probably Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) thought that he had stayed away from home for ten long years and the Pharaoh in whose reign he had left Egypt had also died, if he quietly went back and stayed with his people, nobody would know it.
- `He said to his family:`
  - `"Wait here; I have observed a fire. Maybe I will bring to you some news or a brand of fire from there that you may warm yourselves."`

## Ayat 30

- `But when he came to the fire, a cry was heard from the right bank1 of the valley,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, on that side of the valley which lay to the right of the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him).
- `from a tree in the hallowed ground:`
  - **`"O Moses, verily I am Allah, the Lord of all creatures of the Universe."`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - These two miracles were shown to the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) at that time so that, firstly, he himself is fully convinced that the same Being Who is speaking to him is, in fact, the Creator and Master and Ruler of the whole system of the universe and secondly, he should have full satisfaction that he was not going unarmed before Pharaoh, to perform the dangerous mission assigned to him, but would go well armed with the two powerful weapons.

## Ayat 31

- `He received the command:`
  - `"Throw away your rod!"`
- `But when he saw the rod writhing as though it were a serpent, he turned back in retreat, and did not even look behind.`
- `(He was told):`
  - `"O Moses, go ahead and have no fear. You are perfectly secure.`

## Ayat 32

- `Put your hand into your bosom, and it will come out shining without any blemish;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - These two miracles were shown to the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) at that time so that, firstly, he himself is fully convinced that the same Being Who is speaking to him is, in fact, the Creator and Master and Ruler of the whole system of the universe and secondly, he should have full satisfaction that he was not going unarmed before Pharaoh, to perform the dangerous mission assigned to him, but would go well armed with the two powerful weapons.
- `and draw your hand close to your body to still your fear.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “Whenever you experience the fear of any danger, fold back your arm to yourself: this will strengthen your heart and will deliver you completely from every feeling of fear and dread.”
- `Those are the two clear Signs from your Lord for Pharaoh and his chiefs, for truly they are a disobedient people."`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The arm probably implies the right arm. The arm can be folded back in two ways: either by bringing the arm and pressing it against the side, or by pressing one hand under the armpit of the other. Probably the first way was implied, for in that case the other person cannot perceive that one is specially doing so in order to ward off fear.

## Ayat 33

- `Moses said:`
  - `"My Lord, I have killed one person from among them, and I fear that they will kill me.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It did not mean that he was hesitant to go there because of the fear, but it meant this: “Kindly make some such arrangement that I am not apprehended on the charge of murder just on arrival even before I may convey to them Your message, for in that case the very object for which I am being sent will be defeated.” The next verse makes it plain that the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him), by this submission, did not at all mean to reject the office of prophethood and refuse to go before Pharaoh because of the fear.

## Ayat 34

- `My brother Aaron is more eloquent in speech than I:`
- `so send him with me as a helper to confirm my truthfulness for I fear that they will reject me as a liar."`

## Ayat 35

- `He said:`
  - `"We will certainly strengthen you through your brother and will invest both of you with such power that they shall not be able to hurt you.`
  - `With the help of Our Signs the two of you and your followers will prevail."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This meeting of the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) with Allah and the mutual conversation has been described in much greater detail in(Surah Ta-Ha Ayats 9- 48).
  - Anyone who compares this Quranic version with the story given in the Bible will himself be able to judge which of the two is a divine revelation and which one is the result of human story telling.
  - Besides, he will also be able to judge whether the Quranic version is, God forbid, a plagiarism of the Bible and Israelite traditions, or that God Himself is describing the actual event, Who had honored Moses (peace be upon him) by calling him up into His Presence. See (E.N. 19 of Surah Ta-Ha).

## Ayat 36

- `But when Moses came to them with Our Clear Signs, they said:`
  - `"This is nothing but a magic that has been contrived.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The words of the text mean “Fabricated or forged magic.” If fabrication is taken to mean falsehood, it would mean, “The staff's turning into a serpent and the shining of the hand is not any real change in the nature of the thing itself, but a mere illusion, which this man calls a miracle in order to deceive us.” And if it is taken to mean a forgery, it will imply: “This person has forged something which appears to be a staff; but when it is thrown on the ground, it moves like a snake. As for the hand, he has rubbed something on it so that when he draws it out of the armpit, it shines. He himself works these magical tricks but tries to make us believe that these are miracles which God has granted him.”
  - `We never heard anything like it from our ancestors of yore."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The reference is to the teachings which the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) had presented while conveying this message of Tauhid. The details have been given at other places in the Quran. For example, according to(Surah An-Naziyat: Ayats 18-19), he said to Pharaoh: “Will you mind to purify yourself, that I may guide you to your Lord so that you may have fear (of Him)?” And in (Surah Ta Ha: Ayats 47-48), “We have come to you with signs from your Lord; peace is for him who follows the right way. We have been informed by revelation that there is punishment for him who rejects it and turns away.” And: “We are Messengers from your Lord: so let the Israelites go with us.” It was about these things that Pharaoh said, “Even our forefathers had never heard that there was a Being more powerful than Pharaoh of Egypt, Who was authorized to command him, to punish him, to send a man to his court to convey His instructions to him, and to warn the king of Egypt to fear Him. These are strange things which we are hearing today from a man like you.”


## Ayat 37

- `Moses replied:`
  - `"My Lord knows best who comes with guidance from Him, and also whose end will be the best in the Hereafter.`
  - `As for the wrongdoers, they shall not prosper."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “You think I am a magician and a forger, but my Lord is well aware of me. He knows what sort of a man is the person whom He has appointed as a messenger; and the final judgment rests with Him. If I am a liar, I shall meet an evil end; and if you are a liar, you should know that your end will not be good. In any case, the inevitable fact is that the unjust will not attain true success. He, who is not Allah’s messenger but falsely presents himself as a messenger for selfish motives, is also unjust and will not attain success. And the one who rejects a true messenger by false accusations and suppresses the truth by deceit and fraud, is also unjust and will never attain success.”

## Ayat 38

- `Pharaoh said:`
  - `"O nobles, I do not know that you have any god beside myself.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - By this Pharaoh did not, and could not, mean that he was the creator of his people and the earth and the heavens, for such a thing be uttered only by a madman. Likewise; he also did not mean that they had no other deity besides him for the Egyptians worshiped many gods, and the Pharaoh himself had been made the incarnation of the sun god. The Quran testifies that the Pharaoh himself worshiped many gods: **“The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said, Will you leave Moses and his followers free to spread disorder in the land, and to discard you and your deities?”** (Surah Al-Aaraf: Ayat 127) Therefore, inevitably, the Pharaoh had not used the word “god” here for himself as a creator and deity, but as an absolute and supreme sovereign. What he meant was this: “I am the owner of this land of Egypt: I alone will rule here: My law will be the law of the land; I alone shall be accepted as the fountainhead of all commands and prohibitions here. None else is entitled to give commands in this country. Who is this Moses, who has appeared as the delegate of the Lord of the universe and is conveying orders to me as though he is the ruler and I am his subordinate?” That is why he addressed his courtiers, thus: **“O people: Is not the kingdom of Egypt mine? And are not these canals flowing beneath me?”** (Surah Az-Zukhruf: Ayat 51). And that is why he said to Moses (peace be upon him) again and again, **“Have you come to turn us away from the faith of our forefathers so that you too may dominate over the land?”** (Surah Yunus: Ayat 78). **“O Moses, have you come to drive us out of our land by the power of your sorcery?”** (Surah Ta-Ha: Ayat 57) **“I fear he will change your religion, or cause mischief to appear in the land.”** (Surah Al-Mumin: Ayat 26).
  - `Haman, bake bricks out of clay and build a lofty palace for me so that I may mount up and be able to observe the god of Moses, even though I believe that Moses is a liar."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - If the matter is considered from this angle it will become evident that the position of Pharaoh was no different from the position of those states which claim political and legal sovereignty independent of divine law brought by the prophets. Whether they accept a king as the fountainhead of law and commands and prohibitions, or the will of the nation, in any case as long as they stick to the position that the country will be ruled by their law and not by the Law of Allah and His Messengers, there will be no fundamental difference between their position and that of Pharaoh. It is, however, a different thing that the ignorant people curse Pharaoh but approve these as lawful. A person who understands reality will look for the spirit and sense and not merely for words and terminology. Pharaoh had used the word “god” for himself but these states use the term sovereignty in the same sense. See(E.N. 21 Surah Ta-Ha).

## Ayat 39

- `And he and his hosts waxed arrogant in the land without any right,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Allah, Lord of the worlds, alone is entitled to the right to greatness, but Pharaoh and his hosts assumed greatness when they attained a little power in a small territory on the earth.
- `believing that they will never have to return to Us!`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “They thought they were answerable to none and with this assumption they started behaving absolutely independently in their day to day life.”

## Ayat 40

- `Eventually We seized him and his hosts and We flung them into the sea.`
- `So do see the end of the wrong-doers!`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Allah in these words has depicted their worthlessness and insignificance as against their false pride. They thought they were big people, but when the respite, Allah had granted them to reform, came to an end, they were thrown into the sea like rubbish.

## Ayat 41

- `And We made them leaders who invite people to the Fire.`
- `On the Day of Judgement they shall not find help from any quarter.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “They have set a precedent for the later generations as to committing injustices, rejecting the truth and persistence in their rejection till the last, and using all sorts of devices to defend falsehood against the truth.” They showed these ways to the people and have gone to Hell, and now their descendants are following in their footsteps and rushing towards the same doom.

## Ayat 42

- `We have made a curse to pursue them in this world,`
- `and on the Day of Judgement they shall be among the despised.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The words in the text mean: “On the Day of Resurrection they will be among the maqbuhin”, which has several meanings:
    - (l) They will stand rejected and repulsed; 
    - (2) they will be wholly deprived of Allah’s mercy; and 
    - (3) they will be severely beaten up and their faces will become distorted.
