**Ayat 61 - 75**

## Ayat 61

- `Now, he to whom We have promised a good which he is going to obtain � can he be like him whom We have given the good things of this life, but who will be brought up for punishment on the Day of Judgement?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the fourth answer to their excuse. To understand it fully one should bear in mind two things: 
    - First, the present life which is no more than a few years for anyone is only the temporary phase of a journey. The real life which will be everlasting is yet to come. In this life man may amass as much provision as he may please and live the few years at his disposal as comfortably as he can, it will in any case come to an end, and man will depart from the world empty handed. No sensible person will like to make the bad bargain of suffering the everlasting distress and affliction in the Hereafter in exchange for the pleasures and comforts of his brief sojourn in the world. As against this, he would rather prefer to face a few years of hardships here and earn the goodness that may earn him everlasting bliss and comfort in the eternal life of the next world.

## Ayat 62

- `(Let them not forget) that the Day when Allah will call unto them, and say:`
  - `"Where are those whom you imagined to be My associates?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This discourse is in continuation of the fourth answer, and is linked with the last sentence of the preceding verse. It means to imply this: Those who persist in the evil of shirk and idol worship and refuse to believe in the Prophet only for the sake of their worldly interests, will meet with such and such evil consequences in the eternal life of the Hereafter. They should, therefore, carefully judge for themselves whether it would be a good bargain if they were to be doomed to such an end, after they had enjoyed fully the provisions and adornments of the *short worldly life*, even if no calamity befell them in the world.

## Ayat 63

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This implies those satans from among jinns and men, who had been set up as associates of God in the world, whose teachings had been followed in preference to divine commandments, and dependence on whom had made the people give up the right way and adopt the wrong ways of life. Such persons may not have been called gods and lords as such, but since they were worshiped and obeyed as one should worship and obey only God, they were inevitably made partners in Godhead.

- `Those against whom the Word will be realised will say:`
  - `"Our Lord, these are the ones whom we led astray just as we ourselves strayed.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, “We did not lead them astray forcibly. We neither deprived them of their powers of seeing and hearing nor of their powers of thinking, nor there ever arose a situation when they wanted to follow the right way but we might have forcibly pulled them to the wrong way. But just as we ourselves had gone astray of our own free will, so they also of their own free will accepted the wrong way when we presented it before them. Therefore, we are not responsible for what they did: we are responsible for our acts and they are responsible for theirs.”
  - `We absolve ourselves before You of all blame.`
  - `It was not us that they worshipped."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - There is a subtle point to be noted here. Allah, in fact, will question those who had set up others as associates with Him, but before they make an answer, those who had been set up as associates will speak up. The reason is: When the common polytheists will be questioned thus, their leaders and guides will feel that their doomsday had come, for their followers will certainly blame them for their deviation. Therefore, even before the followers say something in response, the leaders will forestall them and start pleading their innocence.

## Ayat 64

- `They will then be told:`
  - `"Call upon those for help whom you declared to be Our associates."`
- `They will then call upon them but they will not answer them.`
- `They will have observed the chastisement in front of them.`
- `Would that they were guided!`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “Invoke them for help. In the world you had relied on them and rejected Our commandments. So invoke them to come to your rescue here also and save you from the punishment.”

## Ayat 65

- `(Let them not disregard) that the Day when Allah will call out to them saying:`
  - `"What was the answer you gave to the Messengers?"`

## Ayat 66

- `Then they will not be able to think of any reply, nor will they be able to ask one another.`

## Ayat 67

- `But those who repented and believed and acted righteously, they will perhaps be among those who will prosper there.`

## Ayat 68

- `Your Lord`
  - `creates what He will and`
  - `chooses (for His tasks) whomsoever He will.`
- **`It is not for them to make the choice.`**
- **`Glory be to Allah.`**
- **`He is exalted far above their associating others in His Divinity.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This, in fact, is a refutation of shirk. Allah objects to the setting up of countless gods from among His creatures by the mushriks and assigning to them from themselves of attributes and ranks and offices, and says: “We Ourselves bless with whatever attributes, capabilities and powers whomever We like from among the men, angels, jinns and other servants whom We have created, and employ whomever We will for whatever service We will. But, how and where from have the mushriks gotten the authority that they should make whomever they like from among My servants remover of hardships, bestower of treasures and answerer of prayers? That they should make someone the lord of rain, another the giver of jobs and children, still another bestower of health and ill-health? That they should look upon whomever they please as the ruler of a part of My Kingdom and assign to him whichever of My powers they like? Whether it is an angel or a jinn, or a prophet, or saint, or anybody else, he has been created by Us. Whatever excellences he has, have been granted by Us, and whatever service We willed to take from him, We have taken. Therefore, the selection of someone for a particular service does not mean that he should be raised from the position of a servant to godhead and be worshipped instead of God, invoked for help, prayed to for fulfillment of needs, taken as maker or destroyer of destinies and possessor of divine attributes and powers.

## Ayat 69

- **`Your Lord knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The object for which this thing has been said in this context is: A person can make a claim before the people in this world that he is fully satisfied on rational grounds that the deviation he has adopted is sound and right. And the arguments that are given against it are not convincing; that he has adopted the deviation not due to any evil motive but with the sincerest and purest intentions; that he has never been confronted by anything that might have proved him to be in the wrong. But he cannot advance such an argument before Allah, for Allah is not only aware of the open, but also of the hidden secrets of the mind and heart. He knows directly what kind of knowledge and feelings and sentiments and desires and intentions and conscience a certain person has. He is aware of the occasions and the means and the ways through which a person was warned, through which the truth reached him, through which falsehood was proved to be false to him, and also the real motives for which he preferred his deviation to the right way.

## Ayat 70

- `He is Allah;`
- `there is no god but He.`
- `His is the praise in this world and in the Hereafter.`
- `His is the command and to Him will all of you be returned.`

## Ayat 71

- `(O Prophet), tell them:`
  - `"Did you consider: if Allah were to make the night perpetual over you till the Day of Judgement, is there a god other than Allah who can bring forth light for you? Do you not hear?"`

## Ayat 72

- `Say:`
  - `"Did you consider: if Allah were to make the day become perpetual over you till the Day of Judgement, is there a god other than Allah who can bring in night for you that you may repose in it? Will you not see?"`

## Ayat 73

- `It is out of His Mercy that He has made for you night and day that you may repose (during the night) and seek His Bounty (during the day) that you might be grateful.`

## Ayat 74

- `(Let them bear in mind) that on that Day when He will call out to them saying:`
  - `"Where are My associates, those whom you imagined to be so?"`

## Ayat 75

- `And from each people We shall draw a witness,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “A witness”: the prophet who had warned that community, or a rightly guided person from among the followers of the prophets, who had performed the duty of preaching the truth in the community, or a means through which the message of the truth had reached the community.
- `and shall say to them:`
  - `"Do produce your evidence now."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, “Present a cogent argument in your defense so that you are pardoned. You should either prove that the shirk and the denial of the Hereafter and prophethood in which you persisted were the correct creed. And you had adopted it on rational grounds. Or, if you cannot do that, you should at least prove that no arrangement had been made by God to warn you of this error and guide you to the right path.”
- `Then they shall know that the Truth is with Allah alone, and the lies which they had invented will forsake them.`
