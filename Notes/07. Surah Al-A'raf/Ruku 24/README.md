**Ayat 189 - 206**

## Ayat 189

- `It is He - Allah -Who created you from a single being,`
- `and out of it He made its mate,`
- `that he may find comfort in her.`
- `And when he covers her, she bears a light burden and goes about with it.`
- `Then, when she grows heavy, they pray to their Lord:`
  - **`'If You bestow upon us a healthy child, we will surely give thanks.'`**

## Ayat 190

- `But when He vouchsafes them a healthy child, they attribute to Him partners regarding what Allah had bestowed upon them.`
- `Subliminally exalted is Allah above that which they associate with Him.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The present and succeeding (verses 190-8) seek to refute polytheism. These verses are devoted to highlighting the implications of the postulate which even the polytheists affirmed - that it is God Who originally created the human species. They also acknowledge that every human being owes his existence to God. God also holds absolute power over the entire process leading to man's birth, right from the fertilization of the ovurn in the uterus to its onward development in the form of a living being, then investing it with numerous faculties and ensuring its birth as a sound, healthy baby.
  - No one has the power to prevent God, if He so willed, from causing a wornan to give birth to an animal or to odd creature, or to a physically or mentally handicapped baby. This fact is also equally acknowledged by monotheists and polytheists.
    - It is for this reason that in the final stage of pregnancy, people are inclined to turn to God and pray for the birth of a sound and healthy baby.
  - It is, however, the very, height of man's ignorance and folly that after a sound and healthy baby has been born as a result of God's will, man makes offerings at the altars of false gods, goddesses, or saints. Occasionally the names given to the child (e.g., 'abd al-Rasul, 'abd al-'Uzza, 'abd Shams, etc.) also indicate that **man feels grateful to others than God and regardsthe child as a gift either of sorne Prophet, some noted Companion of the Prophet (peace be on him), or some other noted personality such as his spiritual mentor rather than a gift from God.**
  - There has been some misunderstanding with regard to the point emphasized here. This misunderstanding has been further reinforced by traditions of doubtful authenticity. The Qur'an mentions that human being's are created from a single person, and obviously here that person means Adam (peace be on him). Now this reference to one person is soon followed by reference to his spouse, and that both prayed to God for the birth of a sound and healthy baby. And when that prayer was accepted, the couple are mentioned as having associated others with God in the granting of His favour. The misunderstanding consists in considering this couple, who fell prey to polytheism, to be Adam and Eve. People resorted to unauthentic traditions to explain the above verse and the story which thus gained acceptance was the following.
  - *It was claimed that Eve suffered several mishaps since her offspring would die after birth. Satan seized this opportunity to mislead her into naming her baby Abd al-Harith (the slave of Satan). (See the comments of Ibn Kathir on verse 190. Cf. Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 5, p. 11 - Ed.) What is most shocking is that some of these unsubstantiated traditions have been ascribed to the Prophet (peace be on him).* 
  - **The fact, however, is that the above account does not have even an iota of truth.** Nor is it, in any way, corroborated by the Qur'an itself.
  - The only point brought home by the Qur'an is that it is God alone, to the total exclusion of every one else, Who brought the first human couple into being. And again it is God alone Who causes the birth of each baby born out of the intercourse between a man and a woman.
  - The Qur'an also points out that the of this truth is innate in human nature which is evident from the fact that in states of distress and crisis man turns prayerfully to God alone. Ironically, however, after God blesses those prayers with acceptance, a number of people associate others with God in His divinity.
  - The fact is that the present verses do not refer to any particular man and woman. The allusion is in fact to every man and woman enmeshed in polytheism.
  - Here another point deserves attention. These verses condemn the Arabian polytheists on account of the fact that when God granted them sound children in response to their prayers they associated others with God in offering thanks.
  - But what is the situation of many Muslims of today who strongly believe in the unity of God? Their situation seems even worse. It is not uncommon for them to ask others than God to grant children. **They, make vows during pregnancy to others than God, and make offerings to others than God after child-birth.**
  - Yet they are satisfied that they have a full guarantee of Paradise since they are believers in the One True God whereas the Arabian polytheists would inevitably be consigned to Hell.
  - It is only the doctrinal errors of the pre-Islamic Arabian polytheists which may be condemned. The doctrinal errors of Muslims are beyond all criticism and censure.

## Ayat 191

- `Do they associate (with Allah in His divinity) those who can create nothing;`
- `rather, they are themselves created?`

## Ayat 192

- **`They have no power to help others. nor can they help themselves.`**

## Ayat 193

- `And if you call them to true guidance, they will not follow you.`
- `It is all the same for you whether you call them to true guidance or keep silent.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - As to the false gods set up by the polytheists, what is the extent of their power? 
  - Not only, do they not have the power to guide others, they do not even have the power to follow others or even to answer the call of their devotees. 

## Ayat 194

- `Those whom you invoke other than Allah are creatures like you.`
- `So invoke them. and see if they answer your call, if what you claim is true.`

## Ayat 195

- `Have they feet on which they can walk?`
- `Have they hands with which they can grasp?`
- `Have they eyes with which they can see?`
- `Have they ears with which they can hear?`
- `Say [O Muhammad]:`
  - `'Invoke all those to whom you ascribe a share in Allah's divinity, then scheme against me and grant me no respite.`

## Ayat 196

- `My guardian is Allah Who has revealed the Book,`
- `and it is He Who protects the righteous.`

## Ayat 197

- `And those whom you invoke other than Allah,`
- `they can neither help themselves nor you.`

## Ayat 198

- `And if you were to call them to true guidance,`
- `they will not hear;`
- `and you observe them looking at you whereas they have no power to see.'`

## Ayat 199

- `[O Prophet!]`
- `Show forgiveness,`
- `enjoin equity,`
- `and avoid the ignorant.`

## Ayat 200

- `And if it happens that a prompting from Satan should stir you up,`
- `seek refuge with Allah.`
- `He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.`

## Ayat 201

- `If the God-fearing are instigated by any suggestion of Satan,`
- `they instantly become alert,`
- `whereafter they clearly perceive the right way.`

## Ayat 202

- `As for their brethren [the Satans],`
- `they draw them deeper into error`
- `and do not relax in their efforts.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here some important directives are addressed to the Prophet (peace be on him) regarding how he should preach the Message of Islam and how he should guide and reform people.
  - The object of these directives is not merely to instruct the Prophet (peace be on him), but also to instruct all those who would shoulder the same responsibility after the Prophet (peace be on him) was no longer amidst them. The major directives are as follows:
    1. The most important qualities that must be cultivated by anyone who calls others to the truth are tenderness, magnanimity, and forbearing. Such a person should also have the capacity to tolerate the lapses of his companions and to patiently endure the excesses of his opponents. He should also be able to keep his cool in the face of grave provocation and gracefully connive at the offensive behaviour of others. In facing the angry words, slander, persecution and mischief of his opponents, he should exercise the utmost self-restraint. Harshness, severity, bitterness. and vindictive provocativeness on his part are bound to undermine his mission.
      -  The same point seems to have been made in a Hadith in which the Prophet (peace be on him) says that he has been commanded by his Lord: **'...to say the just word whether I am angry, or pleased; to maintain ties with nim who severs ties with me; and to give to him who denies me (my right); and to forgive him who wrongs me.'** (See the comments of Qurtubi in his Tafsir on the verse - Ed.)
      -  The Prophet (peace be on him) also instructed all those whom he deputized for preaching: **'Give good news rather than arouse revulsion: make things easy rather than hard.'** (Muslim, Kitab al-Ilm, Bab fi al-amr bi al-Taysir wa Tark al-Ta'sir'- Ed.)
      -  This distinguishing feature of the Prophet's personality has also been mentioned in the Qur'an. It was thanks to Allah's mercy that you were gentle to them. Had you been rough, hard-hearted, they would surely have scattered away, from you (AI 'Imran 3:159).
   2. The second key to the success in da'wah work is to stay away from excessive theorizing and intellectual hair-splitting. One should rather call people in clear and simple terms to those virtues which are recognized as such by the generality of mankind and appeal to common sense. The great advantage of this method is that the Message of Islam finds its way right to the hearts of people at all levels of understanding. Those who then seek to oppose the Message are soon exposed and end up antagonizing the common people. For when the common people obserse on the one hand decent and righteous people being opposed for the simple reason that they are inviting people to universally-known virtues, and on the other hand observe those opponents resorting to all kinds of immoral and inhuman means, they are bound to incline to support the standard bearers of truth and righteousness. This process goes on until a point where the only opponents left are those whose self-interest is inextricably linked with the prevailing unrighteous system, or those's who have been totally blinded by their bigoted adherence to ancestral tradition or by their irrational biases. The wisdom underlying the Prophet's method accounts for his phenomenal success and for the speedy spread of Islam in and around Arabia within a short span of time. People flocked to Islam in vast numbers so much so that in some lands eighty and ninety per cent of the population embraced Islam. In fact there are even instances of a hundred per cent of the population embracing Islam.
   3. The interest of the Islamic mission requires, on the one hand, that righteousness should be enjoined on those who have the propensity to become righteous. On the other hand, it also requires that those who are overly insistent in their adherence to falsehood, should be left alone, and that their acts of provocation be ignored. Those who seek to spread Islam should confine their efforts to persuading only those who are prepared to consider the Message of Islam in reasonable manner. When someone becomes altogether unreasonable and quarrelsome, and resorts to indecent methods of taunting and reviling Islam, Muslims should simply refuse to become adversative. For all the time and effort devoted to reforming such people will be totally wasted.
   4. The moment the proponent of the Islamic Message feels that he is being provoked by the excesses, mischief, and uncalled-for objections and accusation, he should realize that he is being influenced by Satan. In such a situation he should immediately seek refuge with God, and restrain himself lest his impulsiveness damage his cause. **The cause of Islam can be served only by those who act cool-headedly.** Only those steps are appropriate which have been taken after due consideration rather than under the influence of impulse and emotion. Satan, however, is ever on the look-out for opportunities to sabotage the efforts made in the cause of Islam. He, therefore, ensures that those who are working for the Islamic cause are subjected to unjust and mischievous attacks from their opponents. The purpose underlying this is to provoke the workers for the cause of Islam to engage in the senseless and harmful task of mounting counter-attacks against their opponents. The appeal that Satan makes to those well-meaning, religious people is often couched in religious phraseology and is backed up by religious argument. But the fact is that **those counter-attacks are undertaken merely under the impulse of man's lower self**.
     - The last two verses, therefore, make it clear that those who are God-fearing are always very sensitive to provocations under the impulse of Satan, and as soon as they become aware of such a provocation, they promote the best interests of the cause of truth rather than satisfy their vengeful feelings. As for those who are driven by egotistical impulses, they succumb to the promptings of Satan and are eventually set on an erroneous path. They fall victim to Satan, act virtually as his puppet, and subsequently their degradation knows no limit. They pay their opponents back in the same coin, tit for tat.
     - What has been said above also has another import. It seeks to remind the God-fearing that their ways should be perceptibly different from the ways of those who do not fear God. The God-fearing not only avoid evil, but the very idea of committing it pricks their conscience and rankles their hearts. They have an instinctive revulsion against evil, a revulsion similar to what a cleanliness-loving man feels at the sight of a big stain or a splash of filth on his clothes. This feeling causes the God-fearing to remove every stain of evil. 
     - Quite contrary are those who have no fear of God, who have no desire to stay away from evil and who are in harmony with the ways of Satan. Such people are always given to evil thoughts and wrong-doing.  

## Ayat 203

- `[O Prophet!]`
- `When you do not produce before them any miracle, they say:`
  - `'Why do you not choose for yourself a miracle?'`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This question is a taunt rather than a simple query. What the utterance implies is that if the claim to prophethood is genuine, it should have been supported by some miracle. The next verse contains a fitting rejoinder to the taunt.
- `Say to them:`
  - `'I follow only what is revealed to me by my Lord.`
  - `This is nothing but a means of insight into the truth, and guidance and mercy from your Lord to the people who believe.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The Prophet (peace be on him) is being made to tell his opponents in clear terms that he has no power to get whatever he wants. Being God's Messenger, he is required to follow the directives of the One Who has sent him and has granted him the Qur'an which has the light of guidance.
      - The major characteristic of this Book is that those who seek guidance from it do indeed find the right way. The moral excellence visible in the lives of those people who accept the Qur'an is testimony to the fact that they have been blessed with God's mercy.

## Ayat 204

- `So when the Qur'an is recited,`
- `listen carefully to it,`
- `and keep silent so that you may, be shown mercy.'`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The unbelievers are asked to shed their prejudice and to abandon their deliberate indifference to the Qur'an.
  - Whenever the Qur'an is recited to them, they stuff their fingers into their ears and make a lot of noise lest they or any others hear the Qur'an.
  - They should better behave more maturely and make an effort to grasp the teachings of the Qur'an.
  - It is quite likely that their study, of the Book would ultimately make them share with Muslims the blessings of the Qur'an.
  - This is an excellent, subtle and heart-winning approach which simply cannot be over-praised.
  - Those who are interested in learning the art of effective preaching can benefit immensely by, pondering over this Qur'anic verse. The main purpose of the verse has also been explained. By implication, however, the verse also enjoins people to be silent and to listen attentively to the Qur'an when it is being recited.
  - **The verse also provides the basis of the rule that when the leader (imam) is reciting verses of the Qur'an in Prayer, the followers in the congregation should (refrain from reciting and) listen to the recitation in silence.**
  - There is some disagreement among scholars on this issue.
  - Abu Hanifah and his disciples are of the view that the followers in the congregation should remain silent, irrespective of whether the the imam is reciting the Qur'an aloud or silently in his mind.
  - On the other hand, Malik and Ahmad b. Hanbal are of the opinion that the followers in the congregation should listen silently only when the Qur'an is being recited aloud.
  - According to Shafi'i, the followers in the congrega tion should also recite the Qur'an regardless of whether the imam is reciting the Qur'an aloud or silently'. His view is based on the Hadith that Prayer without recitation of al-Fatihah is void. (See Ibn Rushd, Bidayat al-Mujtahid, vol. 1, pp. 149-50; Ibn Qudamah, al-Mughni, vol. 1, pp. 562-9 - Ed.)

## Ayat 205

- `And remember [O Prophet] your Lord in your mind, with humility and fear, and without raising your voice;`
- `remember Him in the morning and evening,`
- `and do not become of those who are negligent.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The command to remember the Lord signifies remembrance in Prayer as well as otherwise, be it verbally or in one's mind.
  - Again the directive to remember God in the morning and in the evening refers to Prayer at those times as well as remembering God at all times.
  - The purpose of so saying is to emphasis constant remembrance of God. This admonition - that man ought to remember God always - constitutes the conclusion of the discourse lest man becomes heedless of God. For every error and corruption stems from the fact that man tends to forget that God is his Lord and that in his own part he is merely, a servant of God who is being tested in the world; that he will be made to render, after his death, a full account to his Lord of all his deeds.
  - All those who care to follow, righteousness would, therefore, be ill-advised not to let these basic facts slip out of their minds. Hence Prayer, remembrance of God and keeping ones attention ever focused on God are frequently stressed in the Qur'an.


## Ayat 206

- `[The angels] who are near to Your Lord,`
- `never turn away from His service out of arrogance;`
- `they rather glorify Him`
- `and prostrate themselves before Him.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Whoever recites or hears this verse should fall in prostration so as to emulate the practice of angels.
  - In addition. prostration also proves that one has no shred of pride, nor is one averse to the duty of being subservient to God.
  - In all, there are fourteen verses in the Qur'an the recitation of which requires one to prostrate. That one should prostrate on reading or hearing these verses is, in principle, an incontrovertible point.
  - There is, however, some disagreement about it being obligatory (wajib).
  - Abu Hanifah regards it as obligatory, while other authorities consider it to be recommended (Ibn Qudamah, Al-Mughni, vol. 1. p. 663; Al-Jaziri, Kitab al-Fiqh 'ala al Madhahib al-arba'ah, vol. 1. p. 464 - Ed.)
  - According to traditions, while reciting the Qur'an in large gatherings, when the Prophet (peace be on him) came upon a verse the recitation of which calls for prostration, he prostrated, and the whole gathering followed suit. The traditions mention that sometimes some people did not have room to prostrate. Such people prostrated on the backs of others. (See Bukhari, Abwab sujud al-Quran 'Bab Izdiham al-Nas Idh'a qara'a al-Imam al-Sajdah'- Ed.)
  - It is reported in connection with the conquest of Makka that in the course of the Qur'an-recitation, as the Prophet (peace be on him) read such a verse, those standing fell into prostration while those who were mounted on horses and camels performed prostration in that very state.
  - It is also on record that while delivering a sermon from the pulpit the Prophet (peace be on him) came down from the pulpit to offer prostration, and resumed his sermon thereafter. (Abu da'ud, Kitab al-Salah, 'Bab al-Sujud fi Sad' - Ed.)
  - It is generally, believed that the conditions for this kind of prostration are exactly the same as required for offering Prayer - that one should be in a state of ritual purity, that one should be facing the Ka'bah, and that the prostration should be performed as in the state of Prayer.
  - However, the traditions we have been able to find in the relevant sections of the Hadith collection do not specifically mention these conditions.
  - **It thus appears that one may perform prostration, irrespective of whether one fulfils these conditions or not**. This view is corroborated by the practice of some of the early authorities. *Bukhari, for instance, reports about 'Abd Allah b. 'Urnar that he used to perform prostration even though he would have required ablution if he wanted to perform Prayer.* (See Bukhari, Abwab Sujud al-Quran, 'Bab Sujud al-Muslimin ma' al-Mushrikin'- Ed.)
  - Likewise, it has been mentioned in Fath al-Bari about 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami that if he was reciting the Qur'an while moving, and he recited a verse calling for prostration, he would simply bow his head (rather than make full prostration).
  - And he would do that even when he was required to make ablution for Prayer, and regardless of whether he was facing the Ka'bah or not.
  - In our view, therefore, while it is preferable to follow the general opinion of the scholars on the question, it would not be blameworthy if someone deviates from that opinion. **The reason for this is that the general opinion of the scholars on this question is not supported by well-established Sunnah, and there are instances of deviation from it on the part of the early authorities**.
