**Ayat 59 - 64**

## Ayat 59

- `Indeed We sent forth Noah to his people and he said:`
  - `'0 my people! Serve Allah, you have no other god than Him Indeed I fear for you the chastisement of an awesome Day.'`

## Ayat 60

- `The leading men of his people replied:`
  - `'We see that you are in palpable error.'`


## Ayat 61

- `He said:`
  - `'0 my people! There is no error in me, but I am a Messenger from the Lord of the universe.`


## Ayat 62

- `I convey to you the messages of my Lord,`
- `give you sincere advice,`
- `and I know from Allah that which you do not know.`

## Ayat 63

- `Do you wonder that admonition should come to you from your Lord through a man from amongst yourselves`
- `that he may warn you,`
- `that you may avoid evil and`
- `that mercy may be shown to you?'`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There were striking similarities between Muhammad and Noah (peace be on them). The Prophet Muhammad (peace be on him) received the same treatment from his people as did Noah from his. 
  - The message that each of them sought to preach was also the same. Likewise, the doubts and objections raised by the people of Muhammad (peace be on him) with regard to his prophethood were the same as those raised by Noah's people several thousand years ago.
  - Again, what Muhammad (peace be on him) said in response to the doubts and objections raised against him were exactly the same as what Noah had said.
  - The Qur'anic narration of the stories of the Prophets makes it amply clear that the attitude of the nations to whom the Prophets were sent had always been the same as that of the Makkans towards the Message of Muhammad (peace be on him).
  - Apart from this, the accounts of the various Prophets and their people, display the same striking resemblances.
  - Likewise, the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be on him) vindication of his teaching in response to the Makkans is identical with similar attempts by other Prophets to vindicate their teachings.
  - So doing, the Qur'an seeks to emphasize that in the same way as the error and misguidance of which men become victims have remained essentially the same throughout the ages, the Message of God's Messengers has also been the same in all places and at all times.
  - Again, there is a striking resemblance in the ultimate fate of all those peoples who reject the message of the Prophets and who persist in their erroneous and evil ways.
  - This too has also been the same, namely utter destruction.

## Ayat 64

- `But they charged him with falsehood.`
- `Thereupon We delivered Noah and those who were with him in the Ark,`
- `and caused those who rejected Our signs as false to be drowned.`
- **`Surely they were a blind folk.`**
