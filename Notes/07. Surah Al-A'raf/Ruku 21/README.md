**Ayat 163 - 171**

## Ayat 163

- `And ask the people of Moses concerning the town situated along the sea`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Most scholars identify this place with Eilat, Eilath or Eloth. (Cf. Encyclopaedia Britannica, XV edition, 'Macropaedia', vol. 3, art. 'Elat' -Ed.)
    - The seaport called Elat which has been built by the present state of Israel (which is close to the Jordanian seaport, Aqaba), stands on the same site.
    - It lies at the end of that long inlet of the Red Sea situated between the eastern part of the Sinai peninsula and the western part of Arabia.
    - It was a major trading centre in the time of Israelite ascendancy.
    - The Prophet Solomon took this city as the chief port for his fleet in the Red Sea.
    - The event referred to in the above verse is not reported in Jewish Scriptures.
    - Nor do historical accounts shed any light on it.
    - Nonetheless, it appears from the way it has been mentioned in the above verse and in al-Baqarah that the Jews of the early days of Islam were quite familiar with the event. (See Towards Understanding the Qur'an, vol. 1, (al-Baqarah 2: 65 and n.83, pp. 81-2 - Ed)). This view is further corroborated by the fact that even the Madinan Jews who spared no opportunity to criticize the Prophet (peace be on him) did not raise any objection against this (Qur'anic account.
- `how its people profaned the Sabbath when fish came to them breaking the water's surface on Sabbath days,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - 'Sabbath', which means Saturday, was declared for the Israelites as the holi day of the week. God declared the Sabbath as a sign of the perpetual covenant between God and Israel. (Exodus 31: 12-16.) The Israelites were required to strictly keep the Sabbath which meant that they may not engage in any worldly activity; they may not cook, nor make their slaves or cattle serve them. Those who violated these rules were to be put to death.
    - **The Israelites, however, publicly violated these rules.**
    - In the days of the Prophet Jeremiah (between 628 and 586 B.C.), the Israelites carried their merchandise through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day itself. Jeremiah, therefore, warned them that if they persisted in their flagrant violation of the Law, Jerusalem would be set on fire. (Jererniah 17: 21-7.) The same complaint is voiced in the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel (595-536 B.C.) who referred to their violation of the Sabbath rules as their major sin. (Ezekiel 20: 12-24.) In view of these Scriptural references it seems plausible that the event mentioned in the above Qur'anic verse is related to the same period.
- `and would not come to them on other than Sabbath-days.`
- `Thus did We try them because of their disobedience.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Men are tested by God in a variety of ways.
    - When a person or group of people begin to turn away from God and incline themselves towards disobedience, **God provides abundant opportunities for them to disobey**. This is done in order that the full potential for disobedience, which had remained hidden because of lack of such an opportunity, might come to the surface.

## Ayat 164

- `And recall when a party of them said:`
  - **`'Why do you admonish a people whom Allah is about to destroy or punish severely?'`**
- `They said:`
  - **`'We admonish them in order to be able to offer an excuse before Your Lord, and in the hope that they will guard against disobedience.'`**


## Ayat 165

- `Then, when they forgot what they had been exhorted, We delivered those who forbade evil and afflicted the wrong-doers with a grievous chastisement1 because of their evildoing.`

## Ayat 166

- `And when they persisted in pursuing that which had been forbidden`
- `We said:`
  - **`'Become despised apes.'`**

## Ayat 167

- `And recall when Your Lord proclaimed that`
  - `'He would continually set in authority over them, till the Day of Judgement, those who would ruthless oppress thern.'`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Since the 8th century B.C. the Israelites were warned consistently. This is borne out by the contents of the Books of the Prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and their successors. Jesus too administered the same warning which is borne out by many of his orations in the New Testament, This was also later confirmed by the Qur'an. History bears out the veracity of the statement made both in the Qur'an and the earlier scriptures. For throughout history, since the time the Jews were warned, they have continually been subjected to abject persecution in one part of the world or another.
- `Surely, your Lord is swift in chastising; and yet He is All-Forgiving, All-Merciful.`

## Ayat 168

- `And We dispersed them through the earth in communities`
- `- some were righteous, others were not -`
- `and We tested them with prosperity and adversity that they may turn back (to righteousness).`

## Ayat 169

- `Then others succeeded them who inherited the scriptures, and yet kept themselves occupied in acquiring the goods of this world and kept saying:`
  - `'We shall be forgiven.'`
- `And when there comes to them an opportunity for acquiring more of those goods, they seize it.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Jews knowingly commit sins in the belief that being God's chosen people they will necessarily be pardoned and spared God's punishment. As a result of this misconception, they neither repent nor refrain from committing sins. How unfortunate the Jews are! They received the Scriptures which could have made them leaders of all mankind. But they were so petty-minded that they aspired to nothing higher than paltry worldly benefits. Thus even though they had the potential of becoming the upholders of justice and righteousness across the world they ended up merely as worshippers of this world.
- `Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth?`
- `And they have read what is in the Book`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The people of Israel know well that the Torah does not unconditionally assure them salvation. They have never been promised by God or any of His Prophets that they will attain deliverance no matter what they do. Therefore they have absolutely no right to ascribe to God something which He never told them. What makes their crime even worse is that their claim to unconditional salvation constitutes a sacrilege of their covenant with God whereby they pledged never to attribute any false statement to God.
- `and know that the abode of the Hereafter is better for the God-fearing.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The above verse has two renderings.
      - It may be either translated as above or it may be rendered thus: 'For the righteous, only the home in the Hereafter is the best.' Going by the first rendering, the verse means that salvation is not the exclusive privilege of a particular person or a family. It is absolutely out of the question that one will attain deliverance even if one commits sins, simply on account of being a Jew. A little reflection will help one realize that only the righteous and God-fearing will be rewarded in the Hereafter.
      - In the light of the second rendering, only the unrighteous prefer worldly, gains to reward in the Hereafter. As for the righteous, they are conscious of the importance of the Hereafter and hence forego worldly benefits for the sake of reward in the Next World.
- **`Do you not understand?`**

## Ayat 170

- `Those who hold fast to the Book and establish Prayer`
- `- We shall not allow the reward of such righteous men to go to waste.`

## Ayat 171

- `And recall when We shook the mountain over them as though it were a canopy, and they thought that it was going to fall over them; and We said:`
  - `'Hold firmly to that which We have given you, and remember what is in it, that you may guard against evil.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The allusion here is to the event which took place when Moses proclaimed God's Divine Law at the foot of Mount Sinai. Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God; and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. And Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire; and the smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain quaked greatly. (Exodus 19: 17-18.) This awesome atmosphere was created by God at the time when He made the people of Israel enter into a covenant with Him in order to impress upon them the gravity of the event and the supreme importance of the covenant.
  - It should not be mistakenly assumed, however, that the people of Israel, who were reluctant to make the covenant, were forced to enter into it. In fact they were all believers and had gone to the Mount merely to make the covenant.
  - The extraordinary conditions which God created were such as to make the Israelites realize that making a covenant with God was not an ordinary matter. They were rather made to feel that they were entering into a covenant with none other than Almighty God and that violating it could spell their disaster.
  - This concludes the discourse especially addressed to the Israelites.
  - From here on the discourse is directed to all mankind, and particularly to the people whom the Prophet (peace be on him) addressed directly.
