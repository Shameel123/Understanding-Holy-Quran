## Ayat 02

### Overview

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- The word 'Book', in this context, signifies this very surah, al-A'raf.
- The main purpose of this surah is to jolt the people out of their heedlessness and to warn them of the dire consequences that will follow if they reject the call of the Prophet (peace be on him). Additionally , this surah also seeks to serve as a reminder to the belivers - a purpose which is achieved, incidentally, by the warning made to the unbelievers.


- `This is a Book revealed to you.`
- `Let there be no impediment in your heart about it.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Prophet (peace be on him) is directed to preach his Message without fear and hesitation, and to disregard his opponents' response.
    - Such opponents may well be offended by his preaching of the Message, or may, hold it to ridicule, or go about maliciously twisting it, or acting with greater hostility.
    - All this notwithstanding, the Message of Islam must be preached.
    - The Arabic word haraj (which we have translated as straitness), signifies an intractable bush. (See Ibn Manzur. Lisan al 'Arab and Firuzabadi, al-qamus, q.v. 'Harajah'.)
    - 'Straitness or constriction in the breast' refers to the reluctance of a person to go ahead in the face of opposition.
    - The following Qur'anic verse would seem to allude to this mental state of the Prophet (peace he on him): **'We do indeed know how your heart feels distressed at what they say'** (al-Hijr 15: 97).
    - What painfully concerned the Prophet (peace be on him) was to find out how he could direct a people, whose adamance and opposition to truth had reached such high proportions, to the Right Way.
    - The same state of mind is again reflected in the Qur'anic verse: 'Perhaps you might feel inclined to part with a portion of what has been revealed to you, and your heart feels straitened lest they, say: "Why is a treasure not sent down unto him; or why does an angel not come with him?" ' (Hud 11:12).
- `(It has been revealed to you) that you may thereby warn [the unbelievers], that it may be a reminder to the believers.`
