**Ayat 127 - 129**

## Ayat 127

- `The elders of Pharaoh's people said:`
  - `'Will you leave alone Moses and his people to spread mischief in the land, and forsake you and your gods?'`
- `Pharaoh replied:`
  - `'We will kill their male children and spare their female ones.`
  - `For indeed we hold irresistible sway over them.'`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There were two periods of persecution.
  - The first was during the reign of Rameses 11 and took place before Moses' birth, whereas the second period of persecution started after Moses' assumption to the office of prophethood.
    - **Common to both periods is the killing of the male issue of Israelites while the female was spared.**
    - It was a calculated design to rob the Israelites of their identity and to bring about their forcible assimilation.
    - An inscription discovered during the archaeological excavations of 1896 probably belongs to this period.
    - According to this inscription, Pharaoh Minpetah rounds off the narration of his achievements and victories in these words: **'The Israel have been exterminated, and no seed of them is left.'** For further explanation see(al-Mu'min 40: 25)

## Ayat 128

  - `'Seek help from Allah and be steadfast.`

  - `He bestows it on those of His servants He chooses.`
  - **`The end of things belongs to the God-fearing.'`**

## Ayat 129

- `The people of Moses replied:`
  - `'We were oppressed before your coming to us and after it.'`
- `Moses said:`
