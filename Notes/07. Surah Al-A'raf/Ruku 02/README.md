**Ayat 11 -25**

## Ayat 11

- `We initiated your creation,`
- `then We gave you each a shape,`
- `and then We said to the angels:`
  - **`'Prostrate before Adam.'`**
- `They all prostrated except Iblis:`
- `he was not one of those who fell Prostrate.`

From the Ayat, to me, it looks like, we were first created in some form and later on we were shaped.

## Ayat 12

- `Allah said:`
  - `'What prevented you from prostrating, when I commanded you to do so?'`
- `He said:`
  - `'I am better than he.`
  - `You created me from fire, and him You created from clay.'`


## Ayat 13

- `Allah said:`
  - `'Then get you down from here. It does not behove you to be arrogant here. So be gone. You will be among the humiliated.'`

## Ayat 14

- `Satan replied:`
  - `'Give me respite till the Day they shall be raised.'`

## Ayat 15

- `Allah said:`
  - `'You are granted respite.'`

## Ayat 16

- `Satan said:`
  - `'Since You have led me astray, I shall surely sit in ambush for them on Your Straight Path.`

## Ayat 17

- `Then I will come upon them from the front and from the rear,`
- `and from their right and from their left.`
- **`And You will not find most of them thankful.'`**

Looks like Satan's aim is to make us not to thank Allah SWT.

## Ayat 18

- `Allah said:`
- `'Go away from here - disgraced and expelled.`
- `I shall fill the Hell with all those that follow you.`

## Ayat 19

- `0 Adam!`
- `Live you and your spouse in the Garden and both of you eat from it wherever you will, but never approach the tree or you shall become wrongdoers.'`

## Ayat 20

- `But Satan made an evil suggestion to both of them that he might reveal to them their shame that had remained hidden from them.`
- `He said:`
  - `'Your Lord has forbidden you to approach this tree only to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals.'`

## Ayat 21

- `And he swore to them both:`
  - `'Surely I am your sincere adviser.'`

Sometimes we get evil people like this in our lives who claim that they are our sincere advisors but instead they are the cause of our destruction.

## Ayat 22

- `Thus Satan brought about their fall by deceit.`
- `And when they tasted of the tree, their shame became vislible to them,`
- `and both began to cover themselves with leaves from the Garden.`
- `Then their Lord called out to them:`
  - **`'Did I not forbid you from that tree, and did I not warn you that Satan 'is your declared enemy?'`**

## Ayat 23

- `Both cried out:`
- `'Our Lord!`
- `We have wronged ourselves.`
- `If You do not forgive us and do not have mercy on us, we shall surely be among the losers.'`

## Ayat 24

- `Allah said:`
  - `'Go down;`
  - `you are enemies one of the other.`
  - `For you there is dwelling and provision on the earth for a while.'`


## Ayat 25

- `He continued:`
- `'You shall live there,`
- `and there shall you die,`
- `and from it you shall be raised to life.'`
