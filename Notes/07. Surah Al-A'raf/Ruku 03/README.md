**Ayat 26 - 31**

## Ayat 26

- `0 Children of Adam!`
- `Indeed We have sent down to you a garment which covers your shame and provides protection and adornment.`
- **`But the finest of all is the garment of piety.`**
- `That is one of the signs of Allah so that they may take heed.`

## Ayat 27

- `Children of Adam!`
- `Let not Satan deceive you in the manner he deceived your parents out of Paradise,`
- `pulling off from them their clothing to reveal to them their shame.`
- `He and his host surely see you from whence you do not see them.`
- `We have made satans the guardians of those who do not believe.`

## Ayat 28

- `And when such people commit an indecent act they say:`
  - `'We found our fathers doing that, and Allah has enjoined it on us.`
- `Say:`
  - **`'Surely Allah never enjoins any indecency.`**
  - `Do you say things regarding Allah that you do not know?'`

## Ayat 29

- `Say to them (O Muhammad):`
  - `'My Lord enjoins justice;`
  - `and that you set your faces aright at the time of every Prayer;`
  - `and that you call upon Him, exclusively dedicating your faith to Him.`
  - `You shall return to Him as you were created.'`

## Ayat 30

- `A party He has guided to the Right Way,`
- `and for another party straying is justly its due for they have taken satans, rather than Allah, as their guardians,`
- **`even though they think that they are rightly-guided.`**

This seems very scary.. Even the ones who are not guided think that they are..

## Ayat 31

- `Children of Adam!`
- **`Take your adornment at every time of Prayer;`**
- **`and eat and drink without going to excesses.`**
- **`For Allah does not like those who go to excess.`**
