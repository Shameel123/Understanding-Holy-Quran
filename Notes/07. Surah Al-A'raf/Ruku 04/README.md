**Ayat 32 - 39**

## Ayat 32

- `Say (O Muhammad):`
  - `'Who has forbidden the adornment which Allah has brought forth for His creatures or the good things from among the means of sustenance?'`
- `Say:`
  - `'These are for the enjoyment of the believers in this world, and shall be exclusively theirs on the Day of Resurrection.'`
- **`Thus do We clearly expound Our revelations for those who have knowledge.`**

This Ayah clearly explains that every halal thing is allowed for us and we are the ones who have made our ownselves conservative enough in the name of religion without knowledge to make them haram upon us.

## Ayat 33

- `Tell them (O Muhammad):`
  - `'My Lord has only forbidden indecent acts, whether overt or hidden;`
  - `all manner of sin;`
  - `wrongful transgression;`
  - `and [He has forbidden] that you associate with Allah in His divinity that for which He has sent down no sanction;`
  - `and that you ascribe to Allah things of which you have no sure knowledge that they are from Him.'`


## Ayat 34

- `For every community there is an appointed term;`
- **`and when its term arrives, they cannot tarry behind a moment, nor can they get ahead.`**

This term I think is completely abstract and not how we perceive it to be. I do not think (at this moment) that the term only refers to 'time'.

## Ayat 35

- `Children of Adam!`
- `If Messengers come to you from amongst yourselves who rehearse to you My signs,`
- `then those who shun disobedience and mend their ways`
- **`shall have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.`**

## Ayat 36

- `And those who reject Our revelations as false and turn away from them in arrogance,`
- `they shall be the inmates of Hell; and there shall they abide.`

## Ayat 37

- `Who is more unjust then`
  - `he who invents a falsehood, ascribing it to Allah,`
  - `or who rejects His revelation as false?`
- `Their full portion of God's Decree shall reach them,`
- `until Our deputed angels come to them to take charge of their souls, and say:`
  - `'Where are the deities now, those whom you invoked besides Allah?'`
- `They will say:`
  - `'They are all gone away from us.'`
- `And they shall bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers.`


## Ayat 38

- `Allah will say:`
  - `'Enter the fire of Hell and join the nations of jinn and men that have gone before You.'`
- `As a nation enters Hill, it will curse the one that went before it,`
- `and when all are gathered there, the last of them shall say of the first:`
  - `'Our Lord! These are the ones who led us astray.`
  - `Let their torment be doubled in Hell-Fire.'`
- `He will answer:`
  - **`'Each will have a doubled torment; although you do not know.'`**

## Ayat 39

- `Then the preceding ones will say to the succeeding ones:`
  - `'You were in no way superior to us; taste, then, this torment for your deeds.'`
