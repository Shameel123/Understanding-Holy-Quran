**Ayat 73 - 84**

## Ayat 73

- `And to Thamud We sent forth their brother. Salih.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Thamud are another ancient Arab people, next only to the 'Ad in fame.
    - Legends relating to them were quite popular in pre-Islamic Arabia.
    - In fact poetry and orations of the pre-Islamic (Jahiliyah) period abound with references to them.
    - They are also mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions and in the Greek, Alexandrian and Roman works of history and geography.
    - Some descendants of the Thamud survived to a little before the birth of Jesus.
    - The Roman historians mention that they entered into the Roman army and fought against the Nabateans, their arch-enemy.
    - The Thamud lived in the north-western part of Arabia which is still called al-Hijr.
    - In the present time there is a station on the Hijaz railway, between Madina and Tabuk.
    - This is called Mada'in Salih, which was the capital town of Thamud and was then known as al-Hijr, the rock-hewn city. This has survived to this day and is spread over thousands of acres. It was once inhabited by no less than half a million people.
    - **At the time of the revelation of the Qur'an Arab trade caravans passed through the ruins of this city. While the Prophet (peace be on him) was on his way, to Tabuk, he directed the Muslims to look upon these monuments and urged them to learn the lessons which sensible persons ought to learn from the ruins of a people that had been destroyed because of their evil-doing.**
    - **The Prophet (peace be on him) also pointed to the well from which the she-camel of the Prophet Salih used to drink. He instructed the Muslims to draw water from that well alone and to avoid all other wells.**
    - The mountain pass through which that she-camel came to drink was also indicated by the Prophet (peace be on him). The pass is still known as Fajj al-Naqah. The Prophet (peace be on him) then gathered all the Muslims who had been directed to look around that city of rocks, and addressed them.
    - **He drew their attention to the tragic end of the Thamud, who by their evil ways had invited God's punishment upon themselves. The Prophet (peace he on him) asked them to hastily move ahead for the place was a grim reminder of God's severe punishment and he hence called for reflection and repentance.** 
      - (See waqidi, al-maghazi, vol. 3, pp. 1006-8. See also the comments of Ibn Kathir on verses 73-8 - Ed.)
- `He said to them:`
  - `'0 my people!`
  - `Serve Allah, you have no other god than Him.`
  - `Truly there has come to you a clear proof from your Lord.`
  - `This she-camel from Allah is a Divine portent for you.`
  - `So leave her alone to pasture on Allah's earth,`
  - `and touch her with no evil lest a painful chastisement should seize you.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran
  - The context seems to indicate that the clear proof referred to in the verse stands for the she-camel which is also spoken of as 'a Divine portent'.
  - In( al-Shu'ara' 26: 154-8) it is explicitly mentioned that the Thamud themselves had asked the Prophet Salih to produce some sign which would support his claim to be God's Messenger. Responding to it, Salih pointed to the she-camel. This illustrates clearly that the appearance of the she-camel was a miracle.
  - Similar miracles had been performed earlier by other Prophets with a view to fulfilling the demand of the unbelievers and thus of vindicating their claim to prophethood.
  - The miraculous appearance of the she-camel reinforces the fact that Salih had presented it as a 'Divine portent' and warned his people of dire consequences if they harmed it. He explained to them that the she-camel would graze freely in their fields; that on alternate days she and other animals would drink water from their well, They were also warned that if they harmed the she-camel they would be immediatelv seized by a terrible chastisemen' from God. Such statements could obviously only have been made about an animal which was known to be of a miraculous nature.
  - The Thamud observed the she-camel graze freely in their fields and she and the other camels drank water on alternate days from their well. The Thamud, though unhappy with the situation, endured this for quite some time. Later, however, after prolonged deliberations, **they killed her**.
  - *Such lengthy deliberations demonstrate that they were afraid to kill the she-camel.*
  - It is clear that the object of their fear was none other than the she-camel as they had no reason to be afraid of Salih, who had no power to terrify them.
  - Their sense of awe for the she-camel explains why they let her graze freely on their land.
  - The Qur'an, however, does not provide any detailed information as to what the she-camel looked like or how she was born. The authentic Hadith too provide no information about its miraculous birth. Hence, one need not take too seriously the statements of some of the commentators on the Qur'an about the mode of her birth. However, as far as the fact of her miraculous birth is concerned, that is borne out bv the Qur'an itself.

## Ayat 74

- `And call to mind when He made you successors after 'Ad`
- `and gave you power in the earth`
- `so that you took for yourselves palaces in its plains`
- `and hewed out dwellings in the mountains.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Thamud were highly skilful in rock-carving, and made huge mansions by carving the mountains, as we have mentioned earlier see (n. 57 )above. In this regard the works of the Thamud resemble the rock-carvings in the Ajanta and Ellora caves in India and several other places.
    - A few buildings erected by the Thamud are still intact in Mada'in Salih and speak of their tremendous skills in civil engineering and architecture.
- `Remember, then, the wondrous bounties of Allah and do not go about creating mischief in the land.'`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Qur'an asks people to draw a lesson from the tragic end of the 'Ad.
    - For just as God destroyed that wicked people and established Muslims in positions of power and influence previously occupied by them,
    - He can also destroy the Muslims and replace them by Others if they should become wicked and mischievous.
      - (For further elaboration see (n. 52 )above.

## Ayat 75

- `The haughty elders of his people said to those believers who had been oppressed:`
  - `'Do you know that Salih is one sent forth with a message from his Lord?'`
- `They, replied:`
  - `'Surely we believe in the message with which he has been sent.'`

## Ayat 76

- `The haughty ones remarked.`  
  - **`'Most certainly we disbelieve in that which you believe.'`**

## Ayat 77

- `Then they hamstrung the she-camel,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **Although the she-camel was killed by an individual, as we learn also from surahs al-Qamar (54) and al-Sharns (91), the whole nation was held guilty since it stood at the killer's back.**
      - I need to confirm if this also counts rebillion which occured after the shahadat of Hazar Usman R.A. 
    - **Every sin which is committed with the approval and support of a nation, is a national crime even if it has been committed by one person. In fact the Qur'an goes a step further and declares that a sin which is committed publicly in the midst of a gathering is considered to be the collective sin of the people who tolerate it.**
- `disdainfuliy disobeyed the commandment of their Lord, and said:`
  - **`'0 Salih! Bring upon us the scourge with which you threatened us if you are truly a Messenger [of Allah].'`**

## Ayat 78

- `Thereupon a shocking catastrophe seized them,`
- `so that they lay prostrate in their dwellings.`

## Ayat 79

- `And Salih left them, saying:`
  - `'O my people! I conveyed to you the message of my Lord and gave you good advice; but you have no liking for your well-wishers.'`

## Ayat 80

- `And remember when We sent Lot [as a Messeng to his people and he said to them:`
- `'Do you realize you practise an indecency of which no other people in the world were guilty of before you?`

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- The land inhabited by the people of Lot, which lies between Iraq and Palestine, is known as Trans-Jordan.
- According to the Bible, its capital town was Sodom, which is situated either somewhere near the Dead Sea, or presently lies submerged under it.
- Apart from Sodom, according to the Talmud, there were four other majour cities, and the land lying between these cities was dotted with such greenery and orchards that the whole area looked like one big garden enchanting any onlooker.
- However, the whole nation was destroyed and today wc can find no trace of it.
- So much so that it is difficult to even locate the main cities which they inhabited. 
- If anything remains as a reminder of this nation it is the Dead Sea which is also called the Sea of Lot.
- **The Prophet Lot who was a nephew of the Prophet Abraham**, accompanied his uncle as he moved away from Iraq.
- Lot sojourned to Syria, Palestincand Egypt forawhile and gained practical experience of preaching his message.
- **Later God bettowed prophethood upon him and assigned to him the mission of reforming his misguided people.**
- The people of Sodom have been referred to as the people of Lot presumably because Lot may have established matrimonial ties with those people. One of the many accusations recorded gainst Lot in the Bible - and the Bible has been tampered with extensively by the Jews - is that Lot migrated to Sodom after an argument with Abraham (Genesis 13: 10-12). The Qur'an refutes this baseless charge and affirms that Lot was designated by God to work as His Messenger among his people.
- The author refers to an argument between Abraham and Lot which he considers to be a fabrication of Jews.The obvious basis of this is that such an argument between the Prophets is inconceivable since it is unbecoming of them as Prophets.
- The basis of this inference is a statement in Genesis 13:1-12.
- It seems that there has been some confusion with regard to this inference.
- The verses of Genesis in question make no reference to any strife between the two Prophets.
- The strife to which it refers allegedly took place between the two Prophets
- In addition, when the two Prophets parted company it was on a pleasant note for Abraham had suggested that since there was an abundance of land, Lot should choose that part of the land he preffered so as to exclude all possibilities of strife between their herdsmen. (See Genesis 13:1-5-Ed.)

## Ayat 81

- `You approach men lustfully in place of women.`
- `You are a people who exceed all bounds.'`

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- The Qur'an refers elsewhere to the many evil deeds of the people of Lot.
- Here the Qur'an confines itself to mentioning that most ignominious of crimes which invited God's scourge upon them.
- The hideous act of sodomy, for which the people of Lot earned notoriety, has no doubt been committed by perverts in all times.
- The Greeks philosophers had the distinction of glorifying it as a moral virtue.
- It was left, however, for the modern West to vigorously propagate sodomy so much so that it was declared legal by the legislatures of a few countries.
- All this has been done in the face of the obvious fact that this form of sexual intercourse is patently unnatural.
- God created distinctions between the sexes of all living beings for the purposes of reproduction and perpetuation of the species.
- As far as the human species is concerned, their creation into two sexes is related to another end as well: that the two should come together in order to bring into existence the family and establish human civilization.
- In view of this, not only were human beings divided into two sexes, but each sex was made attractive to the other. The physical structure and psychological make-up of each sex was shaped in keeping with the purpose of forging bonds of mutual cordiality between the members of the two sexes. The sexual act, which is intensely pleasurable is at once a factor leading to the fulfilment of nature's purposes as underlined by the sexual division of humankind as well as a reward for fulfilling these purposes.
- **Now, the crime of the person who commits sodomy in flagrant opposition to this scheme of things, is not limited to that act alone. In fact he commits along with it a number of other crimes.**
  - First, he wages war against his own nature, against his inherent psychological predilection.
  - This causes a major disorder which leads to highly negative effects on the lives of both the parties involved in that unnatural act - effects which are physical, psychological as well as moral.
  - Second, he acts dishonestly with nature since while he derives sexual pleasure he fails to fulfil the societal obligation of which this pleasure is a recompense.
  - Third, such a person also acts dishonestly with human society. For, although he avails himself of the advantages offered by various social institutions, when he has an opportunity to act, he uses his abilities in a manner which not only fails to serve that society but which positively harms it.
    - Apart from neglecting the abligations he owes to society, he renders himself incapable of serving the human race and his own family.
    - He also produces effeminacy in at least one male and potentially pushes at least two females towards sexual corruption and moral depravity.


## Ayat 82

- `Their only answer was:`
  - `'Banish them from your town.`
  - `They are a people who pretend to be pure.'`


Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It is evident from the present verse that the people of Lot Were not only shameless and corrupt, but were also a people who had sunk in moral depravity to such a degree that **even the presence of a few righteous persons had become intolerable to them**. 
  - Their moral degradation left them with no patience for anyone who sought to bring about any moral reform.
  - Even the slightest element of purity found in their society was too much for them, and they simply wished to have their society purged of it.
  - When these people reached such a low point of wickedness and hostility to good, God decreed that they be wiped out altogether.
  - When the collective life of a people becomes totally bereft of goodness and purity, it forfeits the right to exist on earth.
  - Their example is like that of a basket of fruit. As long as some fruit remains firm, there is some justification to keep that basket. But the basket has to be thrown away when the fruit becomes rotten.

## Ayat 83

- **`Then We delivered Lot and his household save his wife who stayed behind,`**

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- As the Qur'an mentions elsewhere, Lot's wife supported her disbelieving relatives to the last.
- Hence, when God directed Lot and his followers to migrate from that corrupt land, He ordained that Lot's wife be left behind. This seems to be an inference from( al- Tahrim 66: 10 - Ed).

## Ayat 84

- `and We let loose a shower [of stones] upon them,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The 'rainfall' in the verse does not refer to the descent of water from the sky. It refers rather to the volley of stones. The Qur'an itself mentions that their habitations were turned upside down and ruined. See (verse 85); also (Hud 11:82-3); (al-Hijr 15:74-E)
- `Observe, then, the end of the evil-doers.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In light of this verse and other references in the Qur'an, **sodomy is established as one of the deadliest sins**; and that it incurred God's scourge on those who indulged in it.
    - We also know from the teachings of the Prophet (peace be on him) that the Islamic state should purge society of this crime and severely punish those guilty of it. 
    - There are several traditions from the Prophet (peace be on him) which mention that very severe punishments were inflicted on both partners of this act.
    - **According to one tradition, the Prophet (peace be on him) ordered that both partners be put to death.** (See Ibn Majah, Kitab al-Hudud, 'Bab man 'amila 'Amal Qawm ut'- Ed.)
    - **In another tradition it has been added that the culprits should be put to death whether they are married or un-married.** (Ibn Majah, Kitab al-Hudad - Ed.)
    - **In another tradition it has been said that both parties should be stoned (to death).** (Ibn Majah, Kitab al-Hudad, 'Bab man 'amila 'Amal Qawm Lut ' - Ed.) 
    - However, since no case of sodomy was reported in the lifetime of the Prophet (peace be on him), the punishment did not acquire a very clear and definitive shape. 
    - Among the Companions, 'Ali is of the view that such sinners should be beheaded and instead of being buried should be cremated. Abu Bakr also held the same view. 
    - However, 'Urnar and 'Uthman suggest that the sinners be made to stand under the roof of a dilapidated building, which should then be pulled down upon them.
    - Ibn 'Abbas holds the view that those guilty of such a sinful act should be thrown from the top of the tallest building of the habitation and then pelted with stones. (See al-Fiqh 'ala al-Madhahib al-Arba'ah, vol. 5, pp. 141-2 - Ed.)
    - As for the jurists, Shafi pronounces the punishment of death on both partners to sodomy irrespective of their marital status, and of their role whether it be active or passive.
    - According to Sha'bi, Zuhri, Malik and Ahmad b. Hanbal, they should be stoned to death. Sa'id b. al-Musayyib, 'Ata', Hasan Basri, Ibrahim Nakha'i, Sufyan Thawri and Awa'i believe that such sinners deserve the same punishment as laid down for unlawful sexual-intercourse: that unmarried ones should be lashed a hundred times and exiled, and that married ones should be stoned to death. Abu Hanifah, however, does not recommend any specific punishment.
    - For him, the sinner should be awarded, depending on the circumstances of each case, some deterrent punishment.
    - According to one of the reports, the same was the view of Shafi'i. (See Ibn Qudamah, al-Mughni, vol. 8, pp. 187-8 - Ed.)
    - **It should also be made clear that it is altogether unlawful for the husband to perpetrate this act on his wife.** The Prophet (peace be on him), according to a tradition in Abu Da'ud, said: **'Cursed be he who commits this act with a woman.'** (Abu Da'ud, Kitab al-Nikah, 'Bab fi Jami ' al Nikah' - Ed.) In other collections of Hadith such as Sunan of Ibn Majah and Musnad of Ahmad b. Hanbal. we find the following saying of the Prophet (peace be on him): **'God will not even look at him who commits this act of sodomy with his wife in her rectum.'** (Ibn Majah, Kitab al-Nikah', 'Bab al-Nahy'an Ityan al-Nisa' fi Adbarihinn', Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 2, p. 344 - Ed.)
    - Likewise the following saying of the Prophet (peace be on him) is mentioned in Tirmidhi: **'He who makes sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman, or indulges in sodomy with a woman. or calls on a soothsayer, believing him to be true, denies the faith sent down to Muhammad (peace be on him).'** (Ibn Majah, Kitab al-Taharah, 'Bab al-Nahy 'an ityan al-Ha'id'- Ed.)
