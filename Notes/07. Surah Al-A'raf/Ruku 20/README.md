**Ayat 158 - 162**

## Ayat 158

- `[Say, O Muhammad]:`
  - `'O men!`
  - `I am Allah's Messenger to you all - `
  - `of Him to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth.`
  - `There is no god but He.`
  - `He grants life and deals death.`
  - `Have faith then, in Allah and in His Messenger,`
  - `the ummi Prophet who believes in Allah and His words;`
  - `and follow him so that you may be guided aright.'`

## Ayat 159

- `Among the people of Moses'`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:    
    - This marks the resumption of the main theme of the discourse which had been interrupted by the parenthesis see (verses 157-8)calling people to affirm the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be on him).
- `there was a party who guided others in the way of the truth and established justice in its light.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The translators generally render the verse as the following:
      - Of the people of Moses there is a section who guide and do justice in the light of truth. (Translation by Abdullah Yusuf Ali.)
      - They do so because, in their view, the present verse describes the moral and intellectual state of the Israelites at the time when the Qur'an was revealed. 
      - However, the context seems to indicate that the above account refers to the state of the Israelites at the time of the Prophet Moses.
      - Thus, the purpose of the verse is to emphasize that even in the days of their calf-worship when God rebuked them, all members of Israel were not corrupt; that a sizeable section of them was righteous.

## Ayat 160

- `And We divided them into twelve tribes, forming them into communities.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This refers to the organization of the people of Israel which has been mentioned in the Qur'an in (al-Ma'idah 5:12 )and also described, at length, in the Bible in Numbers.
    - According to these sources, in compliance with God's command the Prophet Moses first conducted the census of the Israelites in the wilderness of Sinai.
    - He registered their twelve tribes, ten of whom were descendants of the Prophet Jacob, and the remaining two descendants of the Prophet Joseph, as separate and distinct tribes.
    - He appointed a chief for each tribe and assigned to him the duty to maintain moral, religious, social and military discipline within each tribe and to enforce the Law.
    - The Levites, who were descendants of the Prophets Moses and Aaron, however, were organized as a distinct group entrusted with the task of providing religious guidance to all tribes.
- `When his people asked Moses for water We directed him:`
  - **`'Smite the rock with your rod.'`**
- `Then twelve springs gushed forth from the rock and every people knew their drinking-places.`
- `And We caused thick clouds to provide them shade, and We sent down upon them manna and quails,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This organization was one of the numerous favours which God had bestowed upon the Israelites.
    - Mention is made of three other favours bestowed upon them.
      1. First, an extraordinary arrangement for their water supply was made in the otherwise arid Sinai peninsula.
      2. Second, the sky was covered with clouds such that they were protected from the scorching heat of the sun.
      3. Third, a unique meal, consisting of manna and quails was sent down on them.
    - Had this Divine arrangement, catering as it did for the millions of wandering Israelites' basic necessities of life, not been made, they would certainly have perished.
    - On visiting that land even today it is difficult to visualize how such an arrangement providing shelter, food and water for millions of people was made.
    - The population of this peninsula standseven today at a paltry, 55,000 people. (it may be noted that this statement was made in the fifties of the present century. However, the present population of the Sinai is 200,000 - Ed.)
    - If a five or six hundred thousand strong army, were to camp there today, it would be quite a task for those at the helm to provide the necessary supplies for the army.
    - Little wonder, then, that many scholars who belive neither in the Scripture nor in miracles, rule out the historical accuracy of the event.
    - For them, the people of Israel camped in an area lying south of Palestine and north of Arabia.
    - In view of the physical and economic geography of the Sinai peninsula, they consider it totally incredible that such a large population could have stayed there for years.
    - What has made these scholars even more sceptical about the event is the fact that the Israelites were not then in a position to procure supplies from either the Egyptians or the 'Amaliqah' who inhabited respectively the eastern and northern parts of the peninsula, since both groups were hostile to them.
    - It is against this background that one may appreciate the immense importance of the favours God conferred on the Israelites. 
    - Likewise, it also gives one some idea of the blatant ingratitude of the people of Israel since they consistently defied and betrayed God even though they had witnessed a great many divine signs. (See Towards Understanding the Qur'an, vol. 1,(al-Baqarah 2: nn. 72-3 and 76, pp. 76-7 - Ed.)
- `saying:`
  - **`'Eat of the clean things that We have provided you.'`**
- `They wronged not Us, but it was themselves that they wronged.`


## Ayat 161

- `And recall when it was said to them:`
  - `'Dwell in this town and eat plentifully of whatever you please, and say: "Repentance", and enter the gate prostrate.`
  - `We shall forgive you your sins and shall bestow further favours on those who do good.'`


## Ayat 162

- `Then the wrong-doers among them substituted another word in place of the one told them.`
- `So We sent upon them a scourge from the heaven as a punishment for their Wrong-doing`
