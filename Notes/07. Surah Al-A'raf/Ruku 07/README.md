**Ayat 54 - 58**

## Ayat 54

- `Surely your Lord is none other than Allah,`
- `Who created the heavens and the earth in six days,`
- `and then ascended His Throne;`
- `Who causes the night to cover the day and then the day swiftly pursues the night;`
- `Who created the sun and the moon and the stars making them all subservient to His command.`
- `Lo! His is the creation and His is the command.`
- `Blessed is Allah,`
  - `the Lord of the universe.`


## Ayat 55

- `Call upon your Lord with humility and in secret.`
- `Surely He does not love transgressors.`

## Ayat 56

- `And do not make mischief in the earth after it has been set in order,`
- `and call upon Him with fear and longing.`
- `Surely Allah's mercy is close to those who do good.`

## Ayat 57

- `And it is He Who sends forth winds as glad tidings in advance of His Mercy,`
- `and when they have carried a heavy-laden cloud`
- `We drive it to a dead land, then We send down rain from it and bring forth therwith fruits of every kind.`
- **`In this manner do We raise the dead that you may take heed.`**

This surely has some in-depth meaning that I cannot figure out right now...

## Ayat 58

- `As for the good land,`
- `vegetation comes forth in abundance by the command of its Lord,`
- `whereas from the bad land, only poor vegetation comes forth.`
- **`Thus do We expound Our signs in diverse ways for a people who are grateful.`**
