**Ayat 31 - 36**

## Ayat 31

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The allusion is to the pagans of Arabia, who did not believe in any divine Book.

- `The unbelievers say:`
  - `“We shall never believe in this Qur'an, nor in any Scripture before it.”`
- `If you could only see the wrong-doers arrayed before their Lord, each bandying charges against the other.`
- `Those who were suppressed will say to those who waxed arrogant:`
  - `“Had it not been for you, we would have been believers.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the common people who are following their leaders, chiefs, saints and rulers blindly, and are not prepared to listen to any word of advice from a well-wisher against them. When the same people will sec the actual reality and will also remember how their religious leaders used to misrepresent things, and when they will realize what doom they are going to meet on account of following their leaders, they will turn on them, and say, “O wretched people, you led us astray: you are responsible for all our afflictions. Had you not misguided us, we would have listened to the Messengers of Allah and believed in what they said.

## Ayat 32

- `The arrogant ones will retort to those who were suppressed:`
  - `“What! Did we bar you from the guidance after it came to you? Not at all; rather you yourselves were evil-doers.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, they will say: We had no power by which a few of us could have compelled hundreds of thousands of the people like you to follow us. If you had the will to believe, you could have deposed us from leadership and power and authority and government. In fact, you were our army, you were the source of our wealth and power. But for your offerings and gifts and taxes we should have been paupers. Had you not sworn allegiance to us, we could not have flourished as saints even for a day. Had you not appreciated and applauded us as leaders, we would have remained unknown. Had you not become our army and fought against the whole world for our sake, we could not have ruled over a single individual. **Now why don’t you admit that you yourselves did not want to follow the way that the Messengers had presented before you.** **You were the slaves of your own lusts and desires, and the demands of your selves could not be fulfilled by the righteous way of life presented by the Messengers but by what we presented before you.** You were heedless of the lawful and the unlawful and craved for the luxuries of life, which we only could provide you. You were in search of such guides as could give you the license to commit any sin, any crime, and take on themselves the responsibility to have you forgiven by God, in exchange for gifts. **You wanted to listen to such religious scholars only who could please you by proving every kind of shirk and every innovation in religion and every lust of your self to be the very truth. You needed such forgers who could invent a new religion by altering the religion of God after your desires.** You wanted to follow such leaders who could help you become prosperous in this world, no matter how you fared in the Hereafter. You wished to have such rulers who were immoral and dishonest so that under their patronage you also could have the freedom to indulge in any sin, any immorality. **Thus, you and we were equal partners in the bargain.** Now you cannot delude anyone by saying that you were absolutely innocent and that we had spoiled and corrupted you against your will.


## Ayat 33

- `Those who were suppressed will say to those who waxed arrogant:`
  - `“By no means; it was your scheming, night and day, when you would enjoin us to disbelieve in Allah and set up others as equals to Him.”`
- `When they are confronted with the chastisement, they will be remorseful in their hearts.`
- `We shall put fetters around the necks of the unbelievers.`
- **`Can people be requited except for their deeds?`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In other words, the common people’s reply will be: “How can you hold us as equal partners in this responsibility? Do you also remember what sort of trickeries and deceptions and false propaganda you practiced and what efforts you used to make to tempt and entice the people day and night. It is not just that you presented the world before us and we were allured, but this is also a fact that you used to befool us by your frauds and deceptions and each one of you brought a new bait every day to tempt and lure the simple people.”


## Ayat 34

- `We never sent a warner to any town but its wealthy ones said:`
  - `“We disbelieve in the Message you have brought.”`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That the message of the Prophets was first of all opposed and resisted by the well-to-do people who possessed wealth and influence and authority. This has been stated at many places in the Quran. For instance, see (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayat 123); (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 60, 66, 75, 88, 90); (Surah Hud, Ayat 27); (Surah Bani-Israil, Ayat 16); (Surah Al-Muminun, Ayats 24, 33 to 38, 46, 47); (Surah Az- Zukhruf, Ayat 23).

## Ayat 35

- `They always said:`
  - `“We have more wealth and children than you have, and we shall not be chastised.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Their reasoning was: “We are greater favorites of Allah than you. That is why He has favored us with the blessings of which you are deprived, or have received them in lesser measure. Why should Allah have given us all these provisions and wealth and power, had He not been pleased with us? Now, how can we believe that Allah Who is showering us with all kinds of His blessings here will punish us in the Hereafter? He will punish only those who are deprived of His favors here,”

## Ayat 36

- `(O Prophet), say to them:`
  - `“My Lord grants provision abundantly to whomsoever He pleases and straitens it for whomsoever He pleases. But most people do not know this.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - They do not understand the wisdom on which the system of the distribution of provisions is based in the world, and are thus involved in the misunderstanding that whoever is being given abundantly is a beloved of Allah and whoever is being given sparingly is under His wrath. The fact, however, is that if a person looks around with open eyes he will see that in most cases the people with filthy and repulsive character are prosperous, and many good and noble people, who are known and recognized as morally pure, are found living in poverty. Now, how can a sensible person say that Allah dislikes the people of pure character and favors the wicked wrongdoers?
