**Ayat 10 - 21**

## Ayat 10

- `We bestowed Our favour upon David.`
- `(We commanded):`
  - `“O mountains, sing Allah's praises with him”;`
- `(and so did We command) the birds.`
- `We softened the iron for him, (saying):`

- Tafhim-ul-Quran:
  - This is an allusion to the countless favors with which Allah had blessed the Prophet David (peace be upon him). He was an ordinary young man of the tribe of Judah, living at Bethlehem. In a campaign against the Philistines **he slew the giant Goliath**, the great enemy of Israel, and **suddenly grew in esteem of the Israelites**. With this event began his rise to prominence; so much so that **after the death of Saul he was first elected king of Judah in Hebron,** and then a few years later **he was made king over all the tribes of Israel**. He took Jerusalem and made it the capital of the kingdom of Israel. It was under his leadership that for the first time in history a **God-worshipping kingdom was established**, whose boundaries extended from the Gulf of Aqabah to the western banks of the River Euphrates. In addition to these favors, he was further **graced with Divine bounties in the form of knowledge and wisdom, and the qualities of justice and mercy and devotion to the truth.** (For details, see (E.N. 273 of Surah Al-Baqarah )and (E.N. 7 of Surah Bani Israil).)

## Ayat 11

- `“Fashion coats of mail and measure their links with care and act righteously. I am watching over whatever you do.”`

## Ayat 12

- `And We subdued the wind to Solomon:`
- `its morning course was a month's journey and its evening course was a month's journey.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - For this refer to( Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayat 81 and E.N. 74) thereof.
- `We gave him a spring flowing with molten brass,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - For this refer to( Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayat 81 and E.N. 74) thereof.
- `and We subdued for him jinn who, by his Lord's permission, worked before him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The question whether the jinns who had been subdued to the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) were human beings of the mountain tribes or really the jinns who are well known by this name as the hidden creation has been discussed in detail in our commentary of Surah Al-Anbiya and Surah An-Naml. (See(E.N. 75 of Surah Al-Anbiya) and (E.Ns 23, 45) and (52 of Surah An-Naml).)
- `Such of them as swerved from Our commandment, We let them taste the chastisement of the Blazing Fire.`

## Ayat 13

- `They made for him whatever he would desire:`
  - `stately buildings,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The word tamatheel in the text is the plural of timthal, which in Arabic is used for every such thing as is made to resemble a natural thing, whether it is a human being, an animal, a tree, a flower, a river, or some inanimate object. Timthal is the name of every artificial thing which may have been made to resemble something made by God. (Lisan al-Arab). Timthal is every such picture which may have been made to resemble the likeness of something else, whether living or dead.” (The commentary, Al-Kashshaf).
      - On this basis the statement of the Quran does not necessarily imply that the images made for the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) were the pictures or images of human beings and animals. They might have been floral designs or natural landscape or different kinds of decorations with which the Prophet Solomon might have decorated his buildings and works
  - `images,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The misunderstanding has been created by some commentators who have stated that the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) had gotten the pictures of the Prophets and the angels made for himself.
      - They took such things from the Israelite traditions and then explained them saying that in the former Shariahs it was not forbidden to make the pictures. But while accepting and citing these traditions without question, these scholars did not keep in mind the fact that the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) was a follower of the Mosaic law and in that law making of the pictures and images of human beings and animals was also forbidden as it is in the Shariah of Muhammad (peace be upon him).
      - And they also did not remember that because of the enmity which a section of the Israelites bore against the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him), they have accused him of crimes like polytheism, idolatry, sorcery and adultery. Therefore. one should not place reliance on the Israelite traditions and accept anything about this great Prophet, which might contradict any Shariah enjoined by God.
      - Everyone knows that all the Prophets who came after the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) till the Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) among the Israelites were the followers of the Torah, and none of them had brought forth a new law, which might have abrogated the law of the Torah. Now the Torah clearly enjoins repeatedly that making of the pictures and images of human beings and animals is absolutely forbidden.
      - **“Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in the heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.”**
        - (Exod. 20: 4)
      - **“Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, nor rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it.”**
        - (Levit. 26: 1).
  - `basins like water-troughs and`
  - `huge, built-in-cauldrons:`
- `“Work, O house of David, in thankfulness (to your Lord).`
- `Few of My servants are truly thankful.”`


## Ayat 14

- `When We executed Our decree of death on Solomon, nothing indicated to the jinn that he was dead except a worm eating away his staff.`
- `So when Solomon fell down, the jinn realised that had they known what lies in the realm beyond perception,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Another meaning of the sentence can be: "The true state and condition of the jinns became clear and exposed. "According to the first meaning, it will mean: “The jinns realized that their claim to have the knowledge of the unseen was wrong.” According to the second, it will mean: “The people who thought that the jinns possessed the knowledge of the unseen, came to know that they had no such knowledge.”
- `they would not have continued to be in this humiliating chastisement.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Some modern commentators have interpreted it as follows: As the Prophet Solomon’s (peace be upon him) son, Rehoboam, was unworthy and given to luxurious living and surrounded by flatterers, he could not sustain the heavy burden of responsibility that fell on his shoulders after the death of his great father.
    - A short time after his succession, the kingdom collapsed, and the frontier tribes (i.e. of the jinns), whom the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) had subdued by his mighty power, rebelled and broke away.
    - But this interpretation does not at all conform to the words of the Quran. The scene depicted by the words of the Quran is somewhat like this:
      - Death came to the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him) in a state when he was standing or sitting with the support of a staff. His body stood in place due to the staff, and the jinns continued to perform their duties and services, thinking that he was living. At last, when the wood louse started eating away the staff and it became hollow from within, the Prophet Solomon’s (peace be upon him) body fell down; then the jinns realized that he had died. After all, why should this clear and unambiguous description of the event be construed to mean that the wood louse implied the unworthiness of the Prophet Solomon’s son, and the staff implied his power and authority and the falling down of his body implied the disintegration of his kingdom? Had Allah meant to say all this, there was no shortage of the words in the vast Arabic language. The Quran, in fact, has nowhere used such enigmatic language. How could the common Arabs, who were its first addressees, have solved this riddle?

## Ayat 15

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - To understand the continuity of the subject matter one should keep in view the theme as expressed in( Ayats 1-9). There it has been pointed out that the pagans of Arabia regarded the coming of the Hereafter as irrational, and declared openly that the Messenger (peace be upon him) who was presenting this doctrine was either a mad man or deliberately was fabricating falsehood.
  - In reply to this, Allah first gave some rational arguments, which we have elaborated in (E.Ns 7, 8 and 12 )above. Then in (Ayats 10-21) the story of the Prophets David and Solomon and of Saba has been related as an historical argument, which is meant to impress the reality that the history of the human species on the earth itself testifies to the law of retribution.
  - If man studies his own history carefully, he will see that this world is not a lawless kingdom, which might be functioning blindly, but it is being ruled by an All-Hearing and All- Seeing Being, Who treats and deals with His grateful servants in one way and with the ungrateful and thankless people in quite another way.
  - If one wants one can learn this lesson from the same history that in the Kingdom of God which has such a character, goodness and evil cannot have one and the same result. The necessary demand of its justice is that a time must come when goodness should be fully rewarded and evil fully punished.
- `For Sheba there was also a Sign in their dwelling place:`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, a sign of this that whatever they have is the gift of some one else and not of their own creation, and a sign of this that the one worthy of their service and worship and gratitude is that God who has blessed them with these favors and not those who have no share in bestowing these, and a sign of this that their wealth is not imperishable but can perish even as it has been amassed.
- `the two gardens to the right and to the left.“`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This does not mean that there were only two gardens in the whole country, but that the entire land of Saba was like a garden. Wherever a man stood, he could see a garden on his right and a garden on his left.
- `Eat of your Lord's provision, and render thanks to Him.`
- `Most pleasant is your land and Most Forgiving is your Lord.”`

## Ayat 16

- `But they turned away`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they adopted the way of disobedience and ingratitude instead of obedience and gratefulness.
- `and so We let loose upon them a devastating flood`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word arim as used in sayl al-arim in the text is derived from the South Arabic word ariman, which stands for a dam.
    - In the ancient inscriptions that have been unearthed in the ruins of the Yaman, this word has been commonly used in this meaning. For example, in an inscription dated 542 or 543 A.D. which Abraha, the Abyssinian governor of the Yaman, had gotten installed after the repairs to the great dam of Maarib, this word has been used repeatedly in the meaning of a dam. Therefore, sayl al- arim implies a flood that comes when a dam breaks.
- `that swept away the dams and replaced their gardens by two others bearing bitter fruits, tamarisks, and a few lote trees.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, as a result of the flood that came after the dam burst, the whole land was laid waste. The canals which the Sabaeans had dug out by building dams between the mountains were ruined and the irrigation system destroyed. Then the same land which had been like a garden before became a jungle of wild growth and no eatable plants were left in it except the small plume like fruit of the lote bushes.


## Ayat 17

- `Thus did We retribute them for their ingratitude.`
- `And none do We retribute in this manner except the utterly ungrateful.`

## Ayat 18

- `We placed other prominent towns between them,`
- `the towns that We had blessed and had set well-measured stages between them.`
- `Move back and forth between them, night and day, in perfect security.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Towns which We had blessed”: The lands of Syria and Palestine, which have been generally mentioned in the Quran by this title. For instance, in (Surah Al-Aaraf, Atyat 137), (Surah Bani-Israil, Ayat 1), (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 71, 81).

## Ayat 19

- `But they said:`
  - `“Lord, make the stages of our journeys longer.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - They may not have prayed thus in so many words. As a matter of fact, whoever is ungrateful to Allah for His blessings, tells Allah, as if to say that he is not worthy of those blessings.
      - Likewise, the nation which abuses the bounties of Allah, in fact, prays to Him, as if to say, “Our Lord, withdraw Your blessings from us, we are not worthy of these.”
      - Moreover, the words in the text also seem to suggest that the Sabaeans perhaps regarded their large population as a calamity for themselves, and they also wanted like the other foolish people that their population should fall.
- `They wronged their own selves so We reduced them to bygone tales, and utterly tore them to pieces.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, the people of Saba were so dispersed in all directions that their dispersion became proverbial. Even today when the Arabs have to mention the complete dispersion of any people they refer to the people of Saba as an example. 
      - When Allah caused His blessings to be withdrawn from them, the different tribes of the Sabaeans started leaving their homes and migrating to other parts of Arabia.
      - The Banu Ghassan went to settle in Jordan and Syria, the Aus and Khazraj in Yathrib, and the Khuzaah in Tihamah near Jeddah. The Azd left for Uman and the Bani Lakhm and Judham and Kindah were also forced to give up their homes for other places. Thus, the Sabaeans ceased to exist as a nation and became a mere legend.
- `Verily there are Signs in this for everyone who is steadfast and thankful.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - In this context the “steadfast and grateful” implies every such person (or persons) who does not lose his balance after he has received blessings from Allah, nor exults at prosperity, nor becomes heedless of God Who has blessed him with these. Such a person can learn great lessons from the history of those people who adopted the way of disobedience after attaining opportunities for progress and prosperity and ultimately met with their doom.

## Ayat 20

- `Iblis found his estimate of them to be true, and they followed him, except a party of the believers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - History shows that in ancient times there lived among the Sabaeans a small group of the people, who believed in one God, apart from all other gods. The inscriptions that have been discovered in the ruins of Yaman as a result of modern archaeological research point to the existence of this small element.
  - Some inscriptions of the period about 650 B.C. indicate that at several places in the kingdom of Saba there existed such houses of worship as were exclusively meant for the worship of dhu-samavi or dhusamaavi (i.e. Rabb as-samaa: Lord of the heavens).
  - In some places this Deity has been mentioned as Malikan dhusamavi (the King who is the Owner of the heavens).
  - This remnant of the Sabaeans continued to live in Yaman for centuries afterwards. 
  - Thus, in an inscription of 378 A.D. there is also mention of a house of worship built in the name of Ilah dhu-semevi.\
  - Then, in an inscription dated 465 A.D. the words are; Bi-nasr wa rida ilah-in baal samin wa ardin (i.e. with the help and support of that God who is the Owner of the heavens and the earth).
  - In another inscription of the period dated 458 A.D., the word Rahman has been used for the same God, the actual words being bi-rida Rahmanan (i. e. with the help of Rahman.)

## Ayat 21

- `Iblis had no authority over them and whatever happened was in order that We might know him who believes in the Hereafter as distinct from him who is in doubt about it.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Iblis did not have the power to have forcibly misled these people to the way of God’s disobedience although they had wanted to adopt His obedience.
    - Allah had only given him the power that he may seduce and mislead them and make all such people his followers, who may like to follow him of their own accord.
    - And Iblis was provided these opportunities for seduction so that the believers of the Hereafter were distinguished from those who entertained doubts about its coming.
- `Your Lord is watchful over everything.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In other words, this divine statement makes the truth explicit that nothing in this world other than belief in the Hereafter can ensure man’s adherence to the right way. If a man disbelieves that he is to be raised back to life after death and has to render an account of his deeds before his God, he will certainly be misled and go astray, for he will never be able to develop in himself the sense of responsibility which alone can make him adhere to the right way.
    - That is why the artifice of Satan by which he ensnares man is that he makes him heedless of the Hereafter. The one who escapes this satanic enticement can never agree that he should sacrifice the interests of his real everlasting life to the interests of the transient life of the world.
    - On the contrary, the one who disbelieves in the Hereafter under the evil influence of Satan, or at least entertains doubts about it, can never be induced to withdraw from the cash bargain being made in this world only due to the apprehension that it might cause loss in some later life.
    - Whoever has gone astray in the world, has gone astray only due to the denial of the Hereafter, or some suspicion about it; and whoever has adopted righteousness has done so because his righteous deeds have issued from his belief in the Hereafter.
