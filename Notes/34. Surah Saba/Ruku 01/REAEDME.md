**Ayat 01 - 09**

## Ayat 01

- `All praise be to Allah to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Arabic word hamd is used both for praise and for gratitude and both the meanings are implied here. When Allah alone is the Owner of the whole universe and of everything in it, then inevitably He alone deserves to be praised for every beauty, perfection, wisdom, power and excellent skill and design shown and manifested by it. Therefore, every inhabitant of the world must thank Allah alone for any benefit and pleasure that he draws from anything here. For when no one else is a partner in the ownership of these things, no one else deserves to be praised or thanked.
- `and all praise be to Him in the World to Come.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “Just as every blessing in this world is granted by Allah alone, so also in the Hereafter whatever a person will get, he will get from His treasures and by His grace. Therefore, in the Hereafter too, Allah alone deserves to be praised as well as thanked.”
- **`He is Most Wise, All-Aware.`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “All His works are based on perfect wisdom and knowledge. Whatever He does, He does right. He has full knowledge about every creation of His as to where it is, in what state it is, what are its requirements, what precisely needs to be done for its well-being, what it has done so far and what it will do in the future. He is not unaware of the world created by Him, but is fully aware of the condition and state of every particle in it.”


## Ayat 02

- `He knows`
  - `what penetrates into the earth and`
  - `what goes forth from it,`
  - `what descends from the heaven and`
  - `what ascends to it.`
- **`He is the Most Merciful, the Most Forgiving.`**

I think Ar-Rahim is linked with the first part about what peneterates into the earth and what comes out of it as it is a mercy of Allah SWT and I think Al-Ghafur is linked with the second part about what comes down from the sky and what goes up to it as it is a forgiveness of Allah SWT like it could be about our deeds that goes above and Allah SWT forgives us for them..

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “If a person (or persons) is not being seized in spite of rebellion against Him in His Kingdom, it is not because this world is a lawless kingdom, but because Allah is All-Merciful and All-Forbearing. Although it is in His power to seize the sinner and the wrongdoer immediately on the commission of sin, to withhold his sustenance, to paralyze his body, and to put him to death suddenly, yet He does not do it so. It is the demand of His Beneficence that in spite of being All-Powerful, He gives the disobedient servant plenty of time and enough respite to mend his ways and as soon as he desists from his evil ways, He pardons and forgives him.”


## Ayat 03

- `The unbelievers say:`
  - `“How come the Hour is not coming upon us!”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This they said satirically and mockingly. What they meant was: “This Prophet (peace be upon him) has been giving us the news of his coming of Resurrection for along time now, but Resurrection has not overtaken us so far although we have openly denied and rejected him as a Prophet, have been insolent to him and have ridiculed him in every way.
- `Say to them:`
  - `“Yes indeed, by my Lord, by Him Who fully knows the realm beyond the ken of perception, that the Hour shall inevitably come upon you.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The use of the attribute “Knower of the unseen” for Allah while swearing by him by itself points to the fact that the coming of Resurrection is certain, but no one knows except Allah, Knower of the unseen, when exactly it will come. This same theme has been explained at different places in the Quran in various ways.
        - For details, see (Surah Al-Aaraf: Ayat 187), (Surah TaHa: Ayat 15), (Surah Luqman: Ayat 34), (Surah Al-Ahzab: Ayat 63),(Surah Al-Mulk: Ayats 25-26),(Surah An-Naziyat: Ayats 42-44).
  - `Nothing escapes Him, not even the smallest particle in the heavens or the earth;`
  - `nor is anything smaller or bigger than that but is in a Manifest Book.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This is one of the arguments for the possibility of the Hereafter as is being stated in (verse 7) below. One of the reasons why the deniers of the Hereafter regarded the lifeafter- death as irrational was; They said that when all human beings will have become dust after death, and scattered away in particles, how it will be possible to bring all the countless particles together and combine them to be re-created as the same human bodies once again. This doubt has been dispelled, saying, “Every particle wherever it is, is recorded in God’s register, and God knows where a particle is. Therefore, when He wills to recreate, He will not face any difficulty in gathering together all the particles of the body of each and every man.”


## Ayat 04

- `(The Hour shall come) that He may reward those who believe and do righteous deeds. Theirs shall be forgiveness and a generous provision.`


## Ayat 05

- `As for those who worked against Our Signs in order to frustrate them, they shall suffer a painful chastisement.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The above was an argument for the possibility of the Hereafter: this is an argument for its need and necessity.
  - It means: A time must come when the wicked should be requited for their wickedness and the righteous rewarded for their righteousness. Reason wants and justice demands that a worker of goodness should be rewarded and a worker of evil punished.
  - Now when you see that in the present worldly life neither is an evildoer fully requited for his evil nor a worker of goodness for his goodness, rather there are opposite results of evil and goodness in most cases, you should admit that this necessary demand of both reason and justice must be fulfilled at some time in the future.
  - Resurrection and the Hereafter will be the same time. It is not its coming but its not coming which is contrary to reason and against justice.

## Ayat 06

- `(O Prophet), those who have knowledge`
  - `see clearly that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the Truth and`
  - `directs to the Way of the Most Mighty, the Immensely Praiseworthy Lord.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “These antagonists cannot succeed in their object to prove the truth presented by you false, however hard they may try, for they can only delude and misguide the ignorant people by their designs. Those possessed of knowledge cannot be deceived by them.”

## Ayat 07

- `The unbelievers say:`
  - `“Shall we direct you to the man who tells you that when you have been utterly broken to pieces, you will be raised to life again?`

## Ayat 08

 - `Has he forged a lie against Allah, or is he afflicted with madness?”`
   - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
     - The chiefs of the Quraish knew well that it was extremely difficult for the common people to accuse Muhammad (peace be upon him) of being a liar, for the entire nation knew that he was completely a truthful person, and no one had ever heard a lie from him all his life.
     - Therefore, they presented their charge against him before the people like this: “When this person utters an impossible thing like the life-after-death from his mouth, he is either uttering (God forbid) a falsehood deliberately, or he is mad.” But this accusation of madness also was as absurd as of falsehood, for a stupid person only could admit that such a wise and intelligent man as the prophet (peace be upon him) could be mad. That is why Allah did not feel it was necessary to refute their absurd charge by an argument, and only made mention of their wonder which they expressed at the possibility of the life-after-death.
 - `Nay, but those who do not believe in the Hereafter are doomed to be chastised and are far gone in error.`
   - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
     - This is the first answer to their charge. It means: “O foolish people, it is you who have lost your reason. For you do not listen to the one who is informing you of the truth and are recklessly galloping on the way that leads to Hell. But the height of your stupidity is that **you are calling the one who is anxious for your salvation, a mad peron.”**


## Ayat 09

- `Do they not see how the heavens and the earth encompass them from the front and the rear?`
- `We could, if We so wished, cause the earth to swallow them or let fragments of the sky fall upon them.`
- **`Verily there is a Sign in this for every servant (of Allah) who penitently turns to Him.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the second answer to their charge. To understand it well one should bear in mind the fact that three things were most prominent among the reasons for which the disbelieving Quraish denied the life-after-death:
    - (1) They did not want to believe in any kind of accountability before God, for after believing in such a thing they would be left with no freedom whatsoever to behave and act as they pleased in the world.
    - (2) They thought it was inconceivable that Resurrection would take place and the present material order of the universe would be destroyed and replaced by a new order.
    - (3) They thought it was impossible that the people who had died hundreds of thousands of years in the past and whose bones even had decayed and disintegrated, would be raised back to life. With the same body and soul.
  - The answer given above covers all these three aspects, and contains a severe warning as well. The details of the theme contained in these brief sentences are given below:
    - (1) If you ever had observed this earth and the heavens with clear sightedness, you would have seen that it is not a plaything nor has its creation come into being by accident. Everything in this universe points to the fact that it has been created by an All-Powerful Being with great wisdom. In such a wise system it would be highly absurd to think that somebody could be left to live an irresponsible and unaccountable life after he had been given the faculties of intellect and discrimination and authority.
