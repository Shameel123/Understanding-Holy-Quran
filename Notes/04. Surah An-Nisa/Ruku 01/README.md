**Ayat 01 - 10**

## Surah Overview
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - What are the mutual rights of human beings, what are the principles on which a sound and stable family life can be established, are questions that are discussed a little further on in this surah. 
    - As an appropriate introduction to the subject, the surah opens by exhorting the believers to fear God and to avoid courting His displeasure, and by urging them to recognize that all human beings have sprung from the same root and that all of them are, therefore, of one another's flesh and blood.

## Ayat 01


- `O men!`
- `Fear your Lord Who created you from a single being and out of it created its mate;`
- `and out of the two spread many men and women.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The expression 'Who created you from a single being (nafs)' indicates that the creation of the human species began with the creation of one individual. 
    - At another place, the Qur'an specifies that the one person from whom the human race spread in the world was Adam. 
      - (For Adam being the progenitor of mankind see Towards Understanding the Qur'an, (Surah 2, verses 31 f.) and (Surah al-A'raf: 11), etc. - Ed.)
    - **The details how out of that 'being' its mate was created are not known to us.**
      - The explanation which is generally given by the commentators of the Qur'an and which is also found in the Bible is that Eve was, created out of a rib of Adam. (The Talmud is even more detailed in that it states that Eve was created out of Adam's thirteenth rib on the left side.) 
    - The Qur'an, however, is silent on the matter and the tradition which is adduced in support of this statement does not mean what it is often thought to be. 
    - **It is thus better that we leave the matter in the same state of ambiguity in which it was left by God, rather than waste our time trying to determine, in detail, the actual process of the creation of man's mate.'**
      - The author alludes to, but does not quote, the text of the following tradition:Muslim, 'Rida'ah', 61 and 62; Tirmidhi, 'Talaq'' 12; Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 2, pp. 428, 449, 497, 530 and vol. 6, p. 279 - Ed.
- `Fear Allah in Whose name you plead for rights,` 
- `and heed the ties of kinship.` 
- **`Surely, Allah is ever watchful over you.`**


## Ayat 02

- `Give orphans their property,`
- **`and do not exchange the bad for the good,`**
- `and do not eat up their property by mixing it with your own.`
- `This surely is a mighty sin`


## Ayat 03

- `If you fear that you might not treat the orphans justly, then marry the women that seem good to you: two, or three, or four.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Commentators have explained this in the following ways:
      1. There is the view of 'A'ishah who says that men tended to marry orphan girls who were under their guardianship out of consideration for either their property, beauty or because they thought they would be able to treat them according to their whims, as they had no one to protect them. After marriage such men sometimes committed excesses against these girls. It is in this context that the Muslims are told that if they fear they will not be able to do justice to the orphan girls, then they should marry other girls whom they like. (This interpretation seems to be supported by (verse 127 )of this surah.)
      2. The second view is that of Ibn 'Abbas and his disciple 'Ikrimah who expressed the opinion that in the Jahiliyah period there was no limit on the number of wives a man could take. The result was that a man sometimes married as many as ten women and, when expenses increased because of a large family, he encroached on the rights either of his orphan nephews or other relatives. It was in this context that God fixed the limit of four wives and instructed the Muslims that they may marry up to four wives providing they possessed the capacity to treat them equitably.
      3. Sa'id b. Jubayr, Qatadah and some other commentators say that while the Arabs of the Jahiliyah period did not approve of subjecting orphans to wrong, they had no concept of justice and equity with regard to women. They married as many women as they wanted and then subjected them to injustice and oppression. It is in this context that people are told that if they fear perpetrating wrongs on orphans they ought to be equally worried about perpetrating them on women. In the first place they should never marry more than four, and of those four, they should marry only as many as they can treat fairly.
   - Each of the three interpretations is plausible and all three may possibly be correct. Moreover, the verse could also mean that if a person does not find himself able to treat orphans in a fair manner, then he might as well marry the women who are looking after those orphans.
- **`If you fear that you will not be able to treat them justly, then marry (only) one,`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Muslim jurists are agreed that according to this verse the maximum number Of wives has been fixed at four. 
      - This conclusion is also supported by traditions. 
    - It is reported that when Ghaylan, the chief of Ta'if, embraced Islam he had nine wives. The Prophet (peace be on him) ordered him to keep only four wives and divorce the rest. Another person, Nawfal b. Mu'awiyah, had five wives. The Prophet (peace be on him) ordered him to divorce one of them. 
      - (For the relevant traditions see the comments of Ibn Kathir and Qurtubi on this verse - Ed.)
    - **This verse stipulates that marrying more wives than one is permissible on the condition that one treats his wives equitably.** A person who avails himself of this permission granted by God to have a plurality of wives, and disregards the condition laid down by God to treat them equitably has not acted in good faith with God. **In case there are complaints from wives that they are not being treated equitably, the Islamic state has the right to intervene and redress such grievances.** 
    - Some people who have been overwhelmed and overawed by the Christianized outlook of Westerners have tried to prove that the real aim of the Qur'an was to put an end to polygamy (which, in their opinion, is intrinsically evil). Since it was widely practised at that time, however, Islam confined itself to placing restrictions on it. Such arguments only show the mental slavery to which these people have succumbed. That polygamy is an evil per se is an unacceptable proposition, for under certain conditions it becomes a moral and social necessity. If polygamy is totally prohibited men who cannot remain satisfied with only one wife will look outside the bounds of matrimonial life and create sexual anarchy and corruption. This is likely to cause much greater harm than polygamy to the moral and social order. 
      - For this reason the Qur'an has allowed those who feel the need for it to resort to polygamy. Those who consider it an evil in itself may certainly denounce it in disregard of the Qur'an and may even argue for its abolition. But they have no right to attribute such a view to the Qur'an, for it has expressed its permission of polygamy in quite categorical terms. **Indeed, there is not the slightest hint in the Qur'an that could justify the conclusion that it advocates abolition of polygamy.** 
        - (For further elaboration see my book, Sunnat k A'iniHaythiyat, Lahore, 3rd edition, 1975, pp. 307-16.)
- `or marry from among those whom your right hands possess.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This expression denotes 'slave-girls', i.e. female captives of war who are distributed by the state among individuals. 
    - The purpose of this verse is to tell men that if their financial circumstances do not permit them to support a free woman as their wife then they may marry a slave-girl (see verse 25 below); if they consider it necessary to have more than one wife and it would be difficult for them to treat their free wives equitably they may resort to slave-girls, for here the burden of obligations is lighter by comparison. (For further injunctions regarding slave-girls seen. 44 below.)
- **`This will make it more likely that you will avoid injustice.`**


## Ayat 04

- `Give women their bridal-due in good cheer (considering it a duty); `
- `but if they willingly remit any part of it, consume it with good pleasure.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In the opinion of 'Umar and Shurayh, if a woman gives up either the whole or a part of the bridal-due (mahr) in favour of her husband and later reclaims it from him then he is bound to pay it. The claim on the woman's part would be tantamount to her unwillingness to remit either the whole or a part of the bridal-due. For further details see the section entitled 'Mahr' in my book Huquq al-Zawjayn, 16th edition, Lahore, 1976, pp. 31-3 and 119-23



## Ayat 05

This Ayah completely prohibits us for being a fool to entrust our assets to those who has no intelligence for handling it and properly using it.
We can use those assets to help them along the way but cannot entrust the assets to them.

- **`Do not entrust your properties - which Allah hasmade a means of support for you - to the weak of understanding,`**
- `but maintain and clothe them out of it,`
- `and say to them a kind word of admonition.`

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- This verse covers a very wide spectrum of meaning.
- It emphasizes to the community of believers that wealth is one of the main supports of human life.
- It should not be left, therefore, at the mercy of those who are incompetent to handle it properly.
- By misusing wealth such people might destroy the bases of social and economic life and wreck the moral foundations of human society.
- The right to private property is not so absolute; if a person is incapable of exercising this right properly and if he might cause grave social harm by wanton expenditure then his right may be forfeited.
- **The necessities of such a person's life should always be provided for.**
- But so far as the exercise of his proprietary rights is concerned, due restrictions should be placed on it in order that the owner is restrained from spending his resources in brazen disregard of the dictates of morality, collective welfare and economic interests of the community.
- **According to the directive embodied in the verse, anyone who entrusts his property to someone else's care should satisfy himself that the latter is capable of making good use of it.**
- At a higher level, it is incumbent upon an Islamic state to take over the management of the properties of those who either lack totally the capacity for good management or cause social damage by misuse. 
  - In such cases the state is responsible for providing these people with their livelihood.
    - Note: this was new to me..


## Ayat 06

- `Test the orphans until they reach the age of marriage,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - When such people approach their majority their mental development should be watched so as to determine to what extent they have become capable of managing their own affairs.
- `and then if you find them mature of mind hand over to them their property,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Two conditions have been laid down for handing over the charge of their properties to such people. 
      - The first of these is the attainment of puberty, and 
      - the second is that of mental maturity - i.e. the capacity to manage their affairs in a sound and appropriate manner. 
    - **There is full agreement among Muslim jurists with regard to the first condition.**
    - As for the second condition, Abu Hanifah is of the opinion that if an orphan does not attain mental maturity after he has attained puberty, the guardian of the orphan should wait for a maximum of seven years after which he should hand over the property to its owner regardless of whether he has attained maturity or not. According to Abu Yusuf, Muhammad b. al-Hasan and Shafi'i, maturity is an indispensable pre-condition for the handing over of property. If one were to apply the doctrine of the latter jurists it would probably be more appropriate to refer particular cases to a judge under Islamic law. If the judge is convinced that the person concerned lacks maturity he should make adequate arrangements for the supervision of that person's financial affairs. 
      - (For a more complete study of the subject see Jassas, vol. 2, pp. 59 ff.; Ibn Rushd, Biddyat al-Mujtahid, 2 vols., Cairo, Al-Maktabahal-Tijariyahal-Kubra, n.d., vol. 2, pp. 275ff.-Ed.)
- `and do not eat it up by either spending extravagantly or in haste, fearing that they would grow up (and claim it).` 
- `If the guardian of the orphan is rich let him abstain entirely (from his ward's property);`
- `and if he is poor, let him partake of it in a fair measure.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The guardian is entitled to remuneration for his service. The amount of this remuneration should be such as is deemed to be fair by neutral and reasonable people. Moreover, the guardian is instructed that he should take a fixed and known amount by way of remuneration, that he should take it openly rather than secretly, and that he should keep an account of it.
-  `When you hand over their property to them let there be witnesses on their behalf.` 
-  `Allah is sufficient to take account (of your deeds).`


## Ayat 07


- `Just as there is a share for men in what their parents and kinsfolk leave behind,`
- `so there is a share for women in what their parents and kinsfolk leave behind`
  - `- be it little or much - a share ordained (by Allah).`

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- This verse embodies five legal injunctions. 
  - First, that **women as well as men are entitled to inheritance**. 
  - Second, that **inheritance, however meagre it might be, should be distributed; even if the deceased has left a small piece of cloth and he has ten heirs, that piece of cloth should be distributed among them all.** 
    - This does not exclude, however, the permissibility of one heir purchasing the shares of other heirs with their consent. 
  - Third, this verse indicates that **the law of inheritance is applicable to all kinds of property** - movable and immovable, agricultural, industrial and so on. 
  - Fourth, it shows that **the right of inheritance comes into force as soon as a person dies leaving property**. 
  - Fifth, it implies the rule that **immediate blood-relatives exclude those that are further removed**.


## Ayat 08
- `If other near of kin orphans and needy are pre sent at the time of division of inheritance`
- `give them some thing of it and speak to them kindly.`
  
Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This directive is addressed to the heirs of the deceased. They are told not to be niggardly towards their relatives whether they be close or distant. Nor should they be niggardly towards either poor and needy members of the family or towards orphans who are present when the inheritance is distributed. Although they are not legally entitled to any share it is seemly for people to act magnanimously and give them something out of their inheritance, and especially to desist from making hurtful remarks.

## Ayat 09
- `And let them fear,` 
- `those who, if they would themselves leave behind helpless offspring, they would surely have been fearful on their account.`
- `Let them, then, fear Allah and make the right statement.`


## Ayat 10
- `Behold,` 
- **`those who wrongfully devour the properties of orphans only fill their bellies with fire.`**
- ` Soon they will burn in the Blazing Flame.`

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It is reported in a tradition that after the Battle of Uhud the wife of Sa'd b. Rabi' brought her two daughters to the Prophet (peace be on him) and said: 'O Messenger of God! These are daughters of Sa'd who was with you in the Battle of Uhud, where he was martyred. The girls' uncles have seized the whole property and left nothing for them. Who will now marry these girls?' It was after this incident that these verses were revealed. (See Muhammad 'Ali al-Sabuni's comments on this verse in his Safwat al-Tafasir and the sources quoted therein - Ed.)
