**Ayat 71 - 76**

## Ayat 71
- `Believers!`
- `Always be on your guard against encounters.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This discourse was revealed after the Battle of Uhud, when the tribes living around Madina had been greatly encouraged by the defeat of the Muslims. 
  - Thus dangers seemed to surround the Muslims on all sides. Day in and day out news poured in about the hostile intentions of one tribe after another. Reports came in of attacks mounted now in one area, and then in another. The Muslims were again and again the victims of treachery. Their preachers were invited to preach and then put to the sword. Beyond Madina, neither their lives nor their property was secure. Consequently the Muslims had to prepare themselves for a fierce struggle, for a tremendous, all-out effort to ensure that the Islamic movement would not be crushed.

- `Then (as circumstance demands) either advance in detachments or advance in a body.`


## Ayat 72
- `Among you there is such who lags behind,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Another meaning could be that such persons not only shirk the risks of fighting themselves but also go about spreading demoralization to discourage others from fighting in the name of God
- `then if some affliction strikes you, he says:`
  - `'Indeed Allah bestowed His favour upon me that I was not present with them.'`


## Ayat 73
- `And if a bounty from Allah is given you, he says - `
- `and says as if there never was any affection between you and him - `
  - `Oh, would that I had been with them, I would have come by a great gain.`

## Ayat 74
- `Let those who seek the life of the Next World in exchange for the life of this world fight in the way of Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The point stressed here is that fighting in the cause of God cannot be conducted by people engrossed in the pursuit of worldly benefits. 
    - This is the task of those who seek to please God, who have complete faith in Him and in the Hereafter, who are prepared to sacrifice all opportunities of worldly success and prosperity, and of all worldly interests, hoping thereby to win God's good pleasure. 
    - Irrespective of what happens in the present world such sacrifices will not be wasted in the Hereafter. Jihad (struggle in the cause of God) is not for those who mainly care for worldly benefits.
- **`We shall grant a mighty reward to whoever fights in the way of Allah, whether he is slain or comes out victorious.`**


## Ayat 75
- `How is it that you do not fight in the way of Allah and in support of the helpless - men, women and children -who pray:`
  - `'Our Lord, bring us out of this land whose people are oppressors and appoint for us from Yourself, a protector, and appoint for us from Yourself a helper'?.`


## Ayat 76
- `Those who have faith fight in the way of Allah, while those who disbelieve fight in the way of taghut (Satan).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This lays down a clear verdict of God. To fight in the cause of God in order that His religion be established on earth is the task of men of faith, and whoever truly believes can never shirk this duty. To fight in the cause of taghut (authority in defiance of God) in order that the world may be governed by rebels against God is the task of unbelievers in which no believer can engage himself.
- `Fight, then, against the fellows of Satan. Surely Satan's strategy is weak.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Satan and his comrades-in-arms ostensibly undertake tremendous preparations and contrive all kinds of ingenious machinations. True men of faith, however, should not be intimidated either by such preparations or by machinations. For, no matter what they do, they are doomed to fail.
