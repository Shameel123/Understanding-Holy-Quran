**Ayat 60 - 70**


## Ayat 60


- `(O Messenger!)`
- `Have you not seen those who claim to believe in the Book which has been revealed to you and in the Books revealed before you, and`
- **`yet desire to submit their disputes to the judgement of taghut (the Satanic authorities who decide independently of the Law of Allah),`**
- `whereas they had been asked to reject it.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **Taghut clearly signifies here a sovereign who judges things according to criteria other than the law of God.**
    - It also stands for a legal and judicial system which acknowledges neither the sovereignty of God nor the paramount authority of the Book of God. 
    - This verse categorically proclaims that to refer disputes to the judgement of a court of law which is essentially taghut contravenes the dictates of a believer's faith. In fact, true faith in God and His Book necessarily requires that a man should refuse to recognize the legitimacy of such courts. 
    - According to the Qur'an, belief in God necessitates repudiation of the authority of taghut. 
    - **To try to submit both to God and to taghut at the same time is hypocrisy.**
- `And Satan seeks to make them drift far away from the right way.`

## Ayat 61
- `When they are told:`
  - **`'Come to that which Allah has revealed, and come to the Messenger',`**
- `you will notice the hypocrites turning away from you in aversion.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This shows that the hypocrites were inclined to refer to the Prophet (peace be on him) those cases in which they expected a favourable decision. 
      - When they feared an adverse judgement they refused to refer to the Prophet (peace be on him). 
    - This continues to be the practice of many hypocrites even now. Whenever they feel that Islamic Law would further their interests they turn to it but when they feel it would militate against them they refer their disputes to whichever legal systems and courts of law, customs and usages they anticipate most likely to give them a favourable decision.
  - I think, according to this, in this age, we all are hypocrites.


## Ayat 62
- `But what happens when some misfortune visits them because of their own misdeeds?`
- `Then, they come to you swearing by Allah, saying:`
  - `'We wanted nothing but to do good and to bring about conciliation (between the two parties)'.`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This may mean that when Muslims become aware of their hypocritical activities and they feel afraid of being caught, censured, and eventually punished, the hypocrites resort to every stratagem, including oaths, in order to assure people that they are true believers.


## Ayat 63
- **`As for them, Allah knows what is in their hearts.`**
- `Leave them alone,`
- `admonish them,`
- `and say to them penetrating words about themselves.`
- Personal Note: I think, Allah here guides us to leave such people alone and still try to bring them over the right path!

## Ayat 64
- `(And tell them that) We never sent a Messenger but that he should be obeyed by the leave of Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is to impress upon us that Prophets are not sent so that people may pay lip-service to their Prophethood, and then obey whoever they wish.
    - The purpose of sending Prophets is that people should follow the laws of God as brought and expounded by them rather than laws devised by man, and that they should obey the commands of God as revealed to the Prophets to the exclusion of the commands of others.
- **`If whenever they wronged themselves they had come to you praying to Allah for forgiveness, and had the Messenger prayed for their forgiveness, they would indeed have found Allah All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate.`**


## Ayat 65
- **`But no, by your Lord, they cannot become true be-lievers until they seek your arbitration in all matters on which they disagree among themselves,`**
- **`and then find not the least vexation in their hearts over what you have decided,`**
- **`and accept it in willing submission.`**

## Ayat 66
- `Had We enjoined upon them: 'Slay yourselves', or 'Leave your habitations', very few of them would have done it;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - As these people are not prepared to endure even minor losses and inconveniences in order to follow the law of God, they can never be expected to make big sacrifices. 
    - If asked either to lay down their lives or to give up their homes and families for the sake of the Truth they would fly straight back to unbelief and disobedience.
- `yet if they had done as they were admonished, it would have been better for them and would have strengthened them;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Had these people been able to free themselves of uncertainty, hesitation and ambivalence, and to resolve firmly to follow and obey the Prophet (peace be on him), their lives would have been spared the instability from which they suffer. 
    - Their way of thinking, their morals and their practical dealings would all have found permanent and stable foundations, and they would have enjoyed the blessings granted only to those who follow the one straight path with firmness and resolution. 
    - **For one who is subject to indecision and hesitation, who keeps changing from one direction to another in a state of uncertainty, life is a continuous exercise in futility.**


## Ayat 67
- **`whereupon We would indeed grant them from Us a mighty reward,`**

## Ayat 68
- `and guide them to a straight way.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - By giving up uncertainty, and deciding with complete faith and conviction to follow the Prophet (peace be on him), the straight path of their endeavours would have opened up before them. 
    - They would have been able to perceive clearly the channels into which their energies should be directed, so that each step they took would be a step towards the true goal.

## Ayat 69
- `And he who obeys Allah and the Messenger`
- `-they shall be with those whom Allah has favoured` -
  1. `the Prophets,`
  2. `those steadfast in truthfulness,`
  3. `the martyrs,`
  4. `and the righteous."`
- **`How excellent will they be for companions!`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - He who enjoys, in this world, the company of the kind of people mentioned in this verse, and whom God judges worthy of the same company in the Hereafter is fortunate. The fact is that unless a man's natural sensitivity has atrophied, the companionship of corrupt and wicked people is a painful punishment even in this transient world, let alone that one should be subjected to the perpetual companionship of such people in the abiding life of the Hereafter. 
    - Good people have always longed for the company of like people, both in this world and the Next.
  

## Ayat 70
- `That is a bounty from Allah, and`
- `Allah suffices to know the truth.`
