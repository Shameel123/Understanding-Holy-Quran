**Ayat 51 - 67**

## Ayat 51

- `Then the Trumpet shall be blown and lo! they will come out of their graves and be on the move towards their Lord,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For the explanation of the blowing of the Trumpet, see (E.N. 78 of Surah TaHa). As for the length of the interval between the first blowing of the Trumpet and its second blowing, we have no information. The interval may be of hundreds and thousands of years. Abu Hurairah has related that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Israfil has put the Trumpet to his mouth and is looking up to the divine Throne, awaiting orders for blowing it. The Trumpet will be blown thrice.

## Ayat 52

- `(nervously) exclaiming.`
  - `“Alas for us! Who roused us out of our sleeping-place?”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, at that time they will not realize that they had been dead and had been raised back to life after a long period, but they will be thinking that they had fallen asleep, and had been woken up suddenly by some terrible catastrophe, and were running away from it. (For further details, see Surahs (TaHa, Ayat 103);(Al-Hajj, Ayats 1-2).)
  - `“This is what the Merciful One had promised, and what (His) Messengers had said was true.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Here, it is not clear as to who will give this answer. It may be that they themselves would realize after some time to their horror that it was the same thing of which the Messengers of God used to inform them and they used to belie them. It may also be that the believers will remove their misunderstanding and tell them that it was not waking up from sleep but the second life after death. And it may also be that they will understand this from the general conditions prevailing on the Day of Resurrection and the angels might tell them this.

## Ayat 53

- `Then there will simply be one single Blast, and all will have gathered before Us.`

## Ayat 54

- `Today no one shall suffer the least injustice, and you shall not be recompensed except according to your deeds.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is what Allah will tell the disbelievers and the polytheists, the sinners and the culprits, when they will be presented before Him.

## Ayat 55

- `Indeed, the people of Paradise will be busy enjoying themselves:`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - To understand this one should remember that the righteous believers will not be withheld in the Plain of Resurrection, but in the very beginning they will be sent to Paradise without accountability, or after a mild reckoning, because their record will be clean. There will be no need to keep them waiting during the hearing by the Court. Therefore, Allah will tell the culprits, who will be required to render their accounts, in the Plain of Resurrection: Look! the righteous people whom you used to mock and regard as foolish in the world, are today enjoying the pleasures of Paradise because of their wisdom, and you, who in your own judgment were very prudent and sagacious, are being condemned to accountability for your misdeeds.

## Ayat 56

- `they and their spouses shall be reclining on their couches in shady groves;`

## Ayat 57

- `therein there will be all kinds of fruits to eat, and they shall have all that they desire.`

## Ayat 58

- `“Peace” shall be the word conveyed to them from their Merciful Lord.`

## Ayat 59

- `“Criminals, separate yourselves from others today!`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This can have two meanings:

## Ayat 60

- `Children of Adam, did I not command you not to serve Satan �`
- `he is to you an open enemy`

## Ayat 61

- `and serve Me alone: this is the Straight Way?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here again Allah has used ibadat (worship) in the sense of itaat (obedience). This subject has already been explained above in (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 172); (Surah An- Nisa, Ayat 117), (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayats 121, 137),(Surah At- Taubah, Ayat 31); (Surah Ibrahim, Ayat 22); (Surah Al-Kahf, Ayat 52); (Surah Maryam, Ayat 42), (Surah Al-Qasas, Ayat 63) and (E.N. 63 of Surah Saba).
  - In this connection, the fine explanation given of it by Imam Razi in his Tafsir Kabir is also noteworthy. He writes: Do not worship Satan means: Do not obey him, the reason being that only falling prostrate before him is not forbidden, but following him and obeying his commands also is forbidden; therefore, **itaat (obedience) is ibadat (worship)**. After this, the Imam raises the question: If ibadat means itaat, then have the Muslims been commanded to worship the Prophet and the rulers in the verse: Atiullaha wa ati-ur-rasula wa ulil-amri min-kum? He himself answers it thus: **If obedience to them is in accordance with the commands of Allah, it will be Allah’s worship (ibadat) and His obedience (itaat).** Did not the angels fall prostrate before Adam in obedience to Allah’s command? This was nothing but worship of Allah. Obedience of the rulers will be their worship only in cases where they are obeyed in matters in which Allah has not given leave to obey them. Then he writes: If a person comes to you and commands you to do something, you should see whether his command is in accordance with the command of Allah or not. If it is not, Satan is with him; and if you obeyed him in this, you worshiped him and his Satan. Likewise, if your self urges you to do something, you should see whether it is permissible to do it according to the Sahariah or not. If it is not permissible, your self is Satan itself, or Satan is with it. If you obeyed him, you in fact became guilty of worshiping him.
  - Further on, he writes: But there are different degrees of the worship of Satan. Sometimes it so happens that a man does a work and his limbs and his tongue also join him in this, and his heart also cooperates. At another time it so happens that a man uses his limbs to do a work but his heart and tongue do not cooperate in this. Some people commit a sin while their heart is disagreeable and their tongue is invoking Allah for forgiveness, and they confess that they are committing an evil. This is Satan’s worship with external limbs. There are other people who commit a crime with a cool mind and express pleasure and satisfaction with the tongue also. Such people are the worshipers of Satan from outside as well as from inside. (Tafsir Kabir, vol. VII, pp. 103-104).

## Ayat 62 

- `Still, he misguided a whole throng of you. Did you have no sense?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, If you had been deprived of reason and you had served your enemy instead of your Lord, you could have the reason to offer an excuse. But you, in fact, had been blessed with reason by Allah and you were using it to advantage in all the affairs of the world, and you had been warned by Allah through the Prophets as well, yet, when you were deceived by your enemy and he succeeded in leading you astray, you could not be excused from the responsibility of your folly.

## Ayat 63

- `Now this is the Hell of which you were warned.`

## Ayat 64

- `Burn in it on account of your disbelieving.`

## Ayat 65

- `Today We shall put a seal on their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us and their feet shall bear witness to what they had been doing.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This command will be given in respect of the stubborn culprits, who will refuse to confess their crimes, will belie the witnesses, and will also not acknowledge the genuineness of their conduct-book. Then will Allah Almighty command: Well, stop your babbling. Just see what your own limbs say about your misdeeds. In this connection, here only the evidence to be given by the hands and the feet has been mentioned. But at other places it has been said that their eyes and their ears and their tongues, and the very skins of their body, will tell how they had been employed in the world.
  - **They should not forget the Day when their own tongues and their own hands and feet will bear testimony to their misdeeds.** (Surah An-Noor, Ayat 24)
  - **Then, when all will have reached there, their ears and their eyes and their very skins will bear witness against them concerning what they had been doing in the world.** (Surah HaMim-Sajdah, Ayat 20)
  - The question arises: On the one hand, Allah says: We shall seal their mouths, and on the other hand, in the verse of Surah An-Noor, He says: Their tongues will bear testimony against them. How can these two things be reconciled?
  - The answer is: To seal the mouths means to deprive them of their power of speech. That is, after this they will not be able to say whatever they like with their tongue. The testimony of their tongues means that their tongues themselves will tell how the wicked people had used them, what blasphemies and lies they had been made to utter, what mischief they had invented and what falsehoods they had been made to say on different occasions.

## Ayat 66

- `If We so willed, We would have put out their eyes, then they would rush to see the Way, but how would they be able to see?`

## Ayat 67

- `If We so willed, We would have transformed them where they were so that they would not go forward or backward.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - After depicting the scene of Resurrection, the people are being warned to this effect: The Resurrection may seem yet far off to you, but even if you consider seriously your life in this world of which you are so proud, you will see how helpless you are in the powerful grip of Allah. Your eyes by virtue of whose sight you are carrying out all your obligations in the world can be blinded at one command of Allah. Your legs on whose strength you are showing all this activity can become paralyzed as and when Allah wills. As long as the powers and capabilities granted by Allah continue to function, you remain lost in the arrogance of your self, but as soon as one of them fails to function, you come to understand how helpless you are.
