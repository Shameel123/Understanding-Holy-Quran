**Ayat 68 - 83**

## Ayat 68

- `Whomsoever We grant a long life, We reverse him in his constitution.`
- `Do they still not understand?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Reverse him in creation,” means that in old age Allah turns him back to the state of childhood. He becomes unable to stand and walk without the help and support of others; he is fed by others; he urinates and defecates in bed; talks childishly and is laughed at by others. In short, towards the end of life he returns to the same state of weakness with which he had started life in this world.

## Ayat 69

- `We did not teach him (to wit, the Messenger) poetry and it does not behove him.`
- `This is none but an Admonition, and a Clear Book`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is a rejoinder to the disbelievers, who slighted the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his message by branding him a poet when he preached Tauhid and talked of the Hereafter, life-after-death, and Hell and Heaven. (For further explanation, see(Surah Ash-Shuara, Ayats 224-227) and the E.Ns thereof).

## Ayat 70

- `that he may warn him who is alive and establish an argument against those that deny the Truth.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Every living person means: Every person who is capable of thinking and understanding, who is not like a stone, which neither hears nor understands nor moves from its place however rationally and sympathetically one may explain the distinction between the truth and falsehood and give admonition before him.

## Ayat 71

- `Do they not see Our handiwork:`
- `We created for them cattle which they own?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The word “hands” has been used metaphorically for Allah. This does not mean that, God forbid, Allah has a body and He works with the hands like human beings, but it means to impress that Allah has made these things Himself, and none else has any share in the matter of their creation.

## Ayat 72

- `We have subjected the cattle to them so that some of them they ride and eat the flesh of others.`

## Ayat 73

- `They derive a variety of benefits and drinks from them.`
- `Will they, then, not give thanks?`

## Ayat 74

- `They set up deities apart from Allah, hoping that they will receive help from them.`

## Ayat 75

- `Those deities can render them no help.`
- `Yet these devotees act as though they were an army in waiting for them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the poor false gods themselves are dependent upon their worshipers for their survival and their safety and their needs. But for their multitudes they could not survive as gods even for a day. These people are behaving as their humble servants. They are setting up and decorating their shrines; they carry out propaganda for them; they fight and quarrel with others for their sake. Then only are they recognized as gods. They are not the real God, Who, whether someone recognizes Him or not, is ruling over the whole universe by His own might and authority.


## Ayat 76

- `Let not their words grieve you.`
- `Surely We know all things about them, what they conceal and what they reveal.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The address is to the Prophet (peace be upon him). Here the allusion is to the campaign of vilification which the chiefs of the disbelievers of Makkah were carrying on against him. They knew in their hearts and acknowledged in their private assemblies that the charges they brought against him were absolutely baseless. In order to create suspicions against him in the minds of the people, they branded him a poet, sorcerer, magician, madman, etc. But their consciences recognized, and they also acknowledged before one another, that whatever they were uttering was false, which they were forging only to frustrate his mission. That is why Allah says to His Prophet: Do not grieve at their absurd and meaningless talk. Those who are opposing and resisting the truth with falsehood shall ultimately meet with failure in this world and see their evil end in the Hereafter, too.


## Ayat 77

- Tafhim-ul-Quran:
  - Here the disbelievers’ question cited in (verse 48) above, is being answered by reason and argument. The question: When will the threat of Resurrection be carried out? had not been asked with a view to find out the exact date of the coming of the Hereafter. But they asked it because they thought it was impossible, rather irrational, that human beings would be raised back to life after death. That is why, in reply to their question, arguments are being given for the possibility of the Hereafter.
  - According to the traditions related by Ibn Abbas, Qatadah and Said bin Jubair, one of the chiefs of Makkah, on this occasion, came up with a rotten bone of a dead person, from the graveyard. He broke and crushed it into pieces before the Prophet (peace be upon him) and scattering its particles in the air, said: O Muhammad, you say that the dead will be raised back to life. **Tell us who will give life to these decayed and rotten bones?** The answer was given immediately in the form of these verses.

- `Does man not see that We created him of a sperm drop,`
- `and lo! he is flagrantly contentious?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, We caused the sperm-drop which contained nothing but the basic germ of life to develop to an extent that it started moving and eating like the animals. Furthermore, it has developed such powers of intellect and reasoning and disputation and speech, which are not possessed by any animal; so much so that now he dares stand up as an adversary before his Creator!

## Ayat 78

- `He strikes for Us a similitude`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, he regards Us powerless and weak like the creation, and thinks that just as man cannot raise the dead back to life, so also can’t We.
- `and forgot his own creation.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Forgets his own creation”: Forgets that We created the basic germ of life from dead matter, which became the means of his creation; then We caused the germ to develop to such an extent that now he stands before Us as a disputant.
- `He says:`
  - `“Who will quicken the bones when they have decayed?”`

## Ayat 79

- `Say:`
  - `“He Who first brought them into being will quicken them; He knows well about every kind of creation;`

## Ayat 80

- `He Who created from a green tree a fire for you, a fire to light your stoves with.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It either means that He has placed the inflammable matter in the green trees due to which people kindle fire from the pieces of wood. Or, it is an allusion to the markh and afar trees, whose green branches the Arabs struck against each other to produce the sparks. In ancient times the Bedouins used this method of kindling the fire and might even be using the same today.

## Ayat 81


- `Has He Who created the heavens and the earth no power to create the likes of them?`
- **`Yes, indeed, He is the Superb Creator.`**

## Ayat 82

- **`Whenever He wills a thing, He just commands it “Be” and it is.`**

## Ayat 83

- **`Holy is He Who has full control over everything, and to Him you shall all be recalled.`**
