**Ayat 19 - 25**

## Ayat 19

- `Imagine the Day when Allah's enemies will be mustered to the Fire,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - What is meant to be said hare is: When they will be rounded up to be presented in the Court of Allah, though the words used are to the effect: When they will be gathered to be driven to Fire of Hell, for Hell in any case will be their final destination.
- `and the people of the former times will be detained until the arrival of people of the later times,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, All the former and latter generations and races will be gathered together at a time and called to account together. For, whatever a person does in his lifetime, whether good or evil, its influence and impact does not end with his life but continues to operate even after his death for long periods of time, for which he is totally responsible. Likewise, whatever a generation does in its own time, its influence continues to affect the later generations for centuries, and it is responsible for its heritage. It is inevitable to examine all these influences and their results and to collect their evidences.
    - For that very reason, generation after generation of the people will go on arriving and will be withheld. The court will start its work when all the former and latter generations will have assembled together in the Plain of Resurrection.
    - (For further explanation, see( Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayats 38-39 and E.N. 30) on it.)

## Ayat 20

- `and when all have arrived, their ears, their eyes, and their skins shall bear witness against them, stating all that they had done in the life of the world.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The explanation of this given in the Hadith is that when a stubborn culprit will go on denying his crimes, and will even belie all the witnesses, then the limbs of his body will bear the witness, one after the other, by the command of Allah, and will tell what offenses he had committed through them.
  - This thing has been reported by Anas, Abu Musa Ashari, Abu Said Khudri and Ibn Abbas from the Prophet (peace be upon him), and traditionists like Muslim, Nasai, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim, Bazzar and others have related these in their books. (For further explanation, see(E.N. 55 of Surah YaSeen).)

## Ayat 21

- `They will ask their skins:`
  - `“Why did you bear witness against us?”`
- `The skins will reply:`
  - `“Allah gave us speech, as He gave speech to all others. He it is Who created you for the first time and it is to Him that you will be sent back.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This shows that not only man’s own limbs will bear witness on the Day of Resurrection, but every such thing before which man would have committed any crime will also speak out. The same thing has been said in Surah Al- Zilzal, thus: **The earth will cast out all the burdens, which lie within it, and man will say: what has befallen it? On that Day shall it relate whatever had happened (on it), because your Lord will have commanded it (to do so).** (verses 2-5).

## Ayat 22

- `When you used to conceal yourselves (while committing misdeeds) you never thought that your ears or your eyes or your skins would ever bear witness against you;`
- `you rather fancied that Allah does not know a great deal of what you do.`

## Ayat 23

- `This thought of yours about your Lord has led to your perdition and you have become among the losers.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Hasan Basri has explained this verse thus: **Every man’s attitude and conduct is determined by the thought and conjecture that he has about his God.** The conduct of a righteous believer is right because his thought and conjecture about his Lord is right, and the conduct of a disbeliever and a hypocrite and a sinful person is wrong because his thought and conjecture about his Lord is wrong.
  - This same theme has the Prophet (peace be upon him) expressed in a comprehensive and brief Hadith, thus: **Your Lord says: I am with the thought and conjecture that My servant holds about Me.** (Bukhari, Muslim).

## Ayat 24

- `In this state, whether they bear with patience (or not),`
- `Fire alone shall be their abode.`
- `And if they seek to make amends, they will not be allowed to do so.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It can also mean this: If they would want to return to the world, they would not be able to return, and this: If they would want to come out from Hell, they would not be able to come out of it, and this: If they would want to offer an excuse or repentance, it would not be accepted.

## Ayat 25

- `We had assigned to them companions who embellished for them all that was before them and behind them.`
- `Thus the same decree (of chastisement) which had overtaken the previous generations of jinn and human beings (also) became due against them.`
- `Surely they became the losers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the permanent and eternal way of Allah that He dots not let the men with evil intentions and desires have good companions, but lets them have bad companions according to their own inclinations. 
  - Then, as they go on descending into the depths of vice, more and more evil and wicked men and devils go on joining them as their associates and advisers and companions. Some people’s saying that so-and-so is himself a very good man but happens to have bad companions is, in fact, contrary to fact.
  - The law of nature is that every man gets the same sort of friends as he himself is. If bad people happen to be associated with a good man, they cannot remain associated with him for long. Likewise, if good and noble men happen to be associated with evil intentioned and immoral men by chance, their association cannot last long. An evil man naturally attracts only evil men to himself and only evil men become attracted towards him just as filth attracts flits and flits are attracted by the filth.
