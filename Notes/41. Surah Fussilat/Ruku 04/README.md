**Ayat 26 - 32**

## Ayat 26

- `The deniers of the Truth say:`
  - `“Do not give ear to the Qur'an and cause interruption when it is recited; thus perhaps you will gain the upper hand.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This was one of those plans of the disbelievers of Makkah with which they wanted to frustrate the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) mission of preaching his message. They knew well haw impressive was the Quran, how high was the character of the man presenting it, and how effective and inspiring the style of his preaching. They knew that anyone who heard such matchless discourses in such an attractive style from such a noble person could not help being hued and charmed. Therefore, they planned that they should neither hear it themselves nor let anyone else hear it; whenever Muhammad (peace be upon him) should start reciting it, they should create noise, clap hands, pass taunting remarks and raise all sorts of objections and such a hue and cry as to subdue his voice. By this plan they hoped they would be able to defeat the Prophet of Allah.

## Ayat 27

- `We shall certainly make these unbelievers taste a terrible chastisement and shall fully requite them according to the worst deeds that they committed.`

## Ayat 28

- `That is the recompense of the enemies of Allah the Fire, their abiding home.`
- `That will be the re-compense for their denying Our Signs.`

## Ayat 29

- `There the unbelievers will say:`
  - `“Our Lord, show us those that led us astray, both jinn and humans, and we will trample them under our feet so that they are utterly degraded.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, in the world these people were at the beck and call of their leaders and religious guides and deceitful devils, but when on the Day of Resurrection they will come to know where their leaders had led them, they will curse them and would wish that they should somehow get hold of them so that they may trample them under their foot.

## Ayat 30

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - After warning the disbelievers of the consequences of their opposition to the truth and their stubbornness, the address now turns to the believers and the Prophet (peace be upon him).

- `Those who say`
  - `“Allah is our Lord”`
- `and then remain steadfast,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they did not call Allah their Lord merely incidentally, nor were they involved in the error to regard Allah as their Lord and at the same time others as well as their lords, but they embraced the faith sincerely and stood by it steadfastly: neither adopted a creed contrary to it later nor mixed it up with a false creed, but they fulfilled the demands of the doctrine of Tauhid in their practical lives as well.
    - “Then remain upright” has been explained by the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the eminent companions thus:
      - Anas has reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: **Many people called Allah their Lord, but most of them became disbelievers. Firm and steadfast is he who remained firm on this creed till his death.** (Ibn Jarir, Nasai, Ibn Abi Hatim).
- `upon them descend angels`
- `(and say):`
  - `“Do not fear nor grieve,`
  - `and receive good tidings of Paradise which you were promised.`

## Ayat 31

- `We are your companions in this world and in the Hereafter.`
- `There you shall have all that you desire and all what you will ask for.`

## Ayat 32

- **`This is by way of hospitality from Him Who is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.”`**
