**Ayat 09 - 18**

## Ayat 09

- `Tell them, (O Prophet):`
  - `“Do you indeed disbelieve in Him and assign compeers to Him Who created the earth in two days?`
  - `He is the Lord of all beings of the Universe.`

## Ayat 10

- `(After creating the earth)`
- `He set up firm mountains on it,`
- `blessed it,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Blessings of the earth imply those measureless and countless things which have been continuously coming out of it since millions and millions of years, and are fulfilling the ever increasing needs and requirements of all the creatures from the microscopic germs to the highly civilized man. Among these the principal blessings are the air and the water by which alone vegetable, animal and then human life became possible on the earth.
- `and provided it with sustenance in proportion to the needs of all who seek (sustenance).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This sentence has been interpreted by the commentators in different ways:
      - Some of them interpret it to mean: The provisions of the earth were placed in it precisely according to the needs and requirements of those who ask, in exactly four days. That is, it took exactly four days, neither more nor less.
- `All this was done in four days.`

## Ayat 11

- `Then He turned to the heaven while it was all smoke.`
- `He said to the heaven and the earth:`
  - `“Come (into being), willingly or unwillingly.”`
- `They said:`
  - `“Here we come (into being) in willing obeisance.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Three things need to be explained here:
    - First, by heaven is meant the whole universe, as becomes obvious from the following sentences. In other words, turning to the heaven means that Allah turned to the creation of the universe.

## Ayat 12

- `Then He made them seven heavens in two days and revealed to each heaven its law.`
- `And We adorned the lower heaven with lamps, and firmly secured it.`
- `All this is the firm plan of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - To understand these verses well, it would be useful to study the following portions of the Tafheem al-Quran: (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 29);(Surah Ar-Raad, Ayat 2); (Surah Al-Hijr, Ayats 16-18); (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 30-33);(Surah Al-Hajj, Ayat 65); (Surah Al-Muminun, Ayat 17); (Surah YaSeen: E.N. 37), and (E.Ns 5-9 of Surah As-Saaffat)." 1

## Ayat 13

- `But if they turn away, tell them:`
  - `“I warn you against a sudden scourge like that which struck Ad and Thamud.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, if they do not believe that God and Deity is One and only One, Who has created this earth and the whole universe, and if they still persist in their ignorance that they would make others as their deities beside Him, others who are in fact His creatures and slaves, and regard them as His associates in His Being and rights and powers, then warning for them is like that of what stuck Aad and Thamud.

## Ayat 14

- `When the Messengers (of Allah) came to them from the front and from the rear, saying:`
  - `“Do not serve any but Allah”;`
- `they said:`
  - `“Had our Lord so willed, He would have sent down angels. So we deny the Message you have brought.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This sentence can have several meanings:
    - (1) That the Messengers continued to come to them one after the other.

## Ayat 15

- `As for Ad, they waxed proud in the land without justification and said:`
  - `“Who is greater than we in strength?”`
- `Did they not see that Allah, Who created them, is greater in strength than they?`
- `They continued to deny Our Signs,`

## Ayat 16

- `whereupon We sent upon them a fierce wind on inauspicious days`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Evil days” does not mean that the days in themselves were evil or ill-omened, and the torrent came because the people of Aad met with those evil or ill-omened days. If this were the meaning and there were some ill omen in the days themselves, the torment would have visited all the nations of the world.
    - The correct meaning, therefore, is that since in those days God’s torment descended on this nation, the days were evil or ill-omened for the people of Aad.
    - **It is not correct to argue on the basis of the verse that some days are ill-omened and some auspicious.**
- `that We might make them taste a degrading chastisement in the life of this world.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The lexicographers have disputed the meaning of the words rih-an sarsaran, which have been used for the stormy wind. Some say that they imply an intensely hot wind, others say that they imply an extremely cold wind, and some others say that they imply a wind which produces a great noise when it blows.
    - In any case, they all agree that the words are used for a severe storm.
- `And surely the chastisement of the Hereafter is even more degrading.`
- `There will be none to help them there.`

## Ayat 17

- `As for Thamud, We bestowed guidance upon them, but they preferred to remain blind rather than be guided.`
- `At last a humiliating scourge overtook them on account of their misdeeds.`

## Ayat 18

- `Yet We delivered those who believed and were God-fearing.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For the details of the story of Thamud see (Surah Al- Aaraf, Ayats 73-79); (Surah Houd, Ayats 61-68);(Surah Al- Hijr, Ayats 80-84);(Surah Bani-Israil, Ayat 59);(Surah AshShuaara, Ayats 141-159);(Surah An-Naml, Ayats 45-53) and the E.Ns.
