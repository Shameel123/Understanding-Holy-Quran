**Ayat 45 - 54**

## Ayat 45

- `And in the past We gave Moses the Book and yet it became an object of dispute.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, some people had believed in it and some others had made up their minds to oppose it.
- `If your Lord's decree had not gone forth before, a decisive judgement would have been made among them, once and for all.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It has two meanings:
      - (1) If Allah had not already decreed that the people would be given enough respite for consideration the disputants would have long been destroyed.
- `Surely they are in a disquieting doubt about it.`

## Ayat 46

- `Whoever does good, does so to his own benefit;`
- `and whoever does evil, will suffer its evil consequence.`
- `Your Lord does no wrong to His servants.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, your Lord can never be so unjust as to let go to waste the good deeds of a good man and fail to punish the evil-doers for their evil.

## Ayat 47

- `The knowledge of the Hour rests solely with Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Hour: the Hour of Resurrection, i.e. the Hour when the evildoers will be punished for their evil and the grievances of the oppressed good people will be redressed.
    - By this the listeners have been made to realize two things: 
      - (1) That not only of Resurrection but the knowledge of all unseen things is reserved for Allah alone; there is no other knower of the unseen.
      - (2) That God Who possesses the detailed knowledge of the most minor things cannot remain unaware of the acts and deeds of anybody.
- `Not a fruit comes forth from its sheath,`
- `nor does any female conceive nor give birth to a child but it is in His knowledge.`
- `On that Day He will call out to them:`
  - `“Where are those associates of Mine?”`
- `They will answer:`
  - `“We have declared to You that none of us can bear witness to that.”`

## Ayat 48

- `Then all those deities whom they once used to call upon shall vanish`
- `and they will come to know for sure that there is no escape for them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, in their utter hopelessness they will look around to see if they could find any one of those whom they used to serve and worship in the world, who could come to their rescue and save them from God’s torment, or at least have their punishment reduced, but they will find no helper on any side.

## Ayat 49

- `Man wearies not of praying for good,`
- `but when evil visits him, he despairs and gives up all hope.`

## Ayat 50

- `And if We bestow Our Mercy upon him after hardship, he will surely say:`
  - `“This is what I truly deserve,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, I have gotten all this because of my being worthy of it. It is my right that I should receive all this.
  - `and I do not believe that the Hour (of Resurrection) will ever come to pass;`
  - `and if I am returned to my Lord, there too I shall enjoy the best.”`
- `Surely We shall fully apprise the unbelievers of what they have done, and We shall certainly make them taste a severe chastisement.`

## Ayat 51

- `When We bestow Our favour upon man, he turns away and waxes proud;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, he turns away from Our obedience and worship, and thinks it is below his dignity to bow to Us.
- `but when a misfortune touches him, he is full of supplication.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - For other verses on this subject, see(Surah Younus, Ayat 12); (Surah Bani Israil, Ayat 83); (Surah ArRoom, Ayat 33-36); (Surah Az-Zumar, Ayats 8-9, 49 )and the E.Ns.

## Ayat 52

- `Tell them, (O Prophet):`
  - `“Did you ever consider: if this Qur'an is indeed from Allah and you still deny it, who can be in greater error than he who goes far in fiercely opposing it?”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It does not mean that they should believe in it only owing to the danger that if it were really from Allah they would be inviting their own doom by denying it.
  - But it means this: It is not wisdom that you should be bent upon opposing it stubbornly without seriously trying to understand what it says. You cannot assert that you have come to know that this Quran is not from God, and you have known with certainty that God has not sent it. Obviously, your refusal to believe in it as divine Word is not based on knowledge, but on conjecture, which may possibly be right as well as wrong.
  - Now consider both the possibilities. If your conjecture were right, then, according to your own thinking, both the believers and the unbelievers would be equal, because both will became dust after death, and there is no life of Hereafter where belief and unbelief might be distinguished.
  - But, if this Quran were really from God, and that of which it is forewarning did really take place, then think what doom you would invite for yourselves by denying it and opposing it like that.
  - Therefore, your own interest demands that you should give up stubbornness and consider this Quran seriously; if even after due consideration, you decide not to believe in it, you may not, but you should not oppose it to the extent that you start employing falsehood and deception and persecution to bar the way of its message and prevent others from believing in it, not being content with your own unbelief.

## Ayat 53

- `Soon shall We show them Our Signs on the horizons and in their own beings until it becomes clear to them that it is the Truth.`- `Is it not enough that your Lord is a witness over everything?`



- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse has two meanings and both have been given by the major commentators:
    - First, that they will soon see wit their own eyes that the message of the Quran has spread in all the adjoining lands, and they themselves have yielded to it. Then they will realize that what they are being told today, which they are denying, was absolutely true.
    - Some people have objected to this meaning, saying that a message’s being dominant and overwhelming vast areas is no argument to prove that it is the truth. False messages also become dominant and their adherents also go on subduing one country after the other. But this is a superficial objection which has been raised without a thorough study of the matter. The wonderful conquests that Islam achieved in the period of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the rightly guided Caliphs, were not the signs of Allah only in the sense that the believers conquered one country after the other, but in the sense that this conquest of the countries was not like other conquests of the world, which make one man or one family or one nation master of the life and property of others and God’s earth is filled with tyranny and injustice. **Contrary to this, this conquest brought with it a great religious, moral, intellectual, cultural, political, economic and social revolution; whose influence, wherever it reached, elicited what was best in man and suppressed what was worst in him.** This revolution developed and nurtured the moral excellences which the world could hope to see only in the hermits and the meditating recluses and could never imagine that they could also be found among the people responsible for running the worldly affairs in the politics of the rulers, in the chambers of justice, in the wars and conquests of the commanders of forces, in the work of the tax collectors and in the commerce of the big businessmen. This revolution so raised the common people in the society created by it in respect of the sense of morality, character, cleanliness and purity that even the select people of other societies seemed to be much inferior to them. It took man out of the labyrinths of superstition and whim and put him on the broad highway of scientific research and rational thought and action. It treated and cured these diseases of the collective life of whose treatment no idea existed in the other systems, or if at all they tried to treat them, they did not succeed in it. For example, separation between men on the basis of color, race, country and language, classification of men in the same society and discrimination among them, non existence of legal rights and equality in practical life, degeneration of women and their deprivation of the basic rights, prevalence of crime, liquor drinking and use of all intoxicating drugs, the governments being above criticism and accountability, deprivation of the fundamental human rights the masses, disrespect of agreements in international relations, barbarism in wars, and such other diseases.
    - In Arabia itself this revolution brought about order in place of chaos, peace in place of bloodshed and anarchy, piety in place of wickedness, justice in place of tyranny and injustice, purity and culture in place of filth and indecency, knowledge in place of ignorance, brotherhood and love in place of long-standing feuds, and it made a nation whose people could not dream of anything beyond leadership of their tribe, leaders of the world. These were the signs which the very generation before whom the Prophet (peace be upon him) had recited this verse for the first time, saw with their own eyes, and after that till today Allah has been constantly showing those signs.
    - The Muslims, even during their downfall, displayed such high morals as could never be attained by those people who represent as the leaders of civilization and culture. No precedent can be found from any period of the history of the Muslims of the tyrannical treatment that has been meted out by the European nations to the subdued nations of Africa, America, Asia and of Europe itself. This is the blessing of the Quran which has so humanized Muslims that they could not become so tyrannical even when they had attained domination as the non-Muslims have been in all periods of history and are even today.
    - A person who has eyes can himself see how the Muslims treated the Christians in Spain when they ruled it for centuries, and how the Christians treated the Muslims when they gained power there; how the Muslims behaved towards Hindus during their eight hundred year long rule in India and how the Hindus are now treating them after they have attained power; how the Muslims treated the Jews during the past 1300 years and how the Jews are treating the Muslims in Palestine.


## Ayat 54

- `Lo, they are in doubt concerning their meeting with their Lord.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the basic cause of their attitude and conduct is that they are not sure that they will ever have to appear before their Lord and be held accountable for their deeds and actions.
- `Surely He fully encompasses everything.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they cannot escape His grasp nor can anything of their deeds be prevented from being recorded by Him.
