**Ayat 45 - 44**

## Ayat 45

- `And in the past We gave Moses the Book and yet it became an object of dispute.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, some people had believed in it and some others had made up their minds to oppose it.
- `If your Lord's decree had not gone forth before, a decisive judgement would have been made among them, once and for all.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It has two meanings:
      - (1) If Allah had not already decreed that the people would be given enough respite for consideration the disputants would have long been destroyed.
- `Surely they are in a disquieting doubt about it.`
