**Ayat 01 - 08**

## Ayat 01

- `Ha'. Mim.`

## Ayat 02

- `This is a revelation from the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate,`

## Ayat 03

- `a Book whose verses have been well-expounded;`
- `an Arabic Qur'an for those who have knowledge,`

## Ayat 04

- `one bearing good news and warning.`
- `Yet most of them turned away and are not wont to give heed.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is a brief introduction to the Surah. A study of the following discourse can show what relevance the things mentioned in it have with the theme that follows.
  - The first thing said is that this Word is being sent down by God, as if to say: You, O people, may go on saying again and again that this Word is being composed by Muhammad (peace be upon him) but the fact is that its revelation is from God, Lord of the worlds. 
  - Furthermore, the addressees have also been warned, so as to say: If you express your displeasure on hearing this discourse, this displeasure is not against Muhammad (peace be upon him) but is against God. If you reject it, you reject Allah’s Word, not a man’s word. And if you turn away from it, you do not turn away from a man but from Allah.

## Ayat 05

  - `“Our hearts are securely wrapped up against what you call us to,`

  - `and in our ears is a heaviness,`

  - `So act; we too are acting.”`

## Ayat 06

- `Tell them, (O Prophet):`
  - `“I am only a human being like you.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, it is not in my power to remove the covering that envelops your hearts, open your ears, and tear away the curtain which you have drawn between me and yourselves. I am only a man. I can make only him understand who is inclined to listen, and can only meet him who is ready to meet with me.
  - `It is revealed to me that your God is One God;`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, you may, if you so like, put coverings on your hearts and make your ears deaf, but the fact is that you don’t have many gods: there is only One God, whose servants you are. And this is no philosophy, which I might have thought out myself, and which might have equal probability of being true or false, but this reality has been made known to me through revelation, which cannot admit of any likelihood of error.
  - `so direct yourselves straight to Him,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, do not make any other your God: do not serve and worship any other deity: do not invoke and bow to any other for help: and do not obey and follow the customs and laws and codes made and set by others.
  - `and seek His forgiveness.`
  - `Woe to those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Seek for His forgiveness: Ask for His forgiveness for the unfaithfulness that you have been showing so far towards Him, for the shirk and disbelief and disobedience that you have been committing till now, and for the sins that you happened to commit due to forgetfulness of God.
