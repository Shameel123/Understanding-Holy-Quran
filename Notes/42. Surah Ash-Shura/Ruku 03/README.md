**Ayat 20 - 29**

## Ayat 20

- `Whoever seeks the harvest of the Hereafter, We shall increase for him his harvest,`
- `and whoever seeks the harvest of this world, We shall give him thereof; but he will have no share in the Hereafter.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Two of the truths have been mentioned in the previous verse, which we are observing everywhere at all times:

## Ayat 21

- `Do they have any associates (of Allah) who have laid down for them a way pertaining to faith which Allah did not sanction?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this verse the word shuraka (associates) obviously does not mean those beings whom the people invoke, or those in whose names they make offerings, or those before whom they carry out rites of worship, but inevitably it refers to those men whom the people regard as associates in the authority and sovereignty of Allah, whose thoughts, creeds, ideologies and philosophies they believe in, whose values they adopt, whose moral precepts and norms of civilization and culture they accept, and whose laws and rules and regulations they adopt to their rituals and rites of worship, in their personal and collective lives, in their trade and business dealings, in their politics and governments, as if they constituted the shariah that they had to follow faithfully.
    - This is a complete code of life which the inventors invented against the legislation of Allah, Lord of the worlds, without His sanction and followed by the followers. This is the same sort of shirk as prostrating oneself before another and invoking another than Allah.
    - (For further explanation, see (Surah An-Nisa, Ayat 60); (Surah Al-Maidah, Ayat 87); (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayats 121, 136,137); (Surah At-Taubah, Ayat 31); (Surah Younus, Ayat 59); (Surah Ibrahim, Ayat 22);(Surah An-Nahl, Ayats 115- 116); (Surah Al-Kahf, Ayat 52); (Surah Al-Qasas, Ayats 62-64); (Surah Saba, Ayat 41); (Surah YaSeen, Ayat 74 and the relevant E.N.s).)
- `But for the fact that a decree had already been made, the matter between them would have been decided once and for all.`
- `Surely a grievous chastisement awaits the wrong-doers.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, this is such a boldness against Allah that had not judgment been deferred till Resurrection, the torment would have been sent down on every such person, who in spite of being Allah’s servant, enforced his own religion and way of life on Allah’s earth, and those people also would have been visited by it, who forsook Allah’s religion and accepted the religion invented by others.


## Ayat 22

- `You will see the wrongdoers fearful of the consequence of their deeds which will certainly overtake them.`
- `But those who have faith and do good deeds will be in the meadows of the Gardens, wherein they shall have whatever they desire from their Lord; that is the great Bounty.`

## Ayat 23

- `That is the Bounty of which Allah gives tidings to His servants who have faith and do good deeds.`
- `Tell them, (O Prophet):`
  - `“I do not ask you for any recompense for my work`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, every effort that the prophet (peace be upon him) was making to save the people from Allah’s punishment and to enable them to become worthy of the promise of Paradise.
  - `except love towards kinsfolk.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The word qurba in the original has been interpreted differently by the different commentators.
      - One section of them takes it in the meaning of kinship and has given this meaning to the verse: I do not ask of you any reward for this service, but I do desire that you (O people of Quraish) should show some regard for the kinship that is there between me and you. You should have accepted my invitation, but if you do not accept it, you should not be so hard-hearted as to become my bitterest enemies in the entire land of Arabia.
      - This is the interpretation given by Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas, which has been cited by lmam Ahmad, Bukhari. Muslim. Tirmidhi, Ibn Jarir, Tabarani, Baihaqi. Ibn Said and others on the authority of many reporters and the same commentary has been given by Mujahid. Ikrimah, Qatadah, Suddi, Abu Malik, Abdur Rehman bin Zaid bin Aslam, Dahhak. Ata bin Dinar and the other major commentators.
- `Whoever does a good deed, We shall increase its merit for him.`
- `Surely Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Appreciative.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The other section takes qurba in the meaning of nearness and interprets the verse to mean: **I do not seek from you any other reward than this that you should develop in yourselves a desire for attaining nearness to Allah.** That is, you should be reformed. That is my only reward.
    - This commentary has been reported from Hasan Basri and a saying of Qatadah also has been cited in support of this, so much so that in a tradition by Tabarani this saying has also been attributed to Ibn Abbas.
    - In the Quran itself, at another place, this same subject has been treated, thus: Tell them: I do not seek of you any reward for this work. I only ask of the one, who will, to adopt the way of his Lord.(Surah Al-Furqan, Ayat 57).

## Ayat 24

- `Do they say:`
  - `“He has forged a lie against Allah?”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - In this interrogative sentence the style is of severe reproach. It means: O Prophet (peace be upon him): Have these people become so bold and fearless that they do not feel any shame in accusing you of inventing a lie, and that too of a heinous sin against Allah? They calumniate you that you are forging the Quran yourself and then falsely attributing to Allah.
- `If Allah so wanted He could seal up your heart.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, such big lies are only uttered by those whose hearts have been sealed up. If Allah wills, He may include you also among them, but it is His mercy that He has kept you away from them. This answer contains a severe satire against the people who were so accusing the Prophet (peace be upon him). It means this: O Prophet, they think that you are a man like them. Just as they are in the habit of uttering any big lie only for the sake of a selfish motive, so they thought you also must have forged a lie for selfish ends. But it is Allah’s mercy that He has not sealed up your heart as He has sealed up theirs.
- `Allah blots out falsehood and confirms the truth by His Words.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it is Allah’s way that He does not grant stability to falsehood, and in the long run proves the truth to be true. Therefore, O Prophet (peace be upon him), you should go on doing your mission, without paying any attention to their false accusations. A time will come when this whole falsehood will vanish like dust, and the truth of that which you are presenting will become visible and manifest.
- `He is well aware of all the secrets hidden in the breasts (of people).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, He knows why you are being thus falsely accused and what are the actual motives that are working behind all this struggle that is being made to frustrate and defeat you.

## Ayat 25

- `He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants and forgives sins and knows all what you do,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Calling the people’s attention to repentance immediately after the preceding verse by itself gives the meaning, as if to say: O wicked people, why are you making yourselves still more worthy of God’s punishment by falsely accusing the true Prophet? If you desist from your misdeeds even now, and offer true repentance, Allah will forgive you. **Repentance means that one should feel remorse for the evil he has done, and should refrain and desist from it in the future.** Moreover, it is also an inevitable demand of true repentance that one should try his utmost to compensate for the evil he has done in the past, and wherever compensation is not possible, he should seek Allah’s forgiveness and should do more and more good to wipe off the blot from himself. But no repentance can be true repentance unless it is offered with the intention of pleasing Allah. Giving up an evil for some other reason or intention is no repentance at all.

## Ayat 26

- `and answers the prayers of those who believe and do good deeds and bestows upon them even more out of His Bounty.`
- `As for those who deny (the Truth), a grievous chastisement awaits them.`


## Ayat 27

- `If Allah were to grant ample sustenance to His servants they would go about transgressing in the land.`
- `But He sends down in due measure whatever (sustenance) He wills.`
- `Surely He is Well-Aware and All-Seeing concerning matters that relate to His servants.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - If the context in which this thing has been said is kept in view, it appears that Allah here is alluding to the basic factor that was working in the rebellion of the disbelievers of Makkah. 
  - Although they were insignificant as against the mighty Roman and Iranian Empires and their position among the nations of the neighboring countries was no more than of a commercial tribe of a backward people, the relative prosperity and glory that they enjoyed among the other Arabs had made them so proud and arrogant that they were not inclined even to listen to the Prophet (peace be upon him) of Allah, and their chiefs of the tribes regarded it below their dignity that Muhammad bin Abdullah (peace be upon him) should be their guide and they his followers.
  - On this it is being said: If We had actually opened up the gates of provisions for these mean people, they would have burst with pride. But We are watching over them, and are providing for them only sparingly so as to keep them within limits. 
  - According to this meaning this verse, in other words, is touching on the same subject which has already been treated in (Surah At- Taubah, Ayats 68-70); (Surah Al-Kahf, Ayats 32-42);(Surah Al-Qasas, Ayats 75-82); (Surah Ar-Room, Ayat 9); (Surah Saba, Ayats 34-36 )and (Surah Al-Mumin, Ayats 82-85).

## Ayat 28

- `He it is Who sends down the rain after they despair of it, spreading out His Mercy.`
- `He is the Protector, the Immensely Praiseworthy.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here, the word wali implies the Being who is the Governor of the affairs of all His creations, Who has taken the responsibility of fulfilling all the needs and requirements of His servants.

## Ayat 29

- `And of His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the living creatures that He has spread out in them.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “In them both”: In both the earth and the heavens.
- `He has the power to bring them together when He so wills.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, just as He has the power to disperse them, so He has also the power to gather them all together. Therefore, it is wrong to think that Resurrection cannot take place, and all the former and the latter generations cannot be raised up and gathered all together.
