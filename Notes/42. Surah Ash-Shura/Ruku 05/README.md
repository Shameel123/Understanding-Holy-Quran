**Ayat 44 - 53**

## Ayat 44

- `He whom Allah lets go astray, none after Him can be his protector.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Allah sent the best Book like the Quran for the guidance of the people, which is giving them the knowledge of the reality in a rational and effective way and guiding them to the right way of life. He sent a Prophet like Muhammad (peace be upon him) for their guidance, a man of better character than whom they had never seen before. And then Allah also showed them the results of the teaching and training of this Book and this Messenger in the lives of the believers. Now, if after witnessing all this, a person turns away from the guidance, Allah casts him into the same deviation from which he has no desire to come out. And when Allah Himself has driven him away, who else can take the responsibility of bringing him to the right way.
- `You will see that when the wrong-doers observe the chastisement, they will exclaim:`
  - `“Is there any way to go back?”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, today when there is a chance of coming back, they are refusing to come back. Tomorrow when the judgment will have been passed and the sentence enforced, then seeing their fate they will wish to come back.

## Ayat 45

- `You shall see them, as they are brought face to face with the chastisement, in a state of abject humiliation, looking with a furtive glance.`
- `But the believers will say:`
  - `“Surely the true losers are they who lose themselves and their kindred on the Day of Resurrection.”`
- `Lo, the wrong-doers will be in an enduring torment.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - By nature man is such that when a dreadful scene comes before him and he knows that soon he is going to fall a prey to it, he closes his eyes forthwith in fear. Then, when he cannot hold himself any longer, he tries to see what kind of the calamity it is and how far away it is from him. But he does not find the courage to lift up his head and have a full view of it. Therefore, he opens his eyes a little again and again and sees it from the corner of the eye, and then again closes his eyes from fear. The same state of those who will be driven to Hell has been depicted here.

## Ayat 46

- `They shall have no protectors to help them against Allah.`
- `For he whom Allah causes to go astray will have no way to save himself.`

## Ayat 47

- `Accept the command of your Lord before there comes a Day from Allah that cannot be averted.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, neither will Allah Himself avert it, nor has anyone else the power to avert it.
- `On that Day there shall be no shelter for you, and none may change your predicament.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This sentence has several other meanings also:

## Ayat 48

- `(O Prophet), if they turn away from the Truth, know that We did not send you to them as their overseer.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you have not been made responsible that you must bring them to the right path anyhow, nor will you be held accountable as to why these people did not come to the right path.
- `Your task is only to convey (the Message).`
- `Indeed when We give man a taste of Our Mercy, he exults in it.`
- `But if any misfortune afflicts them on account of their deeds, man is utterly ungrateful.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Man here implies the mean and shallow people who are the subject of the discourse here, who have gotten a measure of the worldly provisions and are exulting in this, and who do not pay any attention when they are admonished to come to the right path. But when they are visited by a disaster in consequence of their own misdeeds, they start cursing their fate, and forget all those blessings which Allah has blessed them with, and do not try to understand how far they themselves are to be blamed for the condition in which they are placed. Thus, neither does prosperity become conducive to their reformation nor can adversity teach them a lesson and bring them to the right path.
    - A study of the context shows that this is, in fact, a satire on the attitude of the people who were the addressees of the above discourse, but they have not been addressed to tell them of their weakness directly, but the weakness of man has been mentioned in a general way and pointed out that what is the real cause of his sad plight. This gives an important point of the wisdom of preaching: the weaknesses of the addressee should not be made the target directly, but they should be mentioned in a general way so that he is not provoked, and if his conscience has still some life in it, he may try to understand his shortcoming with a cool mind.

## Ayat 49

- `The dominion of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah.`
- `He creates whatever He pleases.`
- `He grants females to whomever He pleases and males to whomever He pleases,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, if the people who are involved in disbelief and polytheism do not believe even after the admonition, they may not, for the truth is the truth. The kingdom of the earth and heavens has not been entrusted to the so-called kings and despots and chiefs of the world nor has any prophet, saint, god or goddess any share in it, but its Master is One Allah alone. His rebel can neither succeed by his own power, nor can any of the beings whom the people look upon as owners of divine powers by their own folly, come to their rescue and aid.

## Ayat 50

- `or grants them a mix of males and females, and causes whomever He pleases to be barren.`
- `He is All- Knowing, All-Powerful.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is a manifest proof of Allah’s Sovereignty being absolute.
  - No man, whether he be posing as owner of the highest worldly authority, or regarded as owner of great spiritual powers, has ever been able to produce children for himself according to his own choice and desire, not to speak of providing children for others.
  - The one whom Allah made barren could not have children through any medicine, any treatment, any amulet or charm. The one whom Allah gave only daughters could not get a single son by any device, and the one whom Allah gave only sons could not have a single daughter by any means.
  - In this matter everyone is absolutely helpless. Even after seeing all this if some one posed to be all-powerful in God’s kingdom, or regarded another as a possessor of the powers, it would be his own shortsightedness for which he himself will suffer, the truth will not change at all.

## Ayat 51

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In conclusion, the same theme with which the discourse began has been reiterated. To understand it fully, please see the( first verse of this Surah and the E.N). on it.

- `It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him except through revelation,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here, wahi means to inspire somebody with something, or to show something to somebody in a vision as were the Prophets Abraham and Joseph shown (peace be upon them). See (Surah Yousuf, Ayats 4, 100); (Surah As-Saaffat, Ayat 102).
- `or from behind a veil,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, one may hear a voice without seeing the speaker, just as it happened in the case of the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) when he suddenly began to hear a voice from a tree on Mount Toor, while the speaker was hidden from him.
      - See(Surah TaHa, Ayats 11-48), (Surah An- Naml, Ayats 8-12); (Surah Al-Qasas, Ayats 30 35).
- `or that a messenger (an angel) be sent to him who reveals to him by Allah's leave whatever He wishes.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the form of wahi by which all divine Scriptures have actually reached the Prophets of Allah. Some people have misinterpreted this sentence and given it this meaning Allah sends a messenger who by His command conveys His message to the common people. But the words of the Quran fa-yuhiya bi-idni-hi ma yasha (then He reveals by His command whatever He wills) show that this interpretation is absolutely wrong.
    - The Prophets’s preaching before the common people has neither been called wahi anywhere in the Quran nor is there any room in Arabic for describing a man’s speaking to another man openly by the word wahi. Lexically, wahi means secret and swift instruction. Only an ignorant person will apply this word to the common preaching by the Prophets.
- `He is All-High, Most Wise.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, He is far above that He should speak to a man face to face, and His wisdom is not helpless that He may adopt another method of conveying His instructions to a servant of His than of speaking to him face to face.

## Ayat 52

- `Even so We revealed to you, (O Prophet), a spirit by Our command.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “And thus” does not refer only to the last method of wahi, but to all the three methods as mentioned in the preceding verses, and a spirit implies wahi (revelation), or the teaching given to the Prophet (peace be upon him) by revelation. 
    - Both the Quran and the Hadih confirm that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was given instruction by all these three methods:
- `(Ere to that) you knew neither what the Book nor what the faith was.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - (1) In a Hadith Aishah has stated that revelation in the beginning came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the form of true visions. (Bukhari, Muslim) This continued in later life also. Traditions mention many visions in which he was given some teaching or informed of something and in the Quran also a vision of his has been clearly mentioned (Surah Al-Fath, Ayat 27). 
    - Besides, several traditions also mention that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: I have been inspired with such and such a thing, or I have been informed of this and this, or I have been enjoined this, or I have been forbidden this.
    - All such things relate to the first kind of the wahi and the divinely inspired traditions (Ahadith Qudsi) mostly belong to this category of the traditions.
- `But We made that spirit a light whereby We guide those of Our servants whom We please to the Right Way.`
- `Surely you are directing people to the Right Way,`

## Ayat 53

- `the Way of Allah, to Whom belongs the dominion of all that is in the heavens and the earth.`
- `o, it is to Allah that all things ultimately revert.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the final warning that has been given to the disbelievers. It means: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said something and you heard and rejected it. The matter would not end there. Whatever is happening in the world, will be presented before Allah, and ultimately He Himself will decide what should be the end of every person.
