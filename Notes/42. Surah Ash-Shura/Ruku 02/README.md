**Ayat 10 - 19**

## Ayat 10

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - From here to the end of( verse 12), though the whole discourse is a revelation from Allah, the speaker is not Allah but the Messenger (peace be upon him) of Allah.
  - In other words, Allah Almighty is telling His Prophet (peace be upon him) to make this proclamation to the people. **Such themes in the Quran sometimes begin with qul (say, O Prophet) and sometimes without it**. Only the style indicates that the speaker at a place is not Allah but Allah’s Messenger.
  - Even at some places though the words are Allah’s, the speaker are the believers, as for example in Surah Surah Al-Fatiha. Or, the speaker are the angels as in (Surah Maryam, Ayats 64-65).

- `The judgement on whatever you differ rests with Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the natural and logical demand of Allah Almighty’s being the Master of the Universe and His being the real Guardian. When Sovereignty and Guardianship belong to Him only inevitably He alone is also the Ruler.
    - And it is for Him to judge human beings’ mutual disputes and differences. Those who restrict it only to the Hereafter make a mistake. There is no argument to prove that Allah’s position as a Ruler has no effect in this world but is meant only for the life Hereafter. Likewise, those who restrict it only to beliefs and a few questions of religious nature are also in the wrong. The words are general and they clearly proclaim Allah as having the sole right to judge all disputes and differences.
    - According to them, just as Allah is the Master of the Day of Judgment in the Hereafter; so He is the best of Judges in this world too. And just as He is the Settler of the differences pertaining to beliefs as to what is the truth and what is falsehood, so also in legal matters He is the Settler of differences as to what is pure for man and what is impure, what is lawful and desirable for him and what is forbidden and undesirable. 
    - What is evil and vicious in morals and what is good and virtuous, what are the rights of the people in their mutual dealings and what are the right practices in social political and economic life and what are wrong.
    - On this very basis the Quran has declared this principle as the fundamental of law:
      - If there arises any dispute between you about anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger. (Surah An-Nisa, Ayat 59). And: **It does not behoove a believing man and a believing woman that when Allah and His Messenger have given their verdict in a matter, they should exercise an option in that matter of theirs.**
        - (Surah Al-Ahzab, Ayat 36).
      - And: **O people, follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord and do not follow other patrons beside Him.**
        - (Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 3).
- `Such is Allah, my Lord;`
- `in Him I have put all my trust and to Him I always turn in devotion.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Then, in the context in which this verse has occurred, it gives another meaning also and that is: To decide differences is not only Allah’s legal right on accepting or rejecting which depends on man’s being a believer or an unbeliever, but Allah, in fact, practically also is deciding between the truth and falsehood due to which falsehood and its worshipers are ultimately being destroyed and the truth and the faithful are being honored and exalted, no matter how delayed the enforcement of this decision may seem to be.
  - This theme occurs in (verse 24) below, and has been expressed at several places in the Quran. For this please see (Surah Ar-Raad, Ayats 17,41); (Surah Ibrahim, Ayats 24-27); (Surah Bani Israil, Ayat 8);(Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 18, 44 and the E.Ns).

## Ayat 11

- `The Originator of the heavens and the earth,`
- `He has appointed for you pairs of your own kind, and pairs also of cattle.`
- `Thus does He multiply you.`
- `Naught in the universe is like Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Literally, “Nothing is like His likeness,” which implies this: Even if there were a likeness of Allah, nothing would be like it, not to speak of being like unto Allah Himself.
- `He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, at one and the same time He is hearing everybody and seeing everything in the Universe.

## Ayat 12

- `His are the keys of the heavens and the earth.`
- `He enlarges and straitens the sustenance of whomsoever He pleases.`
- `Surely He has knowledge of everything.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - These are the arguments to prove why Allah alone is the true Guardian and why putting trust in Him alone is right and correct and why He alone should be turned to in all matters. (For explanation, see(Surah An-Naml, Ayats 60-66); (Surah Ar-Room, Ayats 20-22 and the E.Ns)).

## Ayat 13

- `He has prescribed for you the religion which He enjoined upon Noah and which We revealed to you (O Muhammad), and which We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus, commanding:`
  - `“Establish this religion and do not split up regarding it.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Here the same thing as already mentioned in the first verse has been further elaborated. It clearly states that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is not the founder of any new religion, nor was any of the Prophets a founder of a separate religion, **but it has been one and the same religion which all the Prophets have been presenting from Allah from the very beginning, and the same is being presented by Muhammad (peace be upon him)**.
      - In this regard, the first name mentioned is of the Prophet Noah (peace be upon him), who was the first Prophet after the Flood. After him the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has been mentioned, who is the last of the Prophets; then the Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) has been mentioned, whom the Arabs acknowledged as their guide, and last of all, the Prophets Moses and Jesus (peace be upon them) have been mentioned to whom the Jews and the Christians attribute their religions.
      - This does not mean that only these five Prophets had been enjoined this religion, but what is meant to be said is that all the Prophets who came to this world, brought one and the same religion and the names of the five illustrious Prophets have been mentioned only as examples through whom the world received the most well known codes of divine law.
- `What you are calling to is very hard upon those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity.`
- **`Allah chooses for Himself whomsoever He pleases and guides to Himself whoever penitently turns to Him.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - As this verse throws important light on Deen (religion) and its aim, it is necessary that we should study it to understand it well.

## Ayat 14

- `They did not split up except after knowledge had come to them,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the divisions were created not because Allah had failed to send the Prophets and the Books, and therefore, the people could not know the right way and so invented their own separate religions, sects, schools of thought and systems of life, **but divisions appeared after knowledge had come to them from Allah**. Therefore, Allah is not responsible for it, but the people who abandoned the clear principles of religion and commands of the Shariah and created their own creeds and religions are themselves responsible for it.
- `and then only because they wished to commit excesses against each other.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the motive for creating the divisions was not good, but they resulted from the desire for ostentation, love of an independent entity, mutual rivalry and stubbornness, the urge to humiliate and defeat one another, and greed for worldly wealth and position.
    - When the clever and ambitious saw that if the godly people followed the true religion honestly, there would only be One God before whom the people would bow, there would be one Messenger whom they would acknowledge as their guide and leader, there would be one Book which they would turn to and there would be a clearly defined creed and code of life which they would be following. In such a system there could be no place of distinction for themselves, on the strength of which they could have their own leadership flourish so that the people should rally round them, and bow to them and also make rich offerings to them.
    - This was the real cause which became the motive of the invention of new creeds and philosophies, new ways and rites of worship and new systems of life, and diverted a large part of humanity from the highway of divine religion and misled them into blind alleys. Then the mutual disputes of the factions and their religious, economic and political conflicts gave rise to intense bitterness, which in turn led to bloodshed and violence among humanity.
- `Had your Lord not already decreed that judgement would be made later at an appointed time, the matter between them would surely have been decided once and for all.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, all such people who were guilty of inventing false systems and followed them would have been annihilated in the world itself by a torment, and only the righteous ones allowed to survive, which should have indicated as to who was a follower of the truth and who of falsehood in the sight of Allah. But Allah has deferred this decision till Resurrection, for after such a decision in the world, the trial of mankind becomes meaningless.
- `Indeed those who were later made the heirs of the Book are in disquieting doubt about it.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It means: After the passage of the time of every Prophet and his closest followers when the divine Book reached the later generations, they did not receive it with faith and conviction but were involved in doubts and suspicions and confusions about it. 
    - There were many causes for this state of affairs, which can be easily understood by a study of the case of the Torah and the Gospel. **The earlier generations have not conveyed both these Books to the later generations well preserved in their original state and in their original words and language.** They mixed up the divine word in them with the human word in the form of their commentary, history, verbal traditions and juristic hair-splitting. They made their translations prevail until the original was lost and only the translations remained. Their historical authenticity also was ruined, so much so that nobody now can say with certainty that the Book in his hand is the same that the world had once received through the Prophet Moses or the Prophet Jesus (peace be upon them). Then their elders in the different periods of history initiated such discussions on religion, divinity, philosophy, law, physics, psychology and sociology and invented such systems of thought that the people were lost in them and it became impossible for them to decide as to which was the straight highway of the truth among the countless crooked ways.
    - And since the divine Book did not exist in its original, reliable state, they could neither turn to any authority that could help them to distinguish the truth from falsehood.

## Ayat 15

- `(This being so, O Muhammad), call people to the same religion and be steadfast about it as you were commanded, and do not follow their desires,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, do not make any change nor effect any increase or decrease in this religion only to please them. Do not resort to any compromises with the misguided people on the principle of give and take. Do not make any room in the religion for their whims, prejudices and practices of ignorance in the hope that they would embrace Islam. Let the one who wants to accept, accept the original, pure religion of God, as sent down by Him, straight forwardly; otherwise let him go and enter any hell that he chooses for himself. The religion of God cannot be changed for the sake of the people; if the people are desirous of their own well being and true success, let them change their ways and mold themselves according to it.
- `and say (to them):`
  - `“I believe in the Book Allah has sent down.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - In other words, I am not like those schismatic people who believe in some Books sent down by God and disbelieve in others; I believe in every Book sent down by Him.
  - `I have been commanded to establish justice among you.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This sentence has several meanings:
        - (1) I have been appointed to discard the schisms and adopt true impartiality. I do not like to harbor prejudice in favor of one and against the other schism. **I have one and the same kind of relationship with all human beings, and it is the relationship of justice and equity.** I am a companion and supporter of everyone who follows the truth, whether he is an utter stranger for me, and an opponent of everyone who follows falsehood, whether he is a neighbor or a close kinsman.
        - (2) There is no place of distinction for anybody in the system of truth, which I have, been appointed to present before you. **It honors everyone equally.** It does not contain separate sets of the rights for the kindred and the stranger, the big and the small, the poor and the rich, the noble and the humble. Whatever is good in it is good for everyone, and whatever is sinful and unlawful and criminal in it is sinful, unlawful and criminal for everybody. In its just system, there is no exception even for my own self.
  - `Allah is our Lord and your Lord.`
  - `We have our deeds and you have your deeds.`
  - `There is no contention between us and you.`
  - `Allah will bring us all together.`
  - `To Him all are destined to return.”`

## Ayat 16

- `Those who contend concerning Allah (after His call has been responded to), their contention is absolutely void in the sight of their Lord.`
- `Allah's wrath is upon them and a grievous chastisement awaits them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is an allusion to the state of affairs that was being experienced in Makkah at that time almost daily. Whenever it became known about somebody that he had become a Muslim, the people would start treating him mercilessly. They would worry and vex him, would neither let him have peace in the house nor in the street nor in society. Wherever he went, they would start an endless discussion with the object to somehow make him abandon Muhammad (peace be upon him) and return to the same creed of ignorance which he had rejected.

## Ayat 17

- `Allah it is Who sent down this Book with the Truth and the Balance.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Mizan (Balance): the Shariah of Allah, which, like a balance, brings out clearly the distinction between the right and the wrong, the truth and falsehood, justice and injustice, and righteousness and wickedness. In( verse 15) above, the Prophet (peace be upon him) has been made to say: I have been commanded to do justice between you. Here, it has been told that with this Book the Balance has come by which justice will be established.
- `And what would make you know that the Hour (of Judgement) has drawn near?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the one who is inclined to mend his ways, must mend his ways forthwith, he should not lose time under the delusion that the Hour of Judgment is yet far off. Man cannot be sure whether he will be able to take another breath or not, his present breath may be his last.

## Ayat 18

- `Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten its coming.`
- `But those who believe (in it) hold it in dread and know that the Hour (of Judgement) is bound to come.`
- `Lo, those who dispute concerning the coming of the Hour are gone far in error.`

## Ayat 19

- `Allah is Most Gentle to His servants`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word “Subtle” cannot fully convey the meaning of the word Latif as used in the original. This word contains two meanings: 
      - First, that Allah is very Kind and Compassionate to His servants;
      - second, that He is a subtle observer and keeps in view even their minutest and most ordinary needs, which none else can see, and He fulfills them in such ways that they themselves do not perceive as to which need of theirs has been fulfilled at what time and by whom.
    - Then the slaves here does not imply only the believers but all slaves. That is, Allah is Kind and Compassionate to all His slaves.
- `and grants sustenance to whomsoever He pleases.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It means: The demand of His general kindness and compassion is not this that all the slaves should be given everything equally. For, although He is providing for each and every one from His treasures, there is no equality and uniformity in the measure of His provisions. He has given one thing to one and another to another. He has provided someone with something in a greater measure and another with another thing more generously.
- `He is All-Strong, Most Mighty.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, His system of providence is functioning undo His own might. No one has the power to change it or take away something forcibly from Him, or prevent Him from providing for somebody.
