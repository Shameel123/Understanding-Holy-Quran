**Ayat 30 - 43**

## Ayat 30

- `Whatever misfortune befalls you is a consequence of your own deeds.`
- `But much of it He forgives.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - One should note that here the cause of all human afflictions is not being stated but the address is directed to the people who were at that time committing disbelief and disobedience at Makkah. They are being told: Had Allah seized you for all your sins and crimes, He would not have even allowed you to live. But the calamities (probably the allusion is to the famine of Makkah) that have descended on you, are only a warning so that you may take heed and examine your actions and deeds to see as to what attitude and conduct you have adopted as against your Lord. And you can try to understand how helpless you actually are against God against Whom you are rebelling, and know that those whom you have taken as your patrons and supporters, or the powers that you have relied upon, cannot avail you anything against the punishment of Allah.

## Ayat 31

- `You cannot frustrate Him in the earth;`
- `you have no protector nor helper against Allah.`

## Ayat 32

- `And of His Signs are the ships that sail in the sea like mountains.`

## Ayat 33

- `If He so wills, He can cause the winds to become still so that they will remain motionless on its surface.`
- `Surely there are many Signs in this for those who are wont to be steadfast and give thanks.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Signs for him who patiently endures, who keeps himself fully under control and remains steadfast on the path of servitude under all circumstances, good or bad; who does not forget himself so as to become rebellious against God and cruel to the people, when favored with good times, and loses heart and stoops to anything when visited by evil times. A grateful person is every such person who regards it as a bounty of Allah and not the result of any merit or excellence in himself when he is exalted to any high place of honor in life by a divine decree, and keeps his mind concentrated on the blessings which remain available to man even under the worst circumstances instead of his deprivations when deposed to the lowest of the low position. Thus, he continues to thank his Lord in both prosperity and adversity with his tongue and heart.

## Ayat 34

- `He may, while forgiving much of the sins of those that ride these ships, drown them on account of some of their misdeeds.`

## Ayat 35

- `Then those who wrangle about Our Signs will come to know that there is no escape for them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Quraish, in connection with their business and trade, had also to visit Habash and the coastal lands of Africa, and in these journeys they used sailing ships and boats for crossing the Red Sea, which is a very dangerous sea. It is generally stormy and abounds in submerged rocks which are a serious hazard for navigation especially during the storms. Therefore, the state that has been depicted here by Allah could be fully realized by the people of the Quraish in the light of their personal experiences.

## Ayat 36

- `That which has been given to you is only the wherewithal of the transient life of this world.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it is not a thing at which man should exult whatever worldly wealth a person has in his possession, he has it only for a short time. He uses it for a few years and then leaves the world empty-handed. Then, although the amount of the wealth may be very high in the ledgers, practically only a fraction of it is used by the man himself. To exult at such wealth does not behoove a man who understands the truth about himself, about his wealth and this world itself.
- `But that which is with Allah is better and more enduring`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, that wealth is far more superior as regards to its nature and quality and is also eternal and everlasting.
- `for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here, trust (tawakkul) in Allah has been regarded as an inevitable demand of the faith and a necessary characteristic for success in the Hereafter. Tawakkul means:

## Ayat 37

- `who eschew grave sins and shameful deeds,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - For explanation, see (Surah An-Nisa, Ayat 31); (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayat 151); (Surah An-Naml, Ayat 90);(Surah An- Najm, Ayat 32 and the E.Ns).
- `and whenever they are angry, forgive;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they are not wrathful and crazy but are temperate and cool minded. They are not revengeful but forbearing and forgiving by nature. If ever they feel angry at something they control their rage. This characteristic is the best of man’s qualities, which has been highly commended in the Quran (Surah Aal-Imran, Ayat 134) and regarded as a major factor of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) success (Surah Aal-Imran, Ayat 159). According to Aishah, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) never avenged himself on anybody, however, when a thing enjoined to be held sacred by Allah was desecrated, he would award the punishment. (Bukhari, Muslim).

## Ayat 38

- `who obey their Lord`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Literally: “Who answer the call of their Lord”, that is they hasten to do whatever Allah enjoins them to do, and accept whatever Allah invites them to accept.
- `and establish Prayer;`
- `who conduct their affairs by consultation,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This thing has been counted here as the best quality of the believers and has been enjoined in( Surah Aal-Imran, Ayat 159). On this basis, consultation is an important pillar of the Islamic way of life, and to conduct the affairs of collective life without consultation is not only the way of ignorance but also an express violation of the law prescribed by Allah. When we consider why consultation has been given such importance in Islam, three things become obvious:
- `and spend out of what We have bestowed upon them;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - First, that it is injustice that a person should decide a matter by his personal opinion and ignore others when it involves the interests of two or more persons. No one has a right to do, as he likes in matters of common interest. Justice demands that all those whose interests are involved in a matter be consulted, and if it concerns a large number of the people, their reliable representatives should be made a party in consultation.

## Ayat 39

- `who, when a wrong is done to them, seek its redress.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This also is one of the best characteristics of the believers, **they do not fall a prey to the tyrants**.
  - Their tender heartedness and forgiving nature is not the result of any weakness. They have not been taught to live humbly and meekly like the hermits and ascetics. Their nobility demands that when they are victors they should forgive the errors of the vanquished. When they possess the power, they should avoid vengefulness and when a weak or subdued person happens to commit a mistake they should overlook it. But when a powerful person, drunk with authority, commits violence against them, they should resist and fight him with all their might. A believer is never cowed by a wicked person nor bows to an arrogant man. For such people he proves to be a hard nut which breaks the teeth of those who try to break it.

## Ayat 40

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The passage from here to the end of (verse 43) is an explanation of verse 39.

- `The recompense of evil is evil the like of it.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the first fundamental principle which must be borne in mind in retaliation. The right limit of retaliation is that one should return the same sort of ill treatment that he has received; he has no right to return a greater ill treatment.
- `But he who forgives and makes amends, his reward lies with Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the second principle. It means: Although it is permissible to retaliate against the one who has committed a violence, wherever pardoning can be conducive to reconcilement, pardoning is better for the sake of reconcilement than retaliation.
    - And since man pardons the other by suppressing his own feelings, Allah says that the reward of such a one is with Him, for he has suppressed his own self for the sake of reforming the evil-doers.
- `Surely He does not love the wrong-doers.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this warning allusion has been made to a third principle about retaliation, and it is this: One should not become a wrongdoer himself in the process of avenging a wrong done by the other.
    - It is not permissible to do a greater wrong in retaliation for the wrong done. For example, if a person gives another a slap, the other can return only one slap; he cannot shower blows and kicks. 
    - Likewise, it is not right to commit a sin in retaliation for a sin. For example, if a wicked man has killed the son of someone, it is not right to go and kill the son of the former. Or, if a mean person has violated the chastity of a person’s sister or daughter, it is not lawful for him to commit rape on the former’s sister or daughter.

## Ayat 41

- `There is no blame against him who avenges himself after he has been wronged.`

## Ayat 42 

- `Blame attaches only to those who subject people to wrong and commit excesses on earth.`
- `A painful chastisement awaits them.`

## Ayat 43

- `But he who patiently endures and forgives, that is a conduct of great resolve.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - One should note that the qualities of the believers that have been mentioned in these verses, practically existed in the lives of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his companions, and the disbelievers of Makkah were their eye-witnesses. 
  - Thus, Allah has, in fact, told the disbelievers: The real wealth is not the provisions that you have received for passing the transitory life of the world, and are bursting with pride of it, but the real wealth are the morals and characteristics which the believers from your own society have developed by accepting the guidance given by the Quran.
