**Ayat 21 -30**

## Ayat 21


- `And who could be more wrong-doing than he who either foists a lie on Allah`
- `or gives the lie to His signs?`
- `Surely such wrong-doers shall not attain success.`


## Ayat 22

- `And on the Day when We shall gather them all together,`
- `We shall ask those who associated others with -Allah in His divinity:`
  - `'Where, now, are your partners whom you imagined (to have a share in the divinity of Allah)?'`


## Ayat 23

- `Then they will be able to play no mischief but will say (falsely):`
  - `'By Allah, our Lord, we associated none (with You in Your divinity).'`


## Ayat 24

- `Behold, how they will lie against themselves and how their forged deities will forsake them!`


## Ayat 25

- `And of them there are some who appear to pay heed to you,`
- `but upon their hearts We have laid coverings so they understand it not;`
- `and in their ears, heaviness (so they hear not).`
- `Even if they were to witness every sign, they would still not believe in it so much so that when they come to you, they dispute with you,`
- `those who disbelieve contend:`
  - `'This is nothing but fables of the ancient times.'`


## Ayat 26

- `As for others,`
- `they prevent them from embracing the Truth;`
- `and themselves, they flee from it (so as to harm you).`
- `But they court their own ruin, although they do not realize it.`


## Ayat 27

- `If you could but see when they shall be made to stand by the Fire!`
- `They will plead:`
  - `'Would that we were brought back to life?`
  - `Then we would not give the lie to the signs of our Lord`
  - `and would be among the believers.'`


## Ayat 28

- `No!`
- `They will say this merely because the Truth which they had concealed will become obvious to them;`
- `or else if they were sent back, they would still revert to what was forbidden to them.`
- `(So this plea of theirs would be a lie too) for they are just liars.`

## Ayat 29

- `They say now:`
  - `'There is nothing but the life of this world, and we shall not be raised from the dead.'`


## Ayat 30

- `If you could but see when they will be made to stand before their Lord.`
- `He will say:`
  - `'Is not this the truth?'`
- `They will say:`
  - `'Yes indeed, by our Lord.'`
- `Whereupon He will say:`
  - `'Taste the chastisement, then, for your denying the Truth.'`
