**Ayat 122 - 129**

## Ayat 122

- `He who was dead and whom We raised to life,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - 'Death' signifies here the state of ignorance and lack of consciousness, whereas 'life' denotes the state of knowledge and true cognition, the state of awareness of Reality.
    - He who cannot distinguish between right and wrong and does not know the Straight Way for human life, may be alive on the biological plane, but his essential humanity is not.
    - He may be a living animal but is certainly not a living human being.
    - A living human being is one who can distinguish right from wrong, good from evil, honesty from dishonesty.
- `and We set a light for him to walk among men - is he like the one steeped in darkness out of which he does not come out?.`
- `Thus have their own doings been made to seem fair to the unbelievers.`


## Ayat 123

- `Thus We have appointed the leaders of the wicked ones in every land to weave their plots;`
- `but in truth they plot only to their own harm, without even realizing it.`

## Ayat 124

- `Whenever there comes to them a sign from Allah, they say:`
  - `'We will not believe until we are given what was given to the Messengers of Allah.'`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This shows that they were unwilling to believe in the statement of the Prophets that an angel of God came to each of them and delivered the message of God.
      - They would believe, they said, only if the angel approached them directly and intimated God's message to them.
  - **`Allah knows best where to place His message.`**
  - `Soon shall these wicked ones meet with humiliation and severe chastigement from Allah for all their evil plotting.`

## Ayat 125

- `Thus, (it is a fact that) whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his breast for Islam;`
- `and whomsoever He wills to let go astray, He causes his breast to become strait and constricted, as if he were climbing towards the heaven.`
- `Thus Allah lays the abomination (of flight from and hatred of Islam) on those who do not believe`

## Ayat 126

- **`even though this way is the straight way of your Lord,`**
- **`and We have distinguished its signs to those who heed to admonition.`**

## Ayat 127

- `Theirs shall be an abode of peace with their Lord - their Protector - in recompense for all they have done.`

## Ayat 128

- `And on the Day when He shall muster them all together, He will say (to the jinn):`
  - `'O assembly of the jinn, you have seduced a good many of mankind.'`
- `And their companions from among the humans will say:`
  - `'Our Lord! We did indeed benefit from one another and now have reached the term which You had set for us.'`
- `Thereupon Allah will say:`
  - `'The Fire is now your abode, and therein you shall abide.'`
- **`Only those whom Allah wills shall escape the Fire.`**
- **`Surely your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.`**

## Ayat 129

- **`In this manner We shall make the wrong-doers friends of each other (in the Hereafter) because they earned (evil together in the world).`**
