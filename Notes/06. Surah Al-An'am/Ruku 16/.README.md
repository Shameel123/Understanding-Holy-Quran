**Ayat 130 - 140**

## Ayat 130

- `(Then Allah will also ask them):`
  - `'O assembly of jinn and men!`
  - `Did there not come to you Messengers from among yourselves, relating to you My signs, and warning you of the encounter of this your Day (of Judgement)?'`
- `They will say:`
    - `'Yes, we bear witness against ourselves.'`
- `They have been deluded by the life of this world, and they will bear witness against themselves that they had disbelieved.`

## Ayat 131

- `(They will be made to bear this witness to show that) it is not the way of your Lord to destroy cities unjustly while their people were unaware of the Truth.`

## Ayat 132

- `Everyone is assigned a degree according to his deed.`
- **`Your Lord is not heedless of what they do.`**

## Ayat 133

- **`Your Lord is Self-Sufficient, full of compassion.`**
- `If He wills, He can put you away and cause whomever He wills to succeed you just as He has produced you from the seed of another people.`

## Ayat 134

- `Surely what you have been promised shall come to pass;`
- `and you do not have the power to frustrate (Allah).`


## Ayat 135

- `Say (O Muhammad!):`
  - `'O people! Work in your place;`
  - `and I too am at work.`
  - `Soon you will know in whose favour the ultimate decision will be.`
  - `Surely the wrong-doers will not prosper.'`

## Ayat 136

- `They assign to Allah a portion out of the produce and cattle that He has created, saying out of their fancy:`
  - `'This is for Allah'`
  - `- so they deem -'`
- `and this is for the associates (of Allah) whom we have contrived.'`
- `Then, the portion assigned to the beings whom they have set up as associates (of Allah) does not reach Allah, but the portion assigned to Allah reaches the beings they set up as associates (of Allah)! Indeed evil is what they decide!`

I think this is for us in this age, we put some portion of our earnings for Zakat or Sadaqah but use other's in haram activities.

## Ayat 137 

- `And, likewise, the beings supposed to have a share in Allah's divinity have made the slaying of their offspring seem lawful to many of those who associate others with Allah in His divinity`
- `so that they may ruin them`
- `and confound them regarding their faith.`
- **`If Allah had so willed, they would not have done that.`**
- `Leave them alone to persist in their fabrication.`

## Ayat 138

- `They say:`
  - `'These animals and these crops are sacrosanct:`
  - `none may eat of them save those whom we will' -`
- `imposing interdictions of their own contriving.`
- `And they declare that it is forbidden to burden the backs of certain cattle, and these are the cattle over which they do not pronounce the name of Allah.`
- `All these are false fabrications against Allah,`
- `and He will soon requite them for all that they fabricate.`

## Ayat 139

- `And they say:`
  - `'What is within the bellies of such-and-such cattle is exclusively for our males and is forbidden to our females;`
  - `but if it be born dead, they all may share in it.'`
- `He will soon requite them for all that they (falsely) attribute to Allah.`
- **`He is All-Wise, All-Knowing.`**


## Ayat 140

- `Those who slayed their children in folly, without knowledge,`
- `and forbade the sustenance that Allah has provided them,`
- `falsely ascribing that to Allah,`
- **`are utter losers;`**
- **`they have gone astray, and are certainly not among those guided to the right way.`**
