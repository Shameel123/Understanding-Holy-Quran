**Ayat 91 - 94**

## Ayat 91

- `They did not form any proper estimate of Allah when they said:`
  - `'Allah has not revealed anything to any man.'`
- `Ask them:`
  - `'The Book which Moses brought as a light and guidance for men and which you keep in bits and scraps,`
  - **`some of which you disclose while the rest you conceal,`**
  - `even though through it you were taught that which neither you nor your forefathers knew`
  - **`-who was it who revealed it?'`**
- `Say:`
  - **`'Allah!'`**`-`
- `and then leave them to sport with their argumentation.`

## Ayat 92

- `(Like that Book)`
- `this too is a Book which We have revealed;`
- `full of blessing,`
- `confirming what was revealed before it`
- `so that you might warn the people of the Mother of Cities (Makka)`
- `and those around it.`
- `Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it,`
- `and are evermindful of their Prayers.`

## Ayat 93

- `Who can be more unjust than he who places a lie on Allah and who says:`
  - `'Revelation has come to me'`
- `when in fact nothing was revealed to him,`
- `and who says:`
  - `'I will produce the like of what Allah has revealed?'`
- `If you could but see the wrongdoers in the agonies of death, and the angels stretching out their hands (saying):`
  - **`'Yield up your souls! Today you will be recompensed with the chastisement of humiliation for the lie you spoke concerning Allah, and for you waxing proud against His signs.'`**

## Ayat 94

- `(And Allah will say):`
  - `'Now you have come to Us all alone even as We had created you in the first instance,`
  - `and you have left behind all that We had bestowed upon you in the world.`
  - `We do not see with you your intercessors whom you imagined to have a share with Allah in your affairs.`
  - `You have now been cut off from one another`
  - `and all those whom you imagined (to be Allah's associates in your affairs) have failed you.'`
