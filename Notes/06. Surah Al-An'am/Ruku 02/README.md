**Ayat 11 -20**

## Ayat 11

- `Say:`
  - `'Go about journeying the earth, and behold the end of those who gave the lie (to the Truth).'`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The archaeological remains and historical records of the ancient nations testify to how they met their tragic ends through turning away from truth and honesty and stubbornly persisting in their devotion to falsehood.

## Ayat 12
- `Ask thern:`
  - `'To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth?'1`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The subtlety of this expression should not go unnoticed.
      - The unbelievers are asked to whom belongs whatever exists in either the heavens or on the earth.
      - The inquirer then pauses to wait for the answer.
      - Those questioned are themselves convinced that all belongs to God, yet while they dare not respond falsely, they are nevertheless not prepared to give the correct answer.
      - Fearing that their response may be used as an argument against their polytheistic beliefs, they keep quiet.
      - At this, the inquirer is told to answer the question himself and to say that all belongs to God.
  - `Say:`
    - **`'Everything belongs to Allah.'`**
  - `He has bound Himself to the exercise of mercy (and thus does not chastise you for your disobedience and excesses instantly).`
  - `Surely He will gather you all together on the Day of Resurrection - the coming of which is beyond doubt;`
  - `but those who have courted their own ruin are not going to believe.`


## Ayat 13

- **`And to Him belongs all that dwells in the night and the day.`**
- **`He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.`**

## Ayat 14

- `Say:`
  - `'Shall I take for my guardian anyone other than Allah - the Originator of the heavens and earth;`
  - `He Who feeds and Himself is not fed?'1`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This remark contains a subtle sarcasm.
      - Far from providing sustenance to their followers, the beings whom the polytheists set up as deities beside the true God were dependent upon them for their sustenance.
      - No Pharaoh can maintain the pomp and splendour connected with his godhead unless his subjects pay their tax dues and make him other offerings.
      - No deity can attract worshippers unless some of its devotees make an idol, place it in some magnificent temple, and decorate it lavishly.
      - **All these counterfeit gods are totally dependent upon their own servants.**
      - It is the Lord of the Universe alone Who is the True God, Whose godhead rests solely upon His own power;
      - Who needs the help of no one, whereas no one can dispense with His.
- `Say:`
  - `'Surely I have been commanded to be the first among those who submit (to Allah) and not to be one of those who associate others with Allah in His divinity (even though others may do so).'`

## Ayat 15

- `Say:`
  - `'Surely do I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the chastisement of an awesome Day.`

## Ayat 16

- **`Whosoever has been spared chastisement on that Day,`**
- **`Allah has bestowed His mercy upon him.`**
- **`That is the manifest triumph.`**

Note: We will only be prevented from Hellfire by the Mercy of Allah SWT, not by our own deeds.
May Allah shower His Mercy here as well as on the Last Day. Ameen!


## Ayat 17

- `Should Allah touch you with affliction,`
  - `there is none to remove it but He;`
- `and should He touch you with good,`
  - `He has the power to do everything.`

## Ayat 18

- **`He has the supreme hold over His servants.`**
- **`He is All-Wise, All-Aware.`**

## Ayat 19

- `Ask them:`
  - `'Whose testimony is the greatest?'`
- `Say:`
  - `'Allah is the witness between me and you;`
  - `and this Qur'an was revealed to me that I should warn you thereby and also whomsoever it may reach.'`
- `Do you indeed testify that there are other gods with Allah?`
- `Say:`
  - `'I shall never testify such a thing.'`
- `Say:`
  - `'He is the One God and I am altogether averse to all that you associate with Him in His divinity.'`


## Ayat 20

- `Those whom We have given the Book will recognize this just as they recognize their own ofspring;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Those who have knowledge of the Scriptures know for sure that God is One alone and that no one shares His godhead with Him.
    - It is true that one can spot one's own child even in the midst of a large crowd of children.
    - The same can be said about those well-versed in the Scriptures.
    - Even if the true concept of godhead were interspersed among numerous false beliefs and concepts about God, those well-versed in the scriptural lore would be able to recognize without doubt which doctrine was true.
- `but those who have courted their own ruin will not believe.`
