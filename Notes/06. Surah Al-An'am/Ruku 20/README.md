**Ayat 155 - 165**

## Ayat 155

- `And likewise We revealed this (Book) - a blessed one.`
- `Follow it, then, and become God-fearing;`
- `you may be shown mercy.`

## Ayat 156

- `(You may no longer) say now that the Book was revealed only to two groups of people before Us`
- `and that we had indeed been unaware of what they read.`

This could be directed towards us as we mostly read the Holy Quran that it was revealed for the people who were before us and mostly go through it as it does not concern us.

## Ayat 157

- `Nor may you claim that:`
  - `'Had the Book been revealed to us, we would have been better guided than they.'`
  - **`Surely clear evidence has come to you from your Lord, which is both a guidance and a mercy.`**
  - **`Who, then, is more unjust than he who gave the lie to the signs of Allah and turned away from them?`**
  - `And We shall soon requite those who turn away from Our signs with a severe chastisement for having turned away.`

## Ayat 158

- `What!`
- `Do they wait either for the angels to appear before them or for your Lord to come unto them or for some clear signs of your Lord to appear before them?`
- **`When some clear signs of your Lord will appear, believing will be of no avail to anyone who did not believe before, or who earned no good deeds through his faith.`**
- `Say:`
  - `'Wait on; we too are waiting.'`


## Ayat 159

- **`Surely you have nothing to do with those who have made divisions in their religion and become factions.`**
- `Their matter is with Allah and He will indeed tell them (in time) what they have been doing.`

## Ayat 160

- `Whoever will come to Allah with a good deed shall have ten times as much,`
- `and whoever will come to Allah with an evil deed, shall be requited with no more than the like of it.`
- `They shall not be wronged.`


## Ayat 161

- `Say:`
  - `'As for me, my Lord has guided me on to a straight way, a right religion,`
  - `the way of Abraham who adopted it in exclusive devotion to Allah,`
  - `and he was not of those who associated others with Allah in His divinity.'`

## Ayat 162

- `Say:`
  - `'Surely my Prayer, all my acts of worship, and my living and my dying are for Allah alone, the Lord of the whole universe.`

## Ayat 163

- `He has no associate.`
- `Thus have I been bidden, and I am the foremost of those who submit themselves (to Allah).`


## Ayat 164

- `Say:`
  - `'Shall I seek someone other than Allah as Lord when He is the Lord of everything?'`
  - `Everyone will bear the consequence of what he does,`
  - `and no one shall bear the burden of another.`
  - `Thereafter, your return will be to your Lord, whereupon He will let you know what you disagreed about.`


## Ayat 165

- `For He it is Who has appointed you vicegerent over the earth,`
- `and has exalted some of you over others in rank that He may try you in what He has bestowed is upon you.`
- `Indeed your Lord is swift in retribution, and He is certainly AllForgiving, All-Compassionate.`
