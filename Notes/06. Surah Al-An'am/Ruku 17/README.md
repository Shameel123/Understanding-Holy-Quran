- `and the palm trees,`
- `and crops,`
- `all varying in taste,`
- `and the olive`
- `and pomegranates,`
- `all resembling one another and yet so different.`
- **`Eat of their fruits when they come to fruition and pay His due on the day of harvesting.`**
- `And do not exceed the proper limits,`
- `for He does not love those who exceed the proper limits.`


## Ayat 142

- `some for burden,`
- `and some whose flesh you eat`
- `and whose skins and hair you use to spread the ground.`
- **`Eat of the sustenance Allah has provided you`**
- **`and do not follow in the footsteps of Satan,`**

## Ayat 143

 - `These are eight couples,`
 - `two of sheep,`
 - `two of goats.`
 - `Now ask them:`
   - `'Is it either the two males that Allah has forbidden or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females may contain?`
   - `Tell me about this on the basis of sure knowledge, if you speak the truth.'`

## Ayat 144

- `And likewise,`
- `of camels there are two,`
- `and of oxen there are two.`
- `Ask them:`
  - `'Is it either the two males that He has forbidden or the two females, or that which the wombs of the two females may contain?`
  - `Or were you present when Allah enjoined this commandment upon you?'`
- `Who, then, would be more unjust than he who fabricates a lie against Allah that he might lead people astray without knowledge.`
- **`Surely Allah never guides such a wrong-doing folk.`**

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Questions as to whether the male offspring is lawful and the female is unlawful are presented in some detail to show how unreasonable their superstitions are.
  - That the male offspring of an animal should be considered lawful for eating while the female be prohibited, or vice versa;
  - and that an animal should itself be considered lawful, but not its offspring, is so manifestly unreasonable that common sense simply refuses to accept it, and no intelligent man can ever conceive such absurdities to have been sanctioned by God. Just as the superstitions in vogue among the Arabs were absurd, as the Qur'an stresses, likewise many other nations of the world follow even now irrational dietary restrictions, and believe that food and drink become polluted merely by the touch of some other people.
