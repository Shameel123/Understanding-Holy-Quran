**Ayat 111 - 121**

## Ayat 111


- `Even if We had sent angels down to them`
- `and the dead had spoken to them,`
- `and even if We had assembled before them all the things, face to face,`
- **`they would still not believe`**
- **`unless it be Allah's will that they believe.`**
- `Most of them behave in utter ignorance.`

## Ayat 112

- `And so it is that against every Prophet We have set up the evil ones from among men and jinn,`
- `some of them inspire others with specious speech only by way of delusion.`
- **`Had it been your Lord's will, they would not have done it.`**
- `Leave them alone to fabricate what they will.`

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Prophet (peace be on him) is told that he should not be unnerved even if the evil ones among both mankind and the jinn stood united against him and opposed him with all their might. For this was not the first time that such a thing had happened. Whenever a Prophet came and tried to lead people to the Truth, all the satanic forces joined hands to defeat his mission.
  - 'Specious talk' signifies all the trickery and manoeuvring to which the enemy resorts, all his efforts aimed at sowing doubts about Islam and undermining people's faith in it, so as to arouse them against both the Prophet (peace be on him) and his message.
  - Taken as a whole, these are characterized as 'delusion', for the weapons used in their crusade by the opponents of the Truth have the effect of deluding others as well as themselves, no matter how beneficial and successful those weapons may appear to be.

## Ayat 113

- `So that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Life to Come might incline towards this attractive delusion,`
- `and that they may be well pleased with it and might acquire the evils that they are bent on acquiring.`

## Ayat 114

- `Shall I look upon anyone apart from Allah for judgement when it is He Who has revealed to you the Book in detail?`
- `And those whom We gave the Book (before you) know that this (Book) has been revealed in truth by your Lord.`
- **`Do not, then, be among the doubters.`**

## Ayat 115

- **`The Word of your Lord is perfect in truthfulness and justice;`**
- **`no one can change His words.`**
- **`He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.`**

## Ayat 116

- `(O Muhammad!)`
- `If you obey the majority of those who live on earth,`
- `they will lead you away from Allah's path.`
- `They only follow idle fancies, indulging in conjecture.`

## Ayat 117

- **`And your - Lord knows well who stray from His path, and also those who are rightly-guided.`**

## Ayat 118

## Bayan-ul-Quran

`پس کھاؤ ان چیزوں میں سے جن پر اللہ کا نام لیا گیا ہے اگر تم اس کی آیات پر ایمان رکھتے ہو`


## Ayat 119

- `And how is it that you do not eat of that over which Allah's name has been pronounced even though He has clearly spelled out to you what He has forbidden you unless you are constrained to it?`
- `Many indeed say misleading things without knowledge, driven merely by their lowly desires.`
- `But your Lord knows well the transgressors.`

## Ayat 120

- `Abstain from sin, be it either open or secret.`
- `Indeed those who commit sins shall surely be requited for all they have done.`

## Ayat 121

- `Do not eat of (the animal) over which the name of Allah has not been pronounced (at the time of its slaughtering), for that is a transgression.`
- `And behold, the evil ones do inspire doubts and objections into the hearts of their friends so that they dispute with you;`
- `but if you obey them, you will surely yourselves turn into those who associate others with Allah in His divinity.`
