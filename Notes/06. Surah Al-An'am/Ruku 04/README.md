**Ayat 31 -41**

## Ayat 31

- `Those who consider it a lie that they will have to meet Allah are indeed the losers`
- `so much so that when that Hour comes to them suddenly they will say:`
  - `'Alas for us, how negligent we have been in this behalf.'`
- `They will carry their burden (of sins) on their backs.`
- `How evil is the burden they bear!`

## Ayat 32

- `The life of this world is nothing but a sport and a pastime,`
- `and the life of the Hereafter is far better for those who seek to ward off their ruin.`
- `Will you not, then, understand?`

## Ayat 33

- `(O Muhammad!)`
- `We know indeed that the things they say grieve you,`
- `though in truth it is not you whom they give the lie to,`
- `but it is the signs of Allah that these wrong-doers reject.`

Tahfim-ul-Quran:
- The fact is that before the Prophet Muhammad (peace be on him) began to preach the message of God, all his people regarded him as truthful and trustworthy and had full confidence in his veracity.
- Only after he had begun to preach the message of God did they call him a liar. Even during this period none dared to say that the Prophet (peace be on him) had ever been guilty of untruthfullness in personal matters.
- Even his worst enemies never accused him of lying in any worldly affairs.
- When they did accuse him of falsehood, they did so in respect of his prophetic mission.
- Abu Jahl for instance, was one of his staunchest enemies.
- According to a tradition from 'Ali, Abu Jahl once said to the Prophet (peace be on him): **'We do not disbelieve you. We disbelieve your message.'**
- On the occasion of the Battle of Badr, Akhnas b. Shariq asked Abu Jahl, when they were alone, to confide whether he considered Muhammad to be truthful or not. He replied: **' By God, Muhammad is a veracious person. He has never lied in all his life. But if every honorable office-liwa' (standard-bearing in war), siqayah ( provision of water to the pilgrims), hijabah (gaurdian ship of the ka'bah ) and nubuwah ( prophethood ) - were to fall to the share of the decendents of Qusayy, what would be left for the rest of the Quraysh?'** (Ibn Kathir,vol.3, pp.17-18-Ed.)
- Here God consoled the Prophet(peace be on him) by telling him that by charging him with falsehood the unbelievers were calling God untruthful. Since God has endured this accusation with mild forbearance, leaving them free to persist in their blasphemy, the Prophet ( peace be on him ) need not feel undue disquiet.


## Ayat 34

- `Messengers before you have been given the lie to,`
- `and they endured with patience their being given the lie to and being persecuted until the time when Our help reached them.`
- `None has the power to alter the words of Allah.`
- `Indeed some account of the Messengers has already reached you.`


## Ayat 35

- `Nevertheless, if their turning away grieves you, then seek - if you can - either a way down into the earth or a ladder to the heavens, and try to bring to them some sign.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Prophet (peace be on him) saw that even though he had spent a long time admonishing his people, they did not seem inclined to heed his call. As a result he sometimes wished for the appearance of some extraordinary sign of God that would undermine the stubbornness of his people and lead them to accept his guidance.
    - This verse embodies God's response to the Prophet's desire. He is told not to be impatient. He must persist in his striving and continue to work. in conformity with God's directive. Had it been God's purpose to work miracles, He would have done so. But God did not consider that to be either the appropriate method for bringing to a successful completion the required intellectual and moral revolution or for the evolution of a sound, healthy civilization. Well, then, if the Prophet (peace be on him) could not bear patiently with the attitude of stubbornness and rejection prevalent among his people, and if he thought it necessary to make them witness a tangible sign of God, let him muster all his strength and try to cleave the earth, or climb a ladder to the heaven and bring forth a miracle powerful enough to change the unbelief of the unbelievers into belief. He is told, however, that in this regard he should not expect God to fulfil his wish, for such things have no place in God's scheme.
- `Had Allah so willed, He would have gathered them all to the true guidance. Do not, then, be among the ignorant.`


## Ayat 36

- `Only they who listen can respond to the call of the Truth;`
- `as for the dead, Allah will raise them and then to Him they will be returned.`

  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - 'Those who hear' refers to those whose consciences are alive, who have not atrophied their intellect and reason, and who have not closed their hearts to the Truth out of irrational prejudice and menta! inflexibility.
    - In contrast to such people are those who are characterized as 'dead' - who blindly follow the old familiar beaten tracks, and can never deviate from the ways they have inherited, even when these ways are plainly at variance with the Truth.


## Ayat 37

- `And they say:`
  - `'Why has no miraculous sign been sent down to him from his Lord?'`
- `Say:`
  - `'Surely Allah has the power to send down a sign, but most of them do not know.`


## Ayat 38

- `There is no animal that crawls on the earth,`
- `no bird that flies with its two wings,`
- `but are communities like you.`
- `We have neglected nothing in the Book (of decree).`
- `Then to their Lord will they all be mustered.`

## Ayat 39

- `Those who gave the lie to Our signs are deaf and dumb and blunder about in darkness.`
- `Allah causes whomsoever He wills to stray in error,`
- `and sets whomsoever He wills on the straight way.'` 


## Ayat 40

- `Say:`
  - `'What do you think if some chastisement of Allah or the Hour suddenly overtakes you:`
    - `do you cry to any other than Allah? Answer, if you speak the truth.`


 ## Ayat 41

 - `Lo, it is to Him alone that you cry and then, if He so wills, He removes the distress for which you had cried to Him.`
 - `Then you forget the partners you had set up with Allah.`
