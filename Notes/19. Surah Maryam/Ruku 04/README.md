**Ayat  51 - 65**

## Ayat 51

- `And recite in the Book the account of Moses.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word used is mukhlasan, which means purified. In other words, Allah had specially chosen Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) for the mission of Prophethood.
- `He was a chosen one, a Messenger, a Prophet.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Rasul literally means the one who is sent; therefore it is used for an ambassador, envoy, messenger and representative.
    - The Quran has used this title for angels, who are sent by Allah on a special mission, or for the human beings who brought His Message to mankind.

## Ayat 52

- `We called out to him from the right side of the Mount,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “The right side of the Mount” means the eastern side of the mountain.
    - As Prophet Moses (peace be upon him), on his way from Midian to Egypt, was passing from the southern side of Mountt Toor, the eastern side would lie on his right and the western on his left if he faced the mountain, otherwise a mountain by itself cannot have a right or a left side.
- `and We drew him near to Us by communing to him in secret,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quan:
    - See( E.N. 206 of Surah An-Nisa).

## Ayat 53

- `and out of Our mercy We appointed his brother Aaron, a Prophet (that he may assist him).`

## Ayat 54

- `And recite in the Book the account of Ishmael.`
- `He was ever true to his promise, and was a Messenger, a Prophet.`

## Ayat 55

- `He enjoined his household to observe Prayer and to give Zakah (purifying alms);`
- `and his Lord was well pleased with him.`

## Ayat 56

- `And recite in the Book the account of Idris.`
- `He was a man of truth, a Prophet;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quan:
  - There is a difference of opinion as to who Prophet Idris (peace be upon him) was. 
  - Some commentators opine that he was a Prophet from among the Israelites, but the majority of them are inclined to the view that he was a Prophet before Noah (peace be upon him).
  - There is no authentic tradition which may help determine his identity.
  - The next (verse 58), however, supports the view that he appeared before Prophet Noah (peace be upon him).
  - For of all the Prophets mentioned, he alone was the one who may be said to be from the descendants of Adam.

## Ayat 57

- `and We exalted him to a lofty position.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The plain meaning is that God had favored Idris with a high rank, but according to the Israelite traditions, God took up Idris (Enoch) to heavens.
  - The Bible says: And he was not; for God took him, but the Talmud has a long story to tell, which ends with the words: Enoch ascended to heaven in a whirlwind, with chariot and horses of fire.

## Ayat 58

- `These are the Prophets upon whom Allah bestowed His favour`
  - `from the seed of Adam,`
  - `and from the seed of those whom We carried (in the Ark) with Noah,`
  - `and from the seed of Abraham and Israel.`
- `They were those whom We guided and chose (for an exalted position).`
- **`They were such that when the words of the Most Compassionate Lord were recited to them, they fell down in prostration, weeping.`**
  - **Sajdah**

## Ayat 59

- `They were succeeded by a people who neglected the Prayers`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It appears that the degenerate people totally discarded Salat, or they had become neglectful and careless in its observance.
    - This is the first evil that is committed by a degenerate people.
    - For, after this there remains no connection whatever between them and God. Here it has been stated as a universal principle that the degeneration of the people of all the former Prophets started with the abandonment of Salat by them.
- `and pursued their lusts.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This was the inevitable result of the loss of the connection with Allah.
    - As they became more and more neglectful of their Salat, their lusts took complete hold of them and they fell to the lowest depths of moral depravity and began to follow their whims instead of the divine commands.
- `They shall presently meet with their doom,`

## Ayat 60

- `except those who repent and believe and act righteously.`
- `Such shall enter Paradise and shall not be wronged at all.`

## Ayat 61

- `Theirs shall be everlasting Gardens which the Most Compassionate Lord has promised His servants in a realm which is beyond the ken of perception.`
- `Surely His promise shall he fulfilled.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the promised gardens which are yet unseen by His servants.

## Ayat 62

- `They shall not hear in it anything vain;`
- `they shall hear only what is good;1`
- `and they shall have their provision in it, morning and evening.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The word used is salam, which means free from defect and fault.
  - It implies to mean that the greatest blessing that man will enjoy in Paradise will be that there he will hear no idle, vile or indecent talk.
  - All the dwellers of Paradise will be neat and clean and pure people and every individual will be gentle and right minded by nature.
  - Everybody will be secure against backbiting, slander and indecent songs and other ugly sounds. Whatever men will hear will be good, sensible and right.

## Ayat 63

- `Such is the Paradise which We shall cause those of Our servants who have been God-fearing to inherit.`

## Ayat 64

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This paragraph is a parenthesis, which has been inserted at the end of one theme and before the commencement of the other.
  - It is obvious from this that this Surah was sent down after a long delay.
  - At that time the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his companions were passing through very hard times and were always expecting a revelation to guide and comfort them.
  - When Angel Gabriel came with other angels with this revelation, he at first delivered that part of the message which was immediately needed.
  - Then before proceeding further, he said these words by the leave of Allah as an explanation for the delay and to give them comfort from Allah and counsel of fortitude.
  - This interpretation is not only borne out by the wording of the passage but also by some traditions of the Prophet (peace be upon him), which have been cited by Ibn Jarir, Ibn Kathir, and the author of Ruh-ul-Maani in their commentary on this passage.

- `(The angels will say):`
  - `"(O Muhammad!) We descend not except by the command of your Lord.`
  - `To Him belongs`
    - `all that is before us and`
    - `all that is behind us, and`
    - `all that is in between.`
  - `Your Lord is not forgetful in the least.`

## Ayat 65

- `He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is in between.`
- `Serve Him, then,`
- `and be constant in serving Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you should not only follow strictly the way of service and face all the obstacles and afflictions with patience, but also should not get uneasy, if there is a delay in revelation and help.
    - You should rest content with His service as an obedient servant and perform persistently the duties and responsibilities entrusted to you as a servant and Messenger.
- `Do you know anyone that might be His compeer?"`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word Samiya literally means a name sake. Here it implies: Allah is the only Deity. Do you know of any other deity besides Him? If there is none, and you know that there is none, then you do not have any alternative but to serve Him and obey His commands.
