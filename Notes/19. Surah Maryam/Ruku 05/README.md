**Ayat  66 - 82**

## Ayat 66

- `Man is prone to say:`
  - `"Shall I be raised to life after I die?"`

## Ayat 67

- `Does man not remember that We created him before when he was nothing?`

## Ayat 68

- `By your Lord,`
- `We will surely muster them and the devils together.`
- `Then We will surely bring them all, on their knees, around Hell,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Satans are the leaders who persuade the wicked people to enjoy themselves in this worldly life, for there is no life in the Hereafter, where they shall have to present themselves before Allah and give an account of their deeds.

## Ayat 69

- `and then We will draw aside from each party those who were most rebellious against the Most Compassionate Lord,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The leader of every rebel band.

## Ayat 70

- `and then We shall know well all those most worthy to be cast in Hell.`

## Ayat 71

- `There is not one of you but shall pass by Hell.`
- `This is a decree which your Lord will fulfil.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - According to some traditions, **“pass over it (Hell)”** means to enter Hell, but none of these traditions is authentic.
  - Then this interpretation goes against the Quran and a great many authentic traditions, which clearly state that the true believers will never be cast into Hell. 
  - Lexically also, variduha (being presented unto) is not synonymous with dukhul (causing to enter).
  - Therefore, the correct meaning would be that every human being will be presented before Hell, but then, as the next verse clarifies, the pious people will be rescued and the transgressors left therein on their knees.

## Ayat 72

- `Then We shall deliver those that feared Allah and leave the wrong-doers there on their knees.`

## Ayat 73

- `When Our clear revelations are recited to those who deny the Truth they are wont to say to those who have faith:`
  - `"Which of the two groups has a better status and whose assemblies are grander?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In response to the recital of clear revelations, instead of accepting their message, the unbelievers put such questions as these to the believers to show that they were in the right:
    - Who has grander houses to live in?
    - Who has a higher standard of life?
    - Who enjoys splendid meetings?
    - If we are enjoying all these things while you are deprived of them, you may decide for yourselves whether we, who are enjoying happy worldly lives, are in the wrong, or you who are living miserable lives of indigence are in the right?
  - Also see (Surah Al-Kahf E.Ns 37-38). 7

## Ayat 74

- `How numerous are the peoples We destroyed before them`
- `- those that were more resourceful and grander in outward appearance!`

## Ayat 75

- `Say:`
  - `"The Most Compassionate Lord grants respite to those who stray into error,`
  - `until they behold what they had been threatened with,`
  - `either God's chastisement (in the world) or the Hour (of Resurrection)" -`
  - `then they fully know whose station is worse, and who is weaker in hosts!`

## Ayat 76

- `(On the contrary), Allah increases in guidance those who follow the Right Way.`
- `Lasting acts of righteousness are better in the sight of your Lord as reward and conducive to a better end.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, On every critical occasion, Allah guides them to make right decisions and helps them to adopt the right way, and protects them from evil and wrong things; thus they go on making more and more progress on the right way.

## Ayat 77

- `Have you seen him who rejected Our signs and said:`
  - `"Surely I shall continue to be favoured with riches and children."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quarn:
  - The boastful person was not a particular man but a typical chief of the disbelievers of Makkah.
  - Everyone of them claimed: Howsoever you may call me an erroneous and un-righteous person and threaten me with the divine scourge, the fact is that I am more prosperous than you today and shall continue being blessed with favors in future as well.
  - Just have a look at my riches, at my grandeur and at my estate, and at my well-known sons, and then say where you see any signs of the wrath of God.


## Ayat 78

- `Has he obtained knowledge of the Unseen,`
- `or has he taken a covenant with the Most Compassionate Lord?`

## Ayat 79

- `By no means!`
- `We shall write down all what he says;`
- `and We shall greatly prolong his chastisement,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the boastful words of his shall also be included in the record of his crimes and he shall have to bear the consequences of his arrogant claim.

## Ayat 80

- `and We shall inherit all the resources and hosts of which he boasts,`
- `and he will come to Us all alone.`

## Ayat 81

- `They have taken other gods instead of Allah that they may be a source of strength for them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Arabic word Izzan (from Izat) implies a powerful and strong person whom nobody may dare do any harm;
  - here it means a person’s having such a strong supporter that no enemy or opponent of his may even cherish an evil intention against him.


## Ayat 82

- `By no means!`
- `They shall soon deny their worship`
- `and shall become their adversaries instead.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, they will say: We never asked them to worship us nor were we aware that these foolish people were worshiping us.
