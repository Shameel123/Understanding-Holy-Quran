**Ayat  21 - 34**


## Ayat 21

- `Those who do not look forward to meet Us say:`
  - `"Why should angels not be sent to us,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, if Allah had really intended to convey His message to us, He would not have chosen a prophet and sent an angel only to him, but to each one of us individually with the guidance, or He should have sent a deputation of angels to appear before the people with the message.
      - The same objection has been stated in **Surah Al-Anaam** thus: 
        - **When a revelation comes before them, they say: We will not believe in it unless we are given the like of what has been given to the Messengers of Allah. Allah knows best whom to entrust with His mission and how it should be enforced.** 
          - (verse 124).
  - `or why do we ourselves not observe our Lord?"`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, Allah Himself should appear before us and make the appeal.
- `Surely they are too proud of themselves`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Another translation could be: They have formed a very high opinion of their own selves.
- `and have gone beyond all limits in their rebellion.`

## Ayat 22

- `On that Day - the Day when they will behold angels - there will be no good news for those immersed in evil, and they will cry out:`
  - `"We seek refuge (in Allah)."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This very theme has been expressed in much greater detail in (Al-Anaam, Ayat 8); (Surah Al-Hijr, Ayats 7-8 and 51-64); and in (Surah BaniIsrail, Ayats 90-95)

## Ayat 23

- `And We shall turn to their deeds and shall reduce them to scattered dust.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For explanation, see(Surah Ibrahim, Ayat 18 and E.Ns 25, 26) thereof.

## Ayat 24

- `On that Day it is the inmates of Paradise that will be graced with a better abode and a fairer resting place.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In contrast to the miserable plight of the disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection, the believers will be protected from the hardships of that Day. They will be treated with honor and will have a blissful place for midday rest.
  - **According to a tradition, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: I declare on oath by Allah, in Whose hand is my life, that the long, horrible Day of Resurrection will be made very short and light for a believer, as short and light as the time taken in offering an obligatory Prayer.** (Musnad Ahmad).


## Ayat 25

- `On that Day the sky shall be rent asunder by a cloud and a whole cavalcade of angels will be made to descend.`

## Ayat 26

- **`On that Day the true kingdom will belong only to the Merciful Lord.`**
- **`That will be a hard day for those that deny the Truth;`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, on that Day all other kingdoms, which deluded man in the world, will come to an end, and there will be only the Kingdom of Allah, Who is the real Sovereign of the universe.
  - In (Surah Momin, Ayat 16), the same thing has been stated thus:
    - **On that Day when all the people will stand exposed, and nothing of them will be hidden from Allah, it will be asked: Whose is the Sovereignty today? The response from every side will be: Of Allah, the Almighty.**
  - According to a tradition, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 
    - **Allah will take the heavens in one hand and the earth in the other, and will declare: I am the Sovereign: I am the Ruler. Where are the other rulers of the earth? Where are those tyrants? Where are the arrogant people?** (Musnad Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, and Abu Daud, with slight variations). 

## Ayat 27

- `a Day when the wrong-doer will bite his hands, saying:`
  - **`"Would that I had stood by the Messenger!`**

## Ayat 28

- **`Woe is me! Would that I had not taken such a one for a friend!`**

## Ayat 29

- `He led me astray from the Admonition that had come to me.`
- `Satan proved to be a great betrayer of man."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Satan has proved very treacherous to man. It may also be a part of the disbelieversâ€™ lament, or it may be a remark by Allah, in which case the meaning will be: And Satan is indeed the one who always deceives man.

## Ayat 30

- `And the Messenger will say:`
  - `"My Lord! My own people had made this Qur'an an object of laughter."`



- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Arabic word mahjur is capable of several meanings.
  - As such, the sentence may mean: these people did not regard the Quran as worthy of their consideration: they neither accepted it nor followed it. Or they considered it to be nonsense or the delirium of insanity. Or they made it the target of their ridicule and mockery.


## Ayat 31

- `(O Muhammad), thus did We make for every Prophet enemies from among those immersed in evil.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, it is not a new thing that the disbelievers have become your enemies, for it has always been so with all the former Prophets and Messengers.
      - See also (Surah Al- Anaam, Ayats 112-113).
      - This is inevitable because it is Our Law that the criminals will always oppose the truth. You should, therefore, pursue your mission with full confidence and determination without expecting any immediate results.
- `Your Lord suffices you as a Guide and a Helper.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Guidance does not only imply bestowing of the knowledge of the truth, but it also means giving the right guidance at the right time to guide the Islamic movement on the right lines and to defeat the strategy and scheme of the enemies of Islam.
      - Help means all kinds of moral, spiritual and material help to the followers of the truth in their conflict against falsehood. 
      - Thus, Allah is All Sufficient for the righteous people and they need no other support provided they have full faith in Allah and fight falsehood with all their energies and strength.

## Ayat 32

- `Those who disbelieve say:`
  - `"Why was the Qur'an not revealed to him all at once?"`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - As the disbelievers of Makkah considered this objection to be very strong, they repeated it over and over again. The Quran also has cited it with its answer at several places. For instance, see (E.Ns 101-106 of Surah An-Naml) and(E.N. 119 of Surah Bani Israil).
      - Their question implied: Had the Quran been really the Word of Allah, it would have been sent as a complete book all at once; for Allah has the knowledge of everything and every human affair. Thus it is obvious that nothing is being sent down from above; but this man himself fabricates all its themes or gets these from other people or other books.
- `It was revealed thus that We may fully impress it on your mind;`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - So that by it We may strengthen your heart and imbue it with courage. The words are comprehensive. This concise sentence contains the following explanation why the Quran was revealed piecemeal by degrees:
- `(and for the same end) We have revealed it gradually (according to a scheme) in fragments.`

## Ayat 33

- `(This was also done so that) whenever they put any strange question to you, We sent its right answer and explained the matter in the best manner.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is yet another point of wisdom of sending down the Quran by degrees.
  - Allah did not intend to produce a book on guidance and spread its teachings through the agency of His Prophet (peace be upon him).
  - Had it been so the disbelievers would have been justified in their objection as to why the Quran had not been sent down as a complete book all at once.
  - The real object of the revelation of the Quran was that Allah intended to start a movement of faith, piety and righteousness to combat disbelief, ignorance and sin, and He had raised a Prophet to lead and guide the movement.
  - Then, on the one hand, Allah had taken it upon Himself to send necessary instructions and guidance to the leader and his followers as and when needed, and on the other, He had also taken the responsibility to answer the objections and remove the doubts of opponents and give the right interpretation of things which they misunderstood.
  - Thus the Quran was the collection of the different discourses that were being revealed by Allah; it was not merely meant to be a code of laws or of moral principles, but a Book, which was being sent down piecemeal to guide the movement in all its stages to suit its requirements on different occasions.

## Ayat 34

- `Those who shall be mustered in the Hell upon their faces,`
- `their stand is the worst and their way most erroneous.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, they will be driven towards Hell upon their faces because of their perversion and their perverted thinking.
