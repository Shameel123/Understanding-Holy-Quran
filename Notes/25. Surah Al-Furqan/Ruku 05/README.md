**Ayat  45 - 60**

## Ayat 45

- `Have you not seen how your Lord spreads the shade? If He will, He could have made it stationary; instead, We have made the sun its pilot.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The word dalil has been used in the sense of the pilot, who is a person trained to take ships safely in or out of a harbor, or along a waterway. The sun has been made the pilot of the shadow because the lengthening out of the shadow and its being rolled up depends on the rising, declining and setting of the sun.

## Ayat 46

- `So (as the sun rises), We gradually roll up that shade unto Us.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - We annihilate it or cause it to disappear, for everything which is annihilated returns to Allah, because everything comes from Him and returns to Him.

## Ayat 47

- `It is Allah Who has made night a garment for you,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The night is a garment in the sense that it covers and hides things.
- `and sleep the repose (of death),`
- `and has made day the time of rising to life.`

## Ayat 48

- `And He it is Who sends forth the winds as glad tidings, heralding His Mercy.`
- `Then We send down pure water1 from the sky`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, such water as is pure and free from all sorts of impurities, germs and poison, which cleanses and washes away filth and becomes a source of life for men, beasts as well as all kinds of plant life.


## Ayat 49

- `that We may revive through it a dead land and give it for drink to many cattle and human beings from among Our creation.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse also gives proofs of the doctrine of Tauhid and the Hereafter. Besides, it contains a subtle suggestion that the period of the drought of ignorance has been replaced through Allah’s mercy by the blessed rain of Prophethood, which is showering the life giving knowledge of revelation from which many servants of Allah will certainly benefit, if not all.

## Ayat 50

- `We present this wondrous phenomenon to them over and over again`
- `that they may learn a lesson from it.`
- `But most people simply decline everything except disbelief and ingratitude.`
  
## Ayat 51

- `Had We so willed,`
- `We would have raised up in every town a warner.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, if We had willed, We could have sent a separate Prophet to every habitation but We did not do so, because like the sun, Our Last Prophet suffices to enlighten the entire world.

## Ayat 52

- `So, (O Prophet), do not follow the unbelievers but engage in a mighty striving against them with this Qur'an.`

## Ayat 53

- `And He it is Who has joined the two seas:`
- `one sweet and palatable and the other saltish and bitter;`
- `and He has set a barrier and an insurmountable obstruction between the two that keeps them apart.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This phenomenon has been perceived in many places in the sea and on the land that sweet water and bitter water has existed side by side. 
  - Turkish Admiral Syedi Ali Rais, in his book Mirat-al-Mamalik, written in the 16th century, has mentioned a place in the Persian Gulf, where springs of sweet waver exist under the bitter waters of the sea, where he could get drinking water for his fleet.
  - The American Oil company at first obtained water from the same springs in the Persian Gulf, before they dug up wells near Dhahran for the supply of the drinking water.
  - Near Bahrain also there exist springs of sweet water at the sea bed from which people have been taking water until quite recently. 
  - Besides this apparent meaning which gives a rational proof of Allah’s being the One and the only Lord of the universe, the verse contains a subtle suggestion as well: When Allah wills, He can raise up a righteous community from among a large wicked society just as He can cause springs of palatable and sweet water to gush out from under the salty waters of the sea.

## Ayat 54

- `And He it is Who has created man from water and then produced from him two sorts of kindred: by descent and by marriage.`
- `Your Lord is All-Powerful.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here the miracle of the birth of man from a mere sperm drop and the procreation of his offspring from man and woman have been cited as a proof of Tauhid.
  - Though both man and woman belong to the same genus, they are two species, having important common human characteristics but different physical structures and psychological traits.
  - It is a proof of Tauhid that the All- Powerful Allah has used this difference for making the two as complements and not antagonists.
  - It is also the design of the All-Powerful Creator that He is creating sons and daughters in the world in due proportion Then the sons marry and create blood relationships, and the daughters are married and become means of forming new relationships.
  - This process goes on widening to produce families, tribes and nations belonging to the same race and bound by the same civilization.

## Ayat 55

- `And yet people worship deities other than Allah that can neither benefit them nor hurt them.`
- `Besides, the unbeliever is ever prone to come to the support of everyone who rebels against his Lord.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is a characteristic of the typical disbeliever.
  - He is a helper and defender of all those who are rebels against Allah and an enemy of all those who may he striving to raise Allah’s Word and enforce His Law in the world.
  - He is associated directly or indirectly with all the works of Allah’s disobedience and opposes and resists in one way or the other every effort that is made to bring people to the path of Allah’s obedience and service.

## Ayat 56

- `We have not sent you, (O Muhammad), except as a bearer of good tidings and a warner.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This (verse 56) was meant to comfort the Prophet (peace be upon him) and to warn the disbelievers who opposed him and obstructed his work, as if to say: Your duty is only to convey the message of good news to the people and to warn them of the consequences of disbelief. 
  - You are not responsible as to whether they accept your message or reject it, or to reward the believers and punish the disbelievers.

## Ayat 57

- `Say to them: "I ask of you no reward for my work. My only reward is that whoever so wills may follow the way leading to His Lord."`

## Ayat 58

- **`(O Muhammad), put your trust in Him Who is Ever-Living, Who will never die,`**
- **`and glorify Him with His praise.`**
- **`He suffices as the Knower of the sins of His servants,`**

## Ayat 59

- `He Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is in between them in six days,`
- `and then ascended the Throne;`
- `the Merciful One.`
- `Ask concerning Him the one who knows.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - For explanation of Throne, see (E.Ns 41, 42 of Surah Al- Aaraf); (E.N. 4 of Surah Younus), and (E.N. 7 Surah of Houd).
  - It is difficult to say what exactly is mean by six days.
  - Here a day may mean a period of time or an ordinary day of this world.
  - For explanation of the day, see (E.Ns 11 to 15 of Surah HaMim Sajdah).
 

## Ayat 60

### Sajdah Ayat

- `When they are told:`
  - `"Prostrate yourselves before the Merciful One,"`
- `they say:`
  - `"What is the Merciful One? Shall we prostrate ourselves before whomsoever you command us to prostrate?"`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This they said due to their arrogance and stubbornness just as Pharaoh had said to Prophet Moses: What is the Lord of the universe? For the disbelievers of Makkah were not unaware of the Merciful (Rahman), nor was Pharaoh unaware of the Lord of the universe.
      - The wording of the verse itself shows that their question about the Merciful was not the result of their ignorance of Him but was due to their rebelliousness.
      - Otherwise Allah would not have punished them for this but would have informed them politely that He Himself is Merciful.
      - **Besides this, it is well known historically that the word Rahman (Merciful) for Allah had been in common usage in Arabia since the ancient times.**
      - Please see also (E.N. 5 of Surah As-Sajdah) and (E.N. 35 of Surah Saba).
- `This even further increases their aversion.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - All scholars agree that here a prostration of recital (Sajdah Talawat) has been enjoined, which means that every reader and every hearer must prostrate himself on reciting or hearing the recital of this verse.
      - According to traditions, the one who hears this verse being recited should say:
        - **Zadan Allahu khuduan - aenama - zada liladaai nufura**:
        - **May Allah increase us in humility - even as - the enemies are increased in their hatred.**
