**Ayat 61 - 77**

## Ayat 61

- `Most blessed is He Who set a constellation in the heavens,`
- `and placed in it a great lamp`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the sun, as mentioned clearly in (Surah Nooh, Ayat 16): And made the sun a lamp.
- `and a shining moon.`  

## Ayat 62

- `He it is Who has appointed night and day to succeed one another (as a Sign) for him`
  - `who desires to take heed,`
  - `or desires to be thankful.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The observation and deep consideration of the wonderful phenomenon of the alternation of the day and night is a proof of Tauhid and His Providence so that man may feel grateful to Him and prostrate himself before Him in all humility.

## Ayat 63

- `The true servants of the Merciful One are those`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, though all human beings are by birth the servants of the Merciful before Whom you have been invited to prostrate yourselves, and which you disdain,
    - his true servants are those who adopt the way of His obedience consciously and develop such desirable characteristics.
    - Then the natural consequences of the prostration are those found in the lives of the believers and the evil results of rejecting the invitation, those found in your lives.
    - Here attention is being drawn to the two patterns of character and life. 
      - First of those who had accepted the message of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and were following it,
      - and the second of those who persisted in the ways of ignorance.
  - Here only the prominent characteristics of the true believers have been cited, and for contrast, the characteristics of the disbelievers have been left to every discerning eye and mind which could see them all around in the society and make its own decision.
- `who walk on the earth gently`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is; they do not walk haughtily and arrogantly like the tyrants and mischief-makers, but their gait is of a gentle, right thinking and good natured person.
    - Walking humbly does not mean walking like a weak or sick person, nor does it imply the gait of a hypocrite who walks ostentatiously to show humility or fear of God.
    - **According to traditions, the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself used to walk with firm, quick steps.**
    - *One day Caliph Umar saw a young man walking slowly like a weak, sick person, and asked him: Are you ill? When the man replied in the negative, the Caliph raised his whip, rebuked him and told him to walk like a healthy man.*
    - **This shows that the humble gait is the natural gait of a noble and gentle person and not a gait which shows weakness and undue humility.**
- `and when the foolish ones address them,`
- `they simply say: "Peace to you";`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this connection, the first characteristic of the true servants of Allah to which attention has been drawn, is their gait. This is because the gait indicates the character of an individual.
    - If a man walks in a humble and dignified way, as opposed to a haughty, vain and proud manner, it shows that he is a noble and gentle person.
    - Thus the different gaits of different types of people show what sort of characters they possess.
    - The verse means to imply that the true servants of the Merciful can be easily recognized by their gait among the people.
    - Their attitude of Allah’s worship and obedience has changed them so thoroughly that it can be seen at first sight from their gate that they are noble, humble and good natured people, who cannot be expected to indulge in any mischief.
      - For further explanation, see(E.N.43 of Surah Bani Israil )and(E.N 33 of Surah Luqman).

## Ayat 64

- `who spend the night prostrating themselves before their Lord and standing;`
  
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, they neither spend their nights in fun and merry making nor in gossips and telling tales, nor in doing wicked deeds, for these are the ways of the ignorant people.
  - The true servants of Allah pass their nights in worshipping and remembering Him as much as they can. This characteristic of theirs has been brought out clearly at several places in the Quran, thus: 
  - **Their backs forsake their beds and they invoke their Lord in fear and in hope.** *(Surah As-Sajdah, Ayat 16)*.
  - **These people (of Paradise) slept but little at night, and prayed for their forgiveness in the hours of the morning.** *(Surah Az-Zariyat, Ayats 17, 18)*.
  - And: **Can the end of the one, who is obedient to Allah, prostrates himself and stands before Him during the hours of the night, fears the Hereafter and places his hope in the mercy of his Lord, be like that of a mushrik.** *(Surah Az- Zumar, Ayat 9)*.

## Ayat 65

- `who entreat: "Our Lord! Ward off from us the chastisement of Hell, for its chastisement is one that clings.`

## Ayat 66

- `Verily it is a wretched abode and restingplace."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:  
  - That is, their worship has not made them vain and proud to presume that they are the beloved ones of Allah and that the Fire of Hell will not touch them.
  - On the other hand, in spite of all their worship and good deeds, they are so filled with the fear of the torment of Hell that they pray to their Lord to save them from it, for they do not depend upon their own work for success in the Hereafter but upon the mercy of Allah.

## Ayat 67
- `(The true servants of the Merciful One are) those who are neither extravagant nor niggardly in their spending but keep the golden mean between the two;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:  
  - The true servants of Allah adopt the golden mean between the two extremes in spending their money.
  - They neither go beyond prudence and necessity in expenditure nor live in wretched circumstances in order to save and hoard money but are frugal.
  - This was the characteristic of the followers of the Prophet (peace be upon him), which distinguished them from the well-to-do people of Arabia, who were either spend thrifts in regard to the gratification of their own lusts or niggardly in spending their money on good works.


## Ayat 68

- `who invoke no other deity along with Allah,`
- `nor take any life - which Allah has forbidden -`
- `save justly;`
- `who do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse - and whoso does that shall meet its penalty;`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The true servants refrain from three great sins: **shirk**, **murder** and **adultery**.
  - The Prophet (peace be upon him) himself warned of their gravity.
  - According to Abdullah bin Masud, when someone asked him about the worst sins, he replied, 
    - (1) It is to set up someone as equal in rank with Allah, Who has created you. 
    - (2) To kill your own child for fear of its sustenance.
    - (3) To commit adultery with the wife of your neighbor.
  - (Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmizi, Nasai, Ahmad).
  - Obviously this is not a complete list of the heinous sins. But these three instances have been cited because they were most prevalent in the Arab society of those days.

## Ayat 69

- `his torment shall be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection,`
- `and he will abide in it in ignominy -`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This can have two meanings:
    - (1) His punishment will never come to an end, but it will continue being inflicted relentlessly over and over again.
    - (2) the person who in addition to the sins of disbelief, shirk and atheism, would have committed murders, adultery and other sins, will get separate punishment for rebellion and for each other sin. He will be accountable for each of his major and minor sins none of which will be pardoned. For instance, for each murder and for each act of adultery he will be given a separate punishment, and likewise, there will be a separate punishment for every sin committed by him.

## Ayat 70

- `unless he repents and believes and does righteous works.`
- `For such, Allah will change their evil deeds into good deeds.1`
- `Allah is Ever Forgiving, Most Compassionate.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is a good news for those people who repented and reformed themselves, for they will have the benefit of the general amnesty contained in (verse 70). 
  - This was regarded as a great blessing by the true servants because very few of those who embraced Islam had been free from those vices during their ignorance, and were terrified by the threat contained in (verses 63-69),     but this amnesty not only redeemed them but filled them with hope.

## Ayat 71

- `Whosoever repents1 and does good,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It has two meanings:
      - (1) When he has repented sincerely, he will start a new life of belief and obedience to Allah and by His grace and help will start doing good deeds instead of evil deeds that he used to do in his life of unbelief, and his evil deeds will be replaced by good deeds.
      - (2) Not only will his evil deeds done in the past be written off, but it will also be recorded in his conduct register that he was the servant who gave up rebellion against his Lord and adopted the way of His obedience. Then, as he will feel more and more sorry for his past sins and offer repentance, more and more good deeds will be credited to him.
      - For repenting of one’s wrong doing and seeking forgiveness is in itself a good deed. Thus, good deeds will supersede all his evil deeds in his conduct register, and he will not only escape punishment in the Hereafter but, in addition, he will also be blessed with high favors by Allah.
- `he returns to Allah in the manner that he should.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, ultimately everyone has to return to Allah for Allah alone is man’s last and real refuge.
    - He alone can reward him for his good deeds or punish him for his evil deeds.
    - He alone is All-Merciful and All Compassionate, Who receives the penitent with forgiveness and Who does not rebuke him for his past errors provided that he has repented sincerely, and adopted the right attitude and reformed himself.

## Ayat 72

- `(The true servants of the Merciful One) are those who do not bear witness to any falsehood`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This also has two meanings:
      - (1) They do not give evidence (in the court of law etc.) in regard to a false thing in order to prove it right, when in fact it is a falsehood, or at best a doubtful thing.
      - (2) They have no intention to witness anything which is false, evil or wicked as spectators.
    - In this sense, every sin and every indecency, every sham and counterfeit act is a falsehood.
    - A true servant of Allah recognizes it as false and shuns it even if it is presented in the seemingly beautiful forms of art.
- `and who, when they pass by frivolity, pass by it with dignity;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Arabic word laghv implies all that is vain, useless and meaningless and it also covers falsehood.
    - The true servants pass by in a dignified manner if they ever come across what is vain, as if it were a heap of filth.
    - They do not stay there to enjoy the filth of moral impurity, obscenity or foul language, nor do they intentionally go anywhere to hear or see or take part in any sort of filth.
      - For further details, see(E.N. 4 of Surah Al-Mominoon).

## Ayat 73

- `who, when they are reminded of the revelations of their Lord,1 do not fall at them deaf and blind;`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The true servants of Allah do not behave like the blind and the deaf towards the revelations of Allah, when they are recited to them for their admonition.
  - They do not turn a deaf ear to their teachings and message and do not deliberately close their eyes to the signs that they are asked to observe, but are deeply moved by them.
  - They follow and practice what they are enjoined and retrain from what is forbidden.

## Ayat 74

- `who are prone to pray:`
- **`"Our Lord! Grant us that our spouses and our offspring be a joy to our eyes,`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The most distinctive characteristic of the true servants is their eagerness for prayer to Allah.
    - In (verse 65) their prayer for their own salvation and in (verse 74 )their prayer for their wives and children have been cited: Our Lord, make our wives and children true believers so that they should practice righteousness and become a source of comfort for us.
    - Their prayer shows that the true servants of Allah are more concerned about the salvation of their beloved ones in the Hereafter than the enjoyment of the world.
- `and do make us the leaders of the God-fearing."`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It should be noted that this characteristic has been cited here to show that the true servants had sincerely believed in the message. That is why they were so concerned about the faith of their beloved ones. It should also be kept in mind that many of the near and dear ones of the believers had not as yet embraced Islam.
    - If a husband had embraced Islam, the wife was still an unbeliever, and if a youth had accepted Islam, his parents and brothers and sisters were still involved in disbelief, and vice versa. Therefore, the true servants wept and prayed for them, whenever the picture of their horrible state in Hell came before their eyes.

## Ayat 75

- `They are the ones who will be rewarded for their patience:`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word sabr (fortitude) has been used here in its most comprehensive sense. The true servants courageously endured their persecution by the enemies of the truth; they remained firm and steadfast in their struggle to establish Allah’s way in the land. They carried out their duties enjoined by Allah sincerely and tearlessly without any concern for the worldly losses and deprivation, and they withstood all temptations held out by Satan and all the lusts of the flesh.
- `lofty palaces will be granted to them,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Ghurfah is a high mansion and the word is generally used for the upper chamber of a two storey house.
    - But the reality is that the highest buildings made by man in this world, even the Taj Mahal of India and the skyscrapers of New York, are not true imitation of the excellent abodes in Paradise.
    - They are so magnificent, grand and beautiful that human imagination cannot form any picture of their grandeur.
- `and they will be received with greeting and salutation.`

## Ayat 76

- **`Therein they shall abide for ever: how good an abode, and how good a resting-place!`**

## Ayat 77

- `Say to them (O Muhammad):`
- `"My Lord would not care for you were it not for your prayer1. But now that you have given the lie to (the Message of Allah), an inextricable punishment shall soon come upon you."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This warning to the disbelievers has been given in order to contrast it with the great rewards that have been promised to the true servants of Allah, as if to say: **If you do not invoke Allah for help and protection, and do not worship Him, you will have no value and importance in His sight, and He will not care at all for you because He does not stand in need of any help from you. It is indeed for your own sake that He has given you the opportunity to invoke Him so that He may turn in mercy towards you; otherwise there is no difference between you and the rest of creation.**
