**Ayat  1 - 14**
# Ruku 1


## Ayat 1:

- تَبَـٰرَكَ ٱلَّذِى
  - `Blessed is He`
    - Maarif-ul-Quran: 
      - The word Tabaraka is derived from barakah, which literally means 'to grow' or 'increase'. 
      - When it is related to Allah, it signifies 'to be highest in all respects' and it conveys a meaning similar to Allahu Akbar 'Allah is the Highest'.
- بِيَدِهِ ٱلْمُلْكُ
  - ` in Whose Hand is the dominion of the Universe`
    - Maarif-ul-Quran: 
      - بِيَدِهِ الْمُلْكُ (in Whose hand is the Kingdom): The word Yad (hand) is attributed to Allah at many places in the Qur'an, whereas He is beyond having a body, limbs or organs. 
      - As a result, the word must, of necessity, be taken as one of the mutashabihat. 
      - We need to believe in its reality, but it is not possible for anyone to grasp its exact nature. 
      - It is improper to pursue this subject. 
      - The word Mulk (Kingdom) refers to the Kingdom of the whole universe, of the heavens and the earth and of the mortal world as well as of the Hereafter
- وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ قَدِيرٌ
  - `and Who has power over everything`

**Maarif ul Quran**

- The verse under comment refers to four of the Divine attributes. 
    1. His existence
    2. His comprehending all the attributes of perfection and being most Exalted; 
    3. His being the ruler of the heavens and earth
    4. His having power over everything. 
   
- The verses that follow are adduced as proofs of these attributes, which become clear by pondering over the creation of Allah. 
- Therefore, the next verses refer to the various types of creation in the universe as proofs positive of the existence and Oneness of Allah and His all-encompassing knowledge and power. 
  - To begin with, reference is made to those proofs of the divine omnipotence that are available in human beings themselves who are the noblest creation in the universe.
  -  The words الَّذِي خَلَقَ الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَاةَ (the One who created death and life) are meant for this purpose, (as will be explained shortly). 
  -  Then, several verses (3 to 5) invite consideration to the creation of heavens to find proofs of Allah's omnipotence. Thereafter, verses 15 and 16 call our attention to the creation of the earth and its benefits. Lastly, the creatures living in the heavenly atmosphere, that is, the birds are mentioned in verse 19.


Ayat 2: 
- `ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلْمَوْتَ وَٱلْحَيَوٰةَ`
  - `Who created death and life`
- `وَٱلْحَيَوٰةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًۭا ۚ`
  - `that He might try you as to which of you is better in deed.`
    - In between death and life, everything is a test.
- `عَمَلًۭا ۚ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْغَفُورُ`
  - `He is the Most Mighty, the Most Forgiving;`
    - "Al-Aziz" denotes the first part of Ayah as he is the MIGHTIEST since only He can create "Death" and "Life" and no any other being can.
      - Notice that, death is mentioned before than the life.
  - Note how "Al-Aziz" comes first denoting to the creation of something that cannot be done by any other being which is the first part of this Ayah and how "Al-Ghafoor" came afterwards which links directly with the second part of the Ayah where 'test' is mentioned which means that none of us can pass this test with flying colors and we have hope that Allah is "Al-Ghafoor", "Most Forgiving" for all of our mistakes, provided that we 'ask' for the forgiveness.
