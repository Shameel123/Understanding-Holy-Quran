**Ayat 66 - 70**

## Ayat 66

- `Surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle:`
  - `We provide you to drink out of that which is in their bellies between the faeces and the blood - pure milk - which is a palatable drink for those who take it.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Between excretions and the blood”. This refers to the most wonderful process of the formation of pure milk in the bellies of the cattle. For, the fodder they eat turns into blood, filth and pure milk, which is altogether different from the first two in its nature, color and usefulness. Some cattle produce milk in such abundance that after suckling their young ones a large quantity of it is left to make excellent human food.

## Ayat 67

- `And out of the fruits of date-palms and grapes you derive intoxicants as well as wholesome sustenance.1`
- `Surely there is a sign for those who use reason.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Incidentally it implies that the juice of the fruits of date palms and vines contains two things.
    - One is that which is pure and wholesome food for man
    - and the other is that which turns into alcohol after it becomes rotten.
  - But it has been left to the choice of man to obtain pure healthy food from this providence or to drink it as intoxicant wine to excite him and make him lose his self control. This also contains a hint as to the prohibition of wine.

## Ayat 68

- `Your Lord inspired the bee, saying:`
  - `"Set up hives in the mountains and in the trees and in the trellises that people put up,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The lexical meaning of the Arabic word wahi is secret inspiration which is felt only by the one who inspires and the other who is inspired with.
  - The Quran has used this word both for the instinctive inspiration by Allah to His creation in general and for the revelation towards His Prophets in particular.
  - Allah sends His wahi to the heavens with His command and they begin functioning in accordance with it (Surah Al-Momin, Ayat 12).
  - He will send this to the earth with His command and it will relate the story of all that had happened on and in it.
  - He sends wahi to the bee and inspires it with faculties to perform the all of its wonderful work instinctively (Ayat 68).
  - The same is true of the bird that learns to fly, the fish that learns to swim, the newly born child that learns to suck milk, etc. Then, it is also wahi with which Allah inspires a human being with a spontaneous idea (Surah Al-Qasas, Ayat 7).
  - The same is the case with all the great discoveries, inventions, works of literature and art, etc. which would not have been possible without the benefit of wahi.
  - As a matter of fact, every human being at one time or the other feels its mental or spiritual influence in the form of an idea or thought or plan or dream, which is confirmed by a subsequent experience to be the right guidance from the unseen wahi.

## Ayat 69

- `then suck the juice of every kind of fruit and keep treading the ways of your Lord`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Follow the ways of your Lord” means work in accordance with the methods which have been taught to thee by Allah’s wahi for the smooth running of hive life.
    - It is Allah’s wahi (instinctive inspiration) that has taught the bees how to build their wonderful factory with separate combs to rear brood, combs to turn nectar into honey, combs to store food, in short, separate combs to fulfill every aspect of hive life.
    - It is wahi that has taught the bees how to organize themselves into a cooperative society for collective effort to run the factory with the queen and thousands of workers to perform a variety of specific tasks.
    - All these things have been made so smooth for them by wahi that the bees never feel the necessity of ever thinking about it.
    - They have been running smoothly their factory with their collective effort for thousands of years with perfect accuracy.
- `which have been made easy." There comes forth from their bellies a drink varied in colours, wherein there is healing for men.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Though honey is a wholesome food with a sweet taste and has medicinal power as well, its latter quality has been mentioned only because the former is too obvious. 
    - It is used as a medicine to cure several diseases because it contains the juice and glucose of flowers and fruits in the best form. Besides this, it is also used in preparing and preserving other medicines because it does not rot. It also preserves other things from decay. That is why it has been used for centuries as a substitute for alcohol. And if the beehive is built at a place, which abounds in certain medicinal herbs, its honey does not remain mere honey, but becomes also the essence of that herb.
    - It is expected that if bees are used methodically for extracting essence from herbs, that essence will prove to be much better than the one obtained in the laboratories.
- `Verily there is a sign in this for those who reflect.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This passage (Ayats 48-69) contains proofs of **Tauhid** and **life after death**.
    - These were necessitated, for the disbelievers and the mushriks were bitterly opposed to the Prophet (peace be upon him) mainly because of these two doctrines.
    - The acceptance of the first doctrine demolished the whole system of life based on shirk or atheism because to acknowledge Allah to be the sole Provider, the Helper and the Protector left no room for the worship of any god or goddess. The proof of Tauhid is based on the observance of the structure of the cattle, the bees, the date palms and vineyards and their usefulness to mankind. Naturally the question arises: Who has designed these in the manner and for the purpose they have been created? The only obvious answer is that it is the All-Wise and All-Beneficent Allah Who has designed all these things for the benefit of mankind to produce such varieties of food that are so wholesome and so tasty.
    - The Prophet, therefore, rightly demanded: When you yourselves admit, and you cannot but admit, that it is Allah alone Who has provided milk, honey, dates, grapes and the like, He and none but He is worthy of your worship, praise, gratitude and allegiance. Why do you then insist on making offerings to your self made gods and goddesses?

## Ayat 70

- `Allah has created you, and then He causes you to die.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It is to emphasize this: Allah not only provides you with the necessities and good things of life (as stated in the preceding verses), but also has full power over your life and death. None else has any power to give lift or cause death.
- `Some of you have your lives prolonged to an abject old age, when one loses all knowledge after having acquired it.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This fact has been mentioned to bring home to the disbelievers and the mushriks that knowledge, which gives superiority to man over all creatures on this earth, has been given by Allah, as if to say: You yourselves have seen that when a man, who once possessed much knowledge, becomes very old, he is reduced to a mere lump of flesh. 
    - Then that man who once taught knowledge to others loses all his senses and cannot look even after his own self.
- `Allah is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.`
