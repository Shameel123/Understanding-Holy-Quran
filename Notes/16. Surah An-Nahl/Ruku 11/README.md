**Ayat 77 - 83**

## Ayat 77

- `Allah has full knowledge of the truths beyond the reach of perception both in the heavens and the earth;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The subsequent sentence shows that this is the answer to a question which was frequently put to the Prophet (peace be upon him) by the disbelievers of Makkah. The question which has not been cited was this: If the Resurrection so often you talk of is really coming, let us know the date of its coming.
- `and the coming of the Hour will take no more than the twinkling of an eye; it may take even less.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, don’t be under the delusion that the Resurrection will come gradually and take a long time: you will neither be able to see it coming at a distance nor guard against it and make preparations to meet it. For it will come suddenly without any previous notice, in the twinkling of an eye or even will take less time than this. Therefore, now is the time to consider this matter seriously and to decide about your attitude towards it. You should not depend upon this false hope that there is still a long time in the coming of the Resurrection and you will set matters right with Allah when you will see it coming.
- `Indeed Allah has power over everything.`

## Ayat 78

- `Allah has brought you forth from your mothers' wombs when you knew nothing,`
- `and then gave you hearing, and sight and thinking hearts`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is to remind them that when they were born they were more helpless and ignorant than the young one of an animal, but Allah gave them ears to hear, eyes to see and minds to think and reflect. 
    - These have enabled them to acquire every kind of information and knowledge to carry on their worldly affairs efficiently. So much so that these sensory faculties are the only means which help man attain so much progress as to rule over everything on the earth.
- `so that you may give thanks.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you should be grateful to that Allah Who has bestowed upon you such blessings as these. It will be ingratitude on your part if you hear everything with your ears except the word of God, and see everything with your eyes except the signs of Allah and consider seriously about all the matters except your Benefactor Who has blessed you with these favors.

## Ayat 79

- `Have they never noticed the birds how they are held under control in the middle of the sky, where none holds them (from falling) except Allah?`
- `Surely there are signs in this for those who believe.`

## Ayat 80

- `Allah has made your houses a repose, and has provided you with the skins of the cattle for your habitation`  
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Tents of skin which are in common use in Arabia.
- `which are light to handle both when you travel and when you camp;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, when you want to start on a journey, you can easily fold your tents and carry them, and when you want to make a short halt, you can easily unfold them and pitch them for shelter and rest.
- `and out of their wool and their fur and their hair He has given you furnishings and goods for use over a period of time.`

## Ayat 81

- `And Allah has provided shade for you out of some of the things He has created;`
- `and He has provided you with shelters in the mountains, and has given you coats that protect you from heat`
- `as well as coats that protect you in battle.`
- `Thus does He complete His favour upon you that you may submit to Him.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Quran has not mentioned protection from cold for either of the two reasons:
      - (1) Because the use of garments in the summer season is a symbol of cultural perfection and obviously there is no need to mention the lower stages of culture. Or
      - (2) the use of garments in hot countries has specially been mentioned because the main use of garments there is for protection from the hot pestilential furious wind. Therefore, one has to cover one’s head, neck, ears, and the whole of his body to protect it from the hot wind which would otherwise scorch him to death.

## Ayat 82

- `But if they turn away, your only duty is to clearly deliver the message of the truth.`

## Ayat 83

- `They are aware of the favours of Allah, and yet refuse to acknowledge them.`
- `Most of them are determined not to accept the Truth.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here the denial of the blessings of Allah refers to practical denial by the disbelievers of Makkah. For they did not deny that all these blessings were from Allah but along with this they believed that their saints and gods also had contributed towards them. This is why they associated their intercessors in their gratitude to Allah for these blessings. Nay, they were even more grateful to them than to Allah. Allah regards this association as denial of His blessings, ingratitude and forgetfulness of His favors.
