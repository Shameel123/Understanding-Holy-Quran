**Ayat 26 - 34**

## Ayat 26

- `Surely many people before them had plotted in a similar manner to (vanquish the Truth),`
- `but Allah uprooted the whole structure of their plot from its foundations`
- `so that the roof fell in upon them,`
- `and the chastisement (of Allah) visited them from unknown directions.`

## Ayat 27

- `And again, on the Day of Resurrection, He will bring them to disgrace, and say:`
  - `"Tell Me, now, where are those to whom you ascribed a share in My Divinity, and for whose sake you disputed (with the upholders of the Truth)?"`
- `Those who were endowed with knowledge (in the world) will say:` 
  - `"Surely today humiliation and misery shall be the lot of the unbelievers";`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - There is a gap between this answer and the preceding question which has been left for the reader to fill. When Allah will ask: Now where are My partners, there will be dead silence in the plain where the entire mankind shall have to gather on the occasion of Resurrection. The disbelievers and the mushriks will be dumb founded for they will be at a loss to find an answer to this. Then those who had been given knowledge will make the assertion, “Indeed, disgrace, this day, and evil are upon the disbelievers.”


## Ayat 28

- `the same unbelievers`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is Allah’s addition to the previous assertion, and not its continuation. Those commentators, who have wrongly considered this as continuation of the preceding sentence, are unable to offer any satisfactory explanation for their opinion.
- `who, when the angels seize them and cause them to die while they are engaged in wrong-doing,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, when the angels take possession of their souls at the time of death.
- `they will proffer their submission saying:`
  - `"We were engaged in no evil."`
- `(The angels will answer them):`
  - `"Surely Allah knows well all that you did.`

## Ayat 29

- `Go now,`
- `and enter the gate of Hell,`
- `and abide in it for ever.1"`
- `Evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The (Ayats 28 and 32), and several other verses in the Quran, clearly and definitely assert that immediately after death, souls suffer torment or enjoy peace in the world of Barzakh.
  - The traditions use the word qabar (grave) metaphorically for this existence of the souls.
  - This is the world in which souls enter immediately after death and will remain therein up to the Day of Resurrection.
  - Yet the disbelievers of the traditions declare that after death souls will remain in a dormant state up to the time of Resurrection, and will neither feel any pain nor joy, nor will be conscious of anything at all.
  - Obviously, this is a wrong opinion. For, according to (Ayat 28), just after death when the disbelievers will be conscious of the fact that they had been leading an evil life, they will try to make the angels believe that they had not done any evil deed. The angels will rebuke them at this boldness and will tell them that they shall have to go into Hell.
  - On the other hand, according to( verse 32), just after their death, the pious believers are welcomed by the angels and given the good news that they will enter into Paradise.
  - Besides these verses, there is the mention of a dialogue between the angels and those Muslims, who did not migrate to Al- Madinah, after their souls were seized by the angels in (Surah An-Nisa, Ayat 97). Above all, according to (Surah Almomin, Ayats 45-46), the people of Pharaoh have been encircled by a torment and are exposed before the fire of Hell every morning and every evening. This will go on till the Day of Resurrection when they shall be sentenced to eternal torment.

## Ayat 30

- `And when the God-fearing are asked:`
  - `"What has your Lord revealed?"`
- `they answer:`
  - `"Something excellent!"`
- `Good fortune in this world awaits those who do good; and certainly the abode of the Hereafter is even better for them.`
- `How excellent is the abode of the God-fearing:`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In contrast to the disbelievers (Ayat 24), the righteous people spoke highly of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and of the teachings of the Quran to the people coming from the suburbs of Makkah. Unlike the former they did not delude the people nor created misunderstandings in the minds. They were full of praise for them and told the truth about the Prophet (peace be upon him).

## Ayat 31

- `everlasting gardens that they shall enter;`
- `the gardens beneath which rivers shall flow,`
- `and where they shall have whatever they desire!`
- `Thus does Allah reward the God-fearing,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the best blessing of Paradise. The dweller will get there whatever he will desire and wish and there will be nothing at all to offend him.
  - This is the blessing that has never been attained even by the richest and the most powerful people in this world.
  - On the contrary, every dweller of Paradise will enjoy this blessing to his fill because he will always have everything to his desire and liking, and will have each and every wish and desire fulfilled.

## Ayat 32

- `those whose souls the angels seize while they are in a state of purity, saying:`
  - `"Peace be upon you.`
  - `Enter Paradise as a reward for your deeds."`

## Ayat 33

- `(O Muhammad),`
- `are they waiting for anything else than that the angels should appear before them,`
- `or that your Lord's judgement should come?1`
- `Many before them acted with similar temerity.`
- `And then what happened with them was not Allah's wrong-doing; they rather wronged themselves.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is to admonish the unbelievers to this effect: Why are they still hesitating to accept the message which is very simple and clear?
  - We have tried every method to present each aspect of the truth clearly with arguments and brought witnesses thereof from the whole system of the universe, and have left no room for any man of understanding to stick to shirk.
  - Now what are they waiting for is nothing more than this that the angel of death should come before them and then they will accept the message at the last moment of their lives.
  - Or, do they wait for the scourge of God to overtake them and make them accept the Message?

## Ayat 34

- `The evil consequences of their misdeeds overtook them and what they mocked at overwhelmed them.`
