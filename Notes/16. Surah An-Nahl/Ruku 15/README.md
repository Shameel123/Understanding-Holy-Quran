**Ayat 111 - 119**

## Ayat 111

- `Allah's judgement will come about them all on the Day`
- `when everyone shall come pleading in his defence,`
- `and everyone shall be fully requited for his deeds`
- `and none shall be wronged in the least.`

## Ayat 112

- `Allah sets forth the parable of (the people of) a town who were secure and content and whose sustenance came in abundance from every quarter.`
- `But then the people of the town showed ingratitude towards Allah for His bounties,`
- `so Allah afflicted them with hunger and fear in punishment for their evil deeds.`

## Ayat 113

- `Most certainly a Messenger came to them from among them;`
- `but they rejected him, calling him a liar.`
- `Therefore chastisement seized them while they engaged in wrong-doing.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That habitation has not been specified here nor have the commentators definitely pointed out which that habitation was. 
  - However, there is a saying of Ibn Abbas (which seems to be correct) that the place referred to is Makkah itself. In that case, hunger and fear will mean the famine which prevailed over the people of Makkah for several years during the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him).

## Ayat 114

- `So eat out of the lawful and good sustenance that Allah has bestowed upon you,`
- `and thank Allah for His bounty,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This shows that the above mentioned famine had come to an end at the time of the revelation of this Surah.
- `if it is Him that you serve.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here the observation of the lawful and the unlawful has been made the test of worship of Allah. Those who claim to be the servants of Allah will eat what is lawful and pure and show gratitude to Him and will scrupulously refrain from what is forbidden and impure.

## Ayat 115

- `Allah has forbidden you only carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine; also any animal over which the name of any other than Allah has been pronounced.`
- `But whoever eats of them under compelling necessity - neither desiring it nor exceeding the limit of absolute necessity - surely for such action Allah is Much Forgiving, Most Merciful.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Please refer also to (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 173), (Surah Al-Maidah, Ayat 3) and (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayat 145).

## Ayat 116

- `And do not utter falsehoods by letting your tongues declare:`
  - `"This is lawful"`
  - `and`
- `"That is unlawful,"`
- `thus fabricating lies against Allah.`
- `Surely those who fabricate lies against Allah will never prosper.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse clearly shows that none but Allah has the right to declare a thing to be lawful or unlawful. Or, in other words, the right of making laws exclusively rests with Allah. Therefore, any person who will dare to decide about the lawful and the unlawful will transgress his powers. Of course, a person, who acknowledges the divine law as the final authority, may deduce from it whether a certain thing or action is lawful or unlawful.

## Ayat 117

- `Brief is their enjoyment of the world, and thereafter they shall suffer a painful chastisement.`

## Ayat 118

- `We have already recounted to you`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This refers to: “And We prohibited all animals with claws to those people who had adopted Judaism.” (Surah Al-Anaam, Ayat 146). In this(verse 118) Allah has stated that certain things were made unlawful because of the disobedience of the Jews.
- `what We prohibited2 to the Jews.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here a question arises. Which of the two Surahs, Al-Anaam or An-Nahl, was first revealed? This is because in (verse 118), a reference has been made to (verse 146 of Al-Anaam). Also in (verse 119 of Al-Anaam): “And why should you not eat that thing over which Allah’s name has been mentioned, when He has already given you a detail of those things that have been declared to be unlawful for you except in case of extremity?” a reference has been made to (verse 115 of An- Nahl).
- `In so doing We did not wrong them;`
- `it is they who wronged themselves.`

## Ayat 119

- `But to those who commit evil out of ignorance and then repent and amend their ways, thereafter your Lord will be Much Forgiving, Most Merciful.`
