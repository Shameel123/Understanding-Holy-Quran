**Ayat 41 - 50**

## Ayat 41

- `As for those who have forsaken their homes for the sake of Allah after enduring persecution,`
- `We shall certainly grant them a good abode in this world;`
- `and surely the reward of the Hereafter is much greater.`
- `If they could but know (what an excellent end awaits)`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is to comfort the Muslim emigrants from Makkah to Habash, who were forced to leave their homes because of the unbearable persecution they suffered at the hands of the disbelievers.
  - The change of the scene from the disbelievers to the emigrants to Habash contains a subtle warning to the disbelievers that they should not remain under any delusion that they would get off free from punishment for their cruel behavior towards those Muslims, so as to say: O cruel people! There shall be Resurrection to reward the oppressed believers and to punish you for your persecution of them.

## Ayat 42

- `those who remain steadfast and put their trust in their Lord.`

## Ayat 43

- `(O Muhammad),`
- `whenever We raised any Messengers before you,`
- `they were no other than human beings;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the answer to the objection of the mushriks of Makkah (which has not been cited here) that they could not believe that Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a Prophet of God because he was a human being like them.
    - They have been told that the same objection had been raised against all the Prophets who came before him.
- `(except that) to them We sent revelation.`
- `So ask those who possess knowledge if you do not know.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Those who possess knowledge” are the scholars of the people of the Books and others, who, though not scholars in the strict sense had sufficient knowledge of the teachings of the revealed Books and were acquainted with the stories of the former Prophets.

## Ayat 44

- `We raised the Messengers earlier with Clear Signs and Divine Books,`
- `and We have now sent down this Reminder upon you that you may elucidate to people the teaching that has been sent down for them,`
- `and that the people may themselves reflect.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In this connection, it is worthwhile to note that this duty of making plain and explaining the teachings of the Book was to be performed by Prophet not only by word of mouth but also practically.
  - It was required that he should organize, under his own guidance, a Muslim community and establish it in accordance with the principles of the Book.
  - This duty of the Prophet (peace be upon him) has been stated here especially to show the wisdom of sending a man as a Messenger, for, otherwise the Book could have been sent through the angels or could have been printed and sent directly to each man. But in this way; that purpose for which Allah in His Wisdom and Bounty and Providence designed to send the Book could not have been served.
  - For, that purpose demanded that the Book should be brought by a perfect man, who should present it piece by piece, explain its meaning, remove the difficulties and doubts, answer objections etc. and above all, he should show towards those who rejected and opposed it that kind of attitude which is worthy of the bearer of this Book. 
  - On the other hand, he should guide those who believed in it in every aspect of life and set before them his own excellent pattern of life. Then he should train them individually and collectively on the principles of the Book; so as to make them a model society for the rest of mankind.

## Ayat 45

- `Do those who have been devising evil plans (against the mission of the Messenger) feel secure that`
- `Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them up`
- `or that chastisement will not come upon them from a direction that they will not even be able to imagine;`

## Ayat 46

- `or that He will not suddenly seize them while they are going about to and fro and they will be unable to frustrate His design,`

## Ayat 47

- `or that He will not seize them when they are apprehensive of the impending calamity?`
- **`Surely your Lord is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.`**

## Ayat 48

- `Do the people not see how the objects Allah has created cast their shadows right and left,`
- `prostrating themselves in utter submission to Allah?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The argument is this: The fact that everything a man, an animal, a tree or a mountain casts its shadow, is a clear proof of its material nature, and everything which is made of matter, is a creation of Allah and is subject to a universal law.
  - In this case the law is that every material thing casts its shadow, which is symbolical of its servitude, and it cannot have any share whatsoever in Godhead.

## Ayat 49

- `All living creatures and all angels in the heavens and on the earth are in prostration before Allah;1`
- `and never do they behave in arrogant defiance.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, not only all things on the earth alone but also all things in the heavens, including all those whom people have been regarding as gods and goddesses, and considering to be closely related to Allah are subservient to God, and have no share whatsoever in His Godhead. Incidentally, it implies the existence of living creatures not only on the earth but in the planets, too.

## Ayat 50

- `They hold their Lord, Who is above them, in fear, and do as they are bidden.`
