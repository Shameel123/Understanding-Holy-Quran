**Ayat 10 - 21**

## Ayat 10 

- `He it is Who sends down water for you from the sky`
- `out of which you drink and`
- `out of which grow the plants on which you pasture your cattle,`

## Ayat 11

- `and by virtue of which He causes crops and olives and date-palms and grapes and all kinds of fruit to grow for you. Surely in this there is a great Sign for those who reflect.`

## Ayat 12

- `He has subjected for you the night and the day and the sun and the moon and the stars have also been made subservient by His command.`
- `Surely there are Signs in this for those who use their reason.`

## Ayat 13

- `And there are also Signs for those who take heed in the numerous things of various colours that He has created for you on earth.`

## Ayat 14

- `And He it is Who has subjected the sea that you may eat fresh fish from it and bring forth ornaments from it that you can wear.`
- `And you see ships ploughing their course through it so that you may go forth seeking His Bounty and be grateful to Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, try to get your sustenance in lawful ways.

## Ayat 15

- `And He has placed firm mountains on the earth`
- `lest it should move away from you,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This shows that the real function of mountains is to regulate the motion and speed of the earth. We have come to this conclusion, for the Quran has made this benefit of mountains very prominent in many places. Therefore, their other benefits should be regarded as incidental.
- `and has made rivers and tracks that you may find your way,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Natural ways are those routes which are formed along the banks of streams, ravines and rivers. Though the importance of these ways is great even in the plains, one feels their sore need, especially in the mountainous regions.

## Ayat 16

- `and He has set other landmarks in the earth.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is a sign of Allah that He has broken the monotony of land by placing conspicuous landmarks on it to distinguish different regions from one another.
    - These have many benefits and one of these is to help guide travelers and navigators to their destinations.
    - One also realizes the importance and value of these landmarks, when one is traveling through a sandy desert where there are hardly any objects to guide on the way, and one is liable to lose the way any time.
    - One feels the lack of landmarks much more in the sea voyage.
    - It is in the deserts and the seas that people realize the true significance of stars by which they are directed aright to their destinations.
- `And by the stars too do people find their way.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This verse contains arguments for Tauhid.
    - Providence, and Compassion of Allah, and also a proof of Prophethood.
    - For the mind is instinctively turned towards this question:
      - Can it be possible that Allah who has made so elaborate arrangements for man’s guidance to fulfill his physical needs has neglected to provide for his moral and spiritual needs?
      - It cannot be so, for it is obvious that even the greatest loss of some physical necessity due to the adoption of a wrong way is nothing as compared with the loss of spiritual and moral values due to deviation from the right way.
      - It would be nothing less than having doubt in Allah’s Compassion and Providence to think that He, Who had made so elaborate provision for man’s guidance on land and sea by creating mountains, rivers, stars and other objects, would have neglected to make provision for his moral and spiritual guidance.
      - And it stands to reason that He must have provided prominent beacons of light to guide man to that right way of life which is indispensable to his true success.

## Ayat 17

- `Is then the One Who creates like the one who does not create?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, if you, people of Makkah, acknowledge (and they acknowledged this just as other mushriks did) that Allah alone is the Creator of all of you and everything, and no one of the partners, you have set up with Him, has created anything in the universe.
      - How is it, then, that you ascribe from among the creation, a status equal to or like that of the Creator in the system of universe created by Him?
      - How can it be possible that the power and the rights of the creation should be equal to the power and the rights of the Creator in the universe created by Himself? 
      - How can it be believed that the Creator and the creation possess the same qualities and characteristics, or can have such relationship as of father and son?
- `Will you not, then, take heed?`

## Ayat 18

- `For, were you to count the favours of Allah, you will not be able to count them.`
- `Surely Allah is Ever Forgiving, Most Merciful.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here the connection of Allah’s attributes, “Forgiving and Compassionate”, with the preceding verse is so obvious that it has been left unmentioned.
    - It is this: Though Allah goes on showering countless blessings upon people, they behave in an ungrateful, faithless and rebellious manner towards Him.
    - He does not punish them immediately, but gives them respite, for He is Forgiving and Compassionate.
    - This is true of both individuals and communities.
    - There are people, who deny even the existence of God, yet He goes on bestowing His favors on them for years.
    - There are others who set up partners with Him in his attributes, power and rights, and show their gratitude to others than Him for His blessings, yet He does not withhold His favors from them.
    - There are still others who profess to acknowledge Him as their Creator and Benefactor, yet rebel against Him and are disobedient to Him and consider freedom from Him to be their birth right, but in spite of all this He continues to shower His countless blessings on them as long as they live.

## Ayat 19

- `Allah knows all that you conceal and all that you disclose.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - A grave misunderstanding might arise as to why Allah’s blessings should continue to be showered even on those who deny Him and set up partners with Him and are disobedient to Him.
    - The foolish people are liable to conclude from this that He does not withhold His favors from such people because He has no knowledge of their wicked deeds, The Quran declares:
      - Even though He has full knowledge of all the deeds of the people, whether these are done secretly or openly, He does not discontinue His blessings on the sinners, for He is Forgiving, Compassionate and Merciful. Therefore: O people, get rid of this misunderstanding and reform yourselves.

## Ayat 20

- `Those whom they call upon beside Allah have created nothing; rather, they themselves were created;`

## Ayat 21

- `they are dead, not living.`
- `They do not even know when they will be resurrected.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The words employed here to refute man made deities clearly indicate that these deities were deceased prophets, saints, martyrs and pious and other extraordinary beings buried in their graves and not angels, jinns, devils or idols.
  - For the angels and devils are alive: therefore, the words, “They are dead, not living” cannot apply to them, and it is out of the question to say about idols of stone or wood that “They do not know at all when they shall again be raised to life” in the Hereafter.
  - As regards the objection to this version that there were no such deities in Arabia, this is based on the lack of knowledge of the history of the pre- Islamic period. It is well known that there was a large number of Jews and Christians living among many clans of Arabia, who used to invoke and worship their Prophets, saints, etc. It is also a fact that many gods of the mushriks of Arabia were human beings, whose idols they had set up for worship after their death.
  - According to a tradition cited in Bukhari on the authority of Ibn Abbas: **“Wadd, Sua, Yaghuth, Yauq, and Nasr were pious human beings, whom the succeeding generations had made gods.”**
  - In another tradition, related by Aishah: **“Asaf and Nailah were human beings.”**
  - There are also traditions to the same effect about Lat, Munat and Uzza.
  - So much so that according to some traditions of the mushriks, Lat and Uzza were the beloved ones of Allah who used to pass His winter with Lat and summer with Uzza.
  - But Allah is absolutely free from such absurd things they attribute to Him.
