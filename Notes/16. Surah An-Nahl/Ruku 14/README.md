**Ayat 101 - 100**

## Ayat 101

- `Whenever We replace one verse by another verse - and Allah knows what He should reveal - they are wont to say:`
  - `"You are nothing but a fabricator1 (who has invented the Qur'an)."`
- `The fact is that most of them are ignorant of the Truth.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This may also mean: To send down one commandment to elaborate upon the other, for the commandments were sent down piecemeal in the Quran.
  - For instance, the commandments about prohibition and fornication were sent down gradually one after the other during several years. But We hesitate to accept this interpretation because An-Nahl is a Makki Surah and to the best of our information there is no instance to show that commandments were sent down piecemeal at Makkah. 
  - Therefore, we prefer the other interpretation.
  - The Quran has added details of one theme and explained the same with different kinds of illustrations at different places. Likewise it has related a story in different words at different places and presented its different aspects and details at other places. It has put forward one argument at one place to prove a theme and another at another place to prove the same theme. It has related one theme concisely at one place and in detail at the other.
  - That is what the disbelievers of Makkah put forward as proof that Muhammad (peace be upon him) forged the Quran himself.
  - They argued like this: Had the Quran been the Word of Allah, it would have related one thing in full at one place, for Allah’s knowledge is not defective that He should have to think out gradually the details of a theme and to give different versions to explain the same thing. In contrast to this, the knowledge of a human being is defective. A man has to think out gradually as has been done in the case of the Quran which is a clear proof that you have forged it yourself.

## Ayat 102

- `Tell them:`
  - `"It is the spirit of holiness that has brought it down, by stages,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The Holy Spirit: Gibril. Instead of using the name of the angel who brought revelation, his title has been deliberately mentioned to warn the disbelievers that the Holy Spirit who brought revelation is free from human frailties.
      - He is neither dishonest that he should add something to or take away something from the message he brought, nor is he a liar and forger that he should invent and state something in the name of Allah. Nor does he suffer from any human lust that he should practice a deceit. He is wholly pure and holy and conveys the Word of Allah intact.
  - `from your Lord so that it might bring firmness to those who believe,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, the fact that Allah sends down His message piecemeal does not mean that Allah’s knowledge and wisdom are defective as you consider because of your folly.
      - Allah sends His revelations gradually because human intelligence and capacity to grasp are limited and defective which do not let him understand the whole theme at one and the same time and make it firm in his mind.
      - Therefore, Allah in His wisdom conveyed His revelation piecemeal through the Holy Spirit. He sends a theme gradually and gives its details by and by and uses different methods and ways to make it plain to human beings so that they might grasp it according to their abilities and capabilities and become firm in their faith and knowledge.
  - `and guidance to the Right Way,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The second practical wisdom of sending down the Quran piecemeal was that those believers who obediently followed it, should get necessary instructions for the propagation of Islam and the solution of other problems of life at the time when they were actually needed. It is obvious that if those instructions had been sent down before time and at one and the same time they would not have been useful.
  - `and give glad tidings of felicity and success to those who submit to Allah."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - The third practical wisdom of not sending down the Quran as a whole at one and the same time was to give good tidings and encouragement to the obedient servants who were suffering from persecution and encountering great obstacles because they needed it over and over again.
      - That is why they were assured of ultimate success time and again to fill them with hope to carry on their mission.

## Ayat 103

- `Surely We know well that they say about you:`
  - `"It is only a human being who teaches him,"`
- `(notwithstanding) that he whom they maliciously hint at is of foreign tongue, while this (Qur'an) is plain Arabic speech.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:  
  - In this connection, traditions mention the names of several persons, one of whom is **Jabar**.
  - According to the disbelievers of Makkah he taught the Prophet (peace be upon him). However, one thing particularly noteworthy about all these persons is that they were non Arab slaves. Whosoever he might be, the fact that he used to recite the Torah and the Gospel and had an acquaintance with the Prophet (peace be upon him). This gave an opportunity to the disbelievers for spreading this false report that it was the particular slave who was the real author of the Holy Quran, but Muhammad (peace be upon him) presented it as the Word of God. This not only shows that his opponents were very impudent in spreading false accusations against the Prophet (peace be upon him) but also that, in general, people are not just in judging the worth of their contemporaries. They were ill treating like this that great personality who has had no parallel in history. 
  - Nevertheless, these people who had become blind in their opposition, preferred to attribute the authorship of the matchless Arabic Quran to a non Arab slave who had a smattering of the Torah and the Gospel.
  - Instead of accepting the claim of the Prophet (peace be upon him), who was an embodiment of truth, they attributed its authorship to an insignificant foreign slave. 

## Ayat 104

- `Surely Allah will not enable those who do not believe in the signs of Allah to be directed to the Right Way, and a painful chastisement awaits them.`

## Ayat 105 

- `(It is not the Prophet who invents lies),`
- `it is rather those who do not believe in the signs of Allah who invent lies.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This verse can also be rendered like this: A Prophet does not forge any false thing but those, who do not believe in the revelations of Allah, invent falsehoods.
- `They are liars.`

## Ayat 106

- `Except for those who were forced to engage in infidelity to Allah after believing the while their hearts remained firmly convinced of their belief, the ones whose hearts willingly embraced disbelief shall incur Allah's wrath and a mighty chastisement lies in store for them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse deals with the case of those Muslims who were being persecuted with cruelty and were being subjected to unbearable torments to force them to give up their faith. They are being told that if at any time they are forced to utter words of disbelief to save their lives, when in fact in their hearts they are secure against disbelief, they will be pardoned. On the other hand, if they accepted unbelief from the core of their hearts, they shall not escape the torment of Allah even if they succeed in saving their lives.
