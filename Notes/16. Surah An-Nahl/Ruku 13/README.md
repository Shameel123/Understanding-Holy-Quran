**Ayat 90 - 100**

## Ayat 90

- `Surely Allah enjoins justice, kindness and the doing of good to kith and kin,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this brief sentence Allah has enjoined three most important things on which alone depends the establishment of a sound and healthy society:
- `and forbids all that is shameful, evil and oppressive.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The first of these is justice which has two aspects.
- `He exhorts you so that you may be mindful.`

## Ayat 91

- `And fulfil the covenant which you have made with Allah`
- `and do not break your oaths after having firmly made them,`
- `and after having made Allah your witness.`
- `Surely Allah knows all that you do.`

## Ayat 92

- `And do not become like the woman who, after having painstakingly spun her yarn, caused it to disintegrate into pieces.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this verse, Allah has enjoined three kinds of covenants which have been mentioned in the order of their importance.
      1. The first of these covenants is the one between man and his Allah which is the most important of all.
      2. The second in importance is the covenant between one man or one group of men and another man or another group of men, which is taken with Allah as a witness or in which the name of God has been used.
      3. The third covenant is that which has been made without using Allah’s name. Though this is third in importance, its fulfillment is as important as that of the first two and the violation of any of these has been prohibited.
- `You resort to oaths as instruments of mutual deceit so that one people might take greater advantage than another although Allah puts you to the test through this.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this connection it should be noted that Allah has rebuked the people for the worst form of violation of treaties which has been creating the greatest disorder in the world.
    - It is a pity that even big people consider it to be a virtue to violate treaties in order to gain advantages for their people in political, economic and religious conflicts.
    - At one time the leader of one nation enters into a treaty with another nation for the interest of his own people but at another time the same leader publicly breaks the very same treaty for the interest of his people, or secretly violates it.
    - It is an irony that such violations are made even by those people who are honest in their private lives. Moreover, it is regrettable that their own people do not protest against them; nay, they eulogize them for such shameful feats of diplomacy. Therefore, Allah warns that every such treaty is a test of the character of those who enter into it, and of their nations. They might gain some apparent advantage for their people in this way, but they will not escape their consequences on the Day of Judgment.
- `Surely on the Day of Resurrection He will make clear the Truth concerning the matters over which you differed.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is to warn that decision about differences and disputes that lead to conflict will be made on the Day of Judgment. Therefore, these should not be made an excuse to break agreements and treaties. 
  - Even if one is wholly in the right and the opponent is wholly in the wrong. It is not right for the former to break treaties or make false propaganda or employ other deceitful methods to defeat the other.
  - If one does so, it will go against him on that Day because righteousness demands that one should not only be right in his theories and aims but should also use right methods and employ right means.
  - This warning has especially been given to those religious groups and sects who always suffer from this misunderstanding that they have a right to defeat their opponents because they are on the side of God and their opponents are rebels against Allah. Therefore, there is no obligation on them to stick to their treaties with their opponents. 
  - This was what the Arab Jews practiced, declaring: There is no moral obligation on us in regard to the pagan Arabs, and we are rightly entitled to practice dishonesty and deceit that might be of advantage to us and harmful to the disbelievers.

## AYat 93

- `Had Allah so willed, He would have made you all one single community.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This further supports the previous warning. It means that it would be wrong for any champion of Allah’s religion to arrogate to himself the use of every sort of method and means irrespective of whether they are right or wrong to propagate his own religion (considering it to be Allah’s religion) and try to destroy opposite religions.
    - For this would be utterly against the will of Allah.
    - If Allah had willed that there should be no religious differences, He could have deprived mankind of the freedom of choice. In that case, there would have been no need for Allah to get help of any such upholder of His religion, who uses disgraceful means for this purpose.
    - Allah could have created all mankind to be inherent believers and obedient servants by depriving them of the power and option of disbelief and sin. Then there would have been none who could have dared to deviate from belief and obedience.
- `However, He lets go astray whomsoever He wills and shows the Right Way to whomsoever He wills.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is to show that Allah Himself has given man the power and freedom to follow any out of the many ways. That is why Allah makes arrangements for the guidance of the one who intends to follow the right way, and let go astray the one who desires to deviate.
- `Surely you shall be called to account regarding what you did.`

## Ayat 94

- `Do not make your oaths a means of deceiving one another or else your foot may slip after having been firm,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, someone who might have been convinced of Islam, seeing your dishonest conduct should become disgusted and hold back from joining the believers. For he might argue like this: As these Muslims are not much different from the disbelievers in their morals and dealings, there is no reason why I should join them.
- `and you may suffer evil consequences because of hindering people from the way of Allah.`
- `A mighty chastisement awaits you.`

## Ayat 95

- `Do not barter away the covenant of Allah`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the covenant that you may make in the name of Allah as a representative of His religion.
- `for a paltry gain.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It does not mean that they should barter away Allah’s covenant for some big gain. What it implies is that any worldly gain howsoever great is insignificant as compared with the worth of Allah’s covenant. Therefore, it will be a losing bargain to barter that away for any worldly gain, which is after all paltry.
- `Verily that which is with Allah is far better for you, if you only knew.`

## Ayat 96

- `Whatever you have is bound to pass away and whatever is with Allah will last.`
- `And We shall surely grant those who have been patient their reward1`
- `according to the best of what they did.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Those who practice fortitude are the people who will always stand firm in the struggle between right and truth on one side and greed and lust on the other.
  - They bear every loss for the sake of righteousness and spurn away every gain that they might obtain by adopting unlawful means. They patiently wait for the rewards of their good deeds in the Hereafter.

## Ayat 97

- `Whosoever acts righteously - whether a man or a woman - and embraces belief, We will surely grant him a good life;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This verse removes the wrong notions of both the Muslims and the disbelievers who are of the opinion that those who adopt a just honest and pious attitude, are most surely losers in this world, though they might be gainers in the Hereafter.
    - Allah removes this misunderstanding, as if to say: This presumption of yours is wrong. The righteous attitude not only leads to a happy life in the Hereafter, but it also guarantees, by Allah’s grace, a pure and happy life even in this world. And this is a fact that those people who are sincerely righteous, honest, pure and fair in their dealings enjoy a much better life in this world. For they enjoy that confidence and real honor and respect because of their spotless character, which is not enjoyed by those who lack these virtues. They obtain such pure and outstanding success as are denied to those who employ dirty and disgusting ways to win success. Above all, they enjoy, even though they might be living in poor houses, that peace of mind and satisfaction of conscience which is denied to the wicked dwellers of mansions and palaces.
- `and will surely grant such persons their reward according to the best of their deeds.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, their rank in the Hereafter shall be determined according to their best deeds. In other words, if a person has done both small and great virtues, he will be awarded that high rank which he would merit according to his greatest virtues.

## Ayat 98

- `Whenever you read the Qur'an seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the accursed.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This does not mean that one should merely repeat the Arabic words: I seek Allah’s refuge against the accursed Satan.
  - It means that one should have a sincere desire and do his utmost to guard against Satan’s evil suggestions when one is reciting the Holy Quran and should not allow wrong and irrelevant doubts and suspicions to enter his mind.
  - One should try to see everything contained in the Quran in its true light, and refrain from mixing it up with his self invented theories or ideas foreign to the Quran so as to construe its meaning against the will of Allah.
  - Moreover, one should feel that the most sinister and avowed design of Satan is that the reader should not obtain any guidance from the Quran. This is why Satan tries his utmost to delude the reader and pervert him from getting guidance from it, and mislead him into wrong ways of thinking.
  - Therefore, the reader should be fully on his guard against Satan and seek Allah’s refuge for help so that Satan should not be able to deprive him of the benefits froth this source of guidance, for one who fails to get guidance from this source, will never be able to get guidance from anywhere else. Above all, the one who seeks to obtain deviation from this Book is so entangled in deviation that he can never get out of this vicious circle.

## Ayat 99

- `Surely he has no power over those who have faith and who place their trust in their Lord.`

## Ayat 100

- `He has power only over those who take him as their patron and who, under his influence, associate others with Allah in His Divinity.`
