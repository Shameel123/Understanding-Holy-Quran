**Ayat 61 - 65**

## Ayat 61

- `Were Allah to take people to task for their wrong-doing, He would not have spared even a single living creature on the face of the earth.`
- `But He grants them respite until an appointed term.`
- `And when that term arrives, they have no power to delay it by a single moment, nor to hasten it.`

## Ayat 62

- `They assign to Allah what they dislike for themselves and`
- `their tongues utter a sheer lie in stating that a happy state awaits them.`
- `Without doubt the Fire awaits them and it is to it that they shall be hastened.`

## Ayat 63

- `By Allah, (O Muhammad), We sent Messengers to other communities before you but Satan made their evil deeds attractive to them (so they paid no heed to the call of the Messengers).`
- `The same Satan is their patron today and they are heading towards a painful chastisement.`

## Ayat 64

- `We have sent down the Book that you may explain to them the truth concerning what they are disputing`
- `and that the Book may serve as a guidance and mercy for those who believe in it.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, this Book has afforded them an excellent opportunity to resolve their differences which have been caused by the superstitious creeds of their forefathers, and which have divided, them into warring factions.
  - They can then unite on the permanent basis of the truth presented by the Quran, but those foolish people preferring their former condition even after the coming of this blessing, shall meet with disgrace and torment.
  - On the other hand, only those, who believe in this Book, will find the right way and blessed with mercy and favors from Allah.

## Ayat 65

- `Allah sends down water from the heaven, and thereby He instantly revives the earth after it lay dead.`
- `Verily there is a sign in it for those who have ears.`
