**Ayat 84 - 89**

## Ayat 84

- `(They are heedless of) the Day when We shall raise a witness from each community`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The witness will be the Prophet of that community or his follower who invited that community to Tauhid and God worship and warned it of the consequences of shirk and superstitious rites and customs and cautioned it against the accountability on the Day of Resurrection. He will bear witness of the fact that he had conveyed the true message to those people, and that they committed evils deliberately and not in ignorance.
- `and then the unbelievers will neither be allowed to plead nor will they be asked to repent and seek pardon.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This does not mean that the criminals will not be given any opportunity to clear themselves but it means that their crimes will be proved to the hilt by means of irrefutable evidence which will leave no room for excuses.

## Ayat 85

- `Once the wrong-doers have beheld the chastisement, neither will it be lightened for them nor will they be granted any respite.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, they will not be given the opportunity to beg pardon of their Lord for their crimes. For that will be the time of judgment as the time of begging pardon would have ended long before this.
  - **The Quran and the traditions are explicit on this point that the place for penitence is this world and not the next world.**
  - Even in this world the opportunity is lost as soon as signs of death begin to appear, for the penitence at that time will be of no avail when a person knows that the time of his death has come.
  - Respite for deeds expires as soon as one enters into the boundary of death, and the only thing that remains after that is the award of reward and punishment.

## Ayat 86

- `And when those who associated others with Allah in His Divinity will see those to whom they ascribed this share, they will say:`
  - `"Our Lord! These are the beings to whom we ascribed a share in Your Divinity and whom we called upon instead of You,"`
- `whereupon those beings will fling at them the words:`
  - `"You are liars."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It does not mean that they would deny the fact that the mushriks used to invoke their help. They will call them liars in the sense that they had made them deities without their knowledge, information and permission, as if to say: We never told you to leave Allah aside and pray to us for help. As a matter of fact, we never approved of this. Nay, we were utterly unaware of this that you were invoking us. It was an utter lie that you considered us to be able to hear your prayers, answer them and help you out of your difficulties. As you yourselves were responsible for this shirk, why are you involving us in its consequences?


## Ayat 87

- `On that Day they will offer their submission and all that they had fabricated will have vanished.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, all those things on which they had relied will prove to be false, for they will not find anyone to hear their supplication nor anyone to remove their hardships.
  - Nay, there will be none who will come forward and say: These are my dependents, so no action should be taken against them.

## Ayat 88

- `As for those who disbelieved and barred others from the way of Allah,`
- `We shall add further chastisement to their chastisement for all the mischief they did.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “We will increase punishment over punishment”: one for their own disbelief and the other for hindering others from the Way of Allah.

## Ayat 89

- `(O Muhammad), warn them of the coming of a Day when We shall bring forth a witness against them from each community and We shall bring you forth as a witness against them all;`
- `(and it is for that purpose that) We sent down the Book to you which makes everything clear,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The Quran makes manifest everything on which depends guidance or deviation, success or failure. Whose knowledge is essential for following the right way. What clearly distinguishes truth from falsehood.
- `and serves as a guidance and mercy and glad tidings to those who have submitted to Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In this connection one should guard against that meaning of this sentence and the like in the Quran according to which some people interpret “everything” to mean the knowledge of all sciences, arts, etc. and in order to prove the correctness of their interpretation, they have to pervert the real meaning of the Quran.
