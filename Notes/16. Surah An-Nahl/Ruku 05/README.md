**Ayat 35 - 40**

## Ayat 35

- `Those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity say:`
  - `"Were Allah to will so, neither we nor our forefathers would have worshipped any other than Him, nor would we have prohibited anything without His command."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - In order to understand the significance of this argument the reader should keep in view(Ayats 148-150 and E.N.s 124-126 of Surah Al-Anaam), for this has been cited and answered there.
- `Their predecessors proffered similar excuses.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, your argument is not a new one but the same old one which had always been offered by erroneous people who went before you. 
    - Today you are, like them, excusing yourselves for your deviation and evil conduct, saying that it is the will of God. You know that this is a lame excuse that has been invented to delude yourselves, and to escape from admonition.
- `Do the Messengers have any other duty but to plainly convey the Message?`

## Ayat 36

- `We raised a Messenger in every community (to tell them):`
  - `"Serve Allah and shun the Evil One."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, you are not justified in excusing yourselves for these sins, saying that it is the will of God for We sent Messengers to every ummat, who told the people in plain words that they should worship Us and none else, and should not follow and obey taghut. 
      - Besides this, We have already warned you that We do not approve of your deviations. Why should you then put forward this excuse for your deviations? Do you mean to say that We ought to have sent such Messengers as would have forced you to follow the right way instead of bringing you to it by preaching? Please refer to (E.N. 80 of Surah Al-Anaam) for the distinction between God’s will and God’s approval).
- `Thereafter Allah guided some of them while others were overtaken by error.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Whenever a Messenger came to a people, they were divided into two groups.
- `Go about the earth, then, and observe what was the end of those who rejected the Messengers, calling them liars.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - (1) Those who accepted the message (and that, too, could not have been possible except with the will of Allah).

## Ayat 37

- `(O Muhammad), howsoever eager you may be to show them the Right Way, Allah does not bestow His guidance on those whom He lets go astray; and in fact none will be able to help them.`

## Ayat 38

- `They swear most solemnly in the name of Allah and say:`
  - `"Allah shall not raise to life any who dies."`
- `(Yes, He will do so);`
- `that is a promise by which He is bound, even though most people do not know that.`

## Ayat 39

- `(That is bound to happen in order that)`
- `He may make clear to them the reality regarding the matters on which they differ`
- `and that the unbelievers may realize that they were liars.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In (Ayat 39 )those two things have been stated which rationally and morally require that there must be Resurrection and life after death, that is:

## Ayat 40

- `(As for the possibility of resurrection, bear in mind that)`
- `whenever We do will something,`
- `We have to do no more than say:`
  - `"Be",`
- `and it is.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the answer to those who imagined that it was the most difficult thing to raise the dead, and that, too, to raise together at once all the people who had died at any time.
  - They have been told that it is an easy thing for Allah, Who has the power to bring into existence anything He desires, merely by His command, “Be,” for He does not stand in need of any provisions, any means and any favorable environment for this.
  - His mere command produces necessary provisions, means and environment.
  - This world was brought into existence by His mere command, “Be,” and likewise the next world will at once come into existence by His single command.
