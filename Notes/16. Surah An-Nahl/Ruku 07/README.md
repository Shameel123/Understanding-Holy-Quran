**Ayat 51 - 60**

## Ayat 51

- `Allah has commanded:`
  - `"Do not take two gods;`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - Negation of two gods by itself negates the existence of more than two gods.
  - `for He is but One God`
  - `So fear Me alone."`

## Ayat 52

- `His is whatever is in the heavens and the earth,`
- `and obedience to Him inevitably pervades the whole universe.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In other words it means that the entire system of the universe exists on its obedience to Him.
- `Will you, then, hold in awe any other than Allah?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, when it is so, will you then make the fear of any other than God the basis of the system of your life?

## Ayat 53

- `Every bounty that you enjoy is from Allah;`
- `and whenever any misfortune strikes you, it is to Him that you cry for the removal of your distress.`

- Tahim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the fact, that you run to Allah for help in your distress and not to anyone else, is a clear proof of he Oneness of Allah, which has been embedded in your own hearts. At the time of your affliction, your true nature, which had been suppressed by the gods you had forged, involuntarily comes to the surface and invokes Allah, for it knows no other god or lord or master, having any real power. (For further details please refer to (E.Ns 29 and 41 of Surah Al-Anaam).

## Ayat 54

- `But as soon as He removes the distress from you, some of you associate others with their Lord in giving thanks,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, at the time of showing gratitude to Allah for removing his affliction, he begins to make offerings also to some god, goddess or saint to show that Allahâ€™s kindness to him was due to the intercession of his patron, for he imagines that otherwise Allah would not have removed his distress.

## Ayat 55

- `that they may show ingratitude for the bounties We bestowed upon them.`
- `So enjoy yourselves for a while, soon you will come to know (the truth).`

## Ayat 56

- `They set apart for those, whose reality they do not even know, a portion of the sustenance We have provided them.`
- `By Allah, you will surely be called to account for the lies that you have invented!`

## Ayat 57

- `They assign daughters to Allah`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This refers to a tradition of the ancient Arabs. They regarded their goddesses and angels as daughters of God.
- `- glory be to Him - whereas they assign to themselves what they truly desire!`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This refers to a tradition of the ancient Arabs. They regarded their goddesses and angels as daughters of God.

## Ayat 58

- `When any of them is told about the birth of a female his face turns dark, and he is filled with suppressed anger,`

## Ayat 59

- `and he hides himself from people because of the bad news, thinking: should he keep the child despite disgrace, or should he bury it in dust?`
- `How evil is their estimate of Allah!`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:

  - This attitude of contempt towards daughters has been mentioned to bring home to them the height of their folly, ignorance and impudence in regard to God. This is why they did not hesitate to assign daughters to Allah, though they themselves felt that to have daughters was a matter of disgrace for them. Besides this, it shows that they had a very low estimation of Allah, which had resulted from their ways of shirk. So they felt nothing wrong in ascribing such foolish and absurd things to Allah Who is above such things.

  ## Ayat 60

  - `Those who do not believe in the Hereafter deserve to be characterized with evil attributes whereas Allah's are the most excellent attributes.`
  - `He is the Most Mighty, the Most Wise.`
