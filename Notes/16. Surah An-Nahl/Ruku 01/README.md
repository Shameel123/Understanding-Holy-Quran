**Ayat 01 - 09**

## Ayat 01

- `Allah's judgement has (all but) come;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the time for final judgment has come near.
    - As regards to the use of the past tense in the original, this may be to show certainty of its occurrence in the near future or to emphasize the fact that the rebellion and the wrong deeds of the Quraish had become so unbearable that they warranted that the time for decisive action had come.
- `do not, then, call for its speedy advent.`
- `Holy is He,`
- `and far above their associating others with Him in His Divinity.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Here question arises as to what that judgment was and how it came.
    - We are of the opinion (and true knowledge is with Allah alone) that that judgment was hijra (the migration) of the Prophet (peace be upon him) from Makkah.
    - For a short time after this revelation, he was bidden to emigrate from there.
    - And according to the Quran, a Prophet (peace be upon him) is bidden to leave his place only at that time when the rebellion and antagonism of his people reaches the extreme limit. Then their doom is sealed, for after this Allah’s punishment comes on them either as a direct scourge from Him, or they are destroyed by the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his followers. **And this did actually take place.**
    - At the occasion of the migration, the people of Makkah regarded it as a victory for themselves, but in fact it turned out to be a defeat for shirk and disbelief which were totally uprooted within a decade or so after the migration, not only from Makkah but from the rest of Arabia as well.


## Ayat 02

- `He sends down this spirit(of prophecy) by His command through His angels`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This means the Spirit of Prophethood with which a Prophet is imbued in order to fulfill his mission by word and deed.
    - The Quran has called this the Spirit in several places, for this has the same relation to the mission of a Prophet and his moral life, which the soul has to the physical human life.
- `on any of His servants whom He wills,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - As one of the things, which prompted the disbelievers to challenge the Prophet (peace be upon him) for scourge, was their presumption that he was not a true Prophet.
    - Allah told them categorically that he was a true Prophet who had been imbued with the Spirit which We had sent down on him.
- `(directing them):`
  - `"Warn people that there is no deity but Me; so hold Me alone in fear."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - “Spirit of His command, upon whom He wills.”
      - This is the answer to the objections which the chiefs of the Quraish used to raise against the Prophet (peace be upon him): Had Allah wanted to send a Messenger to them, was there no one better than Muhammad (peace be upon him), son of Abdullah, for this mission.
      - Why did He not choose one of the big chiefs of Makkah or Taif for the purpose? 
      - Such absurd objections needed no other answer than this that is why such an answer has been given in several places of the Quran as if to say:
        - **Allah knows best how to do His work, and does not stand in need of any advice from you. He chooses for His mission anyone whom He considers fit for it.**

## Ayat 03

- `He created the heavens and the earth with Truth.`
- `Exalted is He above whatever they associate with Allah in His Divinity.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is to say, the entire system of the earth and the heavens is a witness to the truth of the doctrine of Tauhid and to the negation of shirk.
    - You may look at anything in the universe and consider the system from any point of view you like, you will find proof of this fact that it is being run by one God and not by many gods.
    - Then how is it that you believe in shirk when there is no proof whatsoever of this in the universe As a fitting sequence of this, proofs of Tauhid and refutation of shirk have been given from man himself and from other signs in the universe, and it has also been shown that Prophethood is based on truth.

## Ayat 04

- `He created man out of a mere drop of fluid,`
- `and lo! he turned into an open wrangler.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This has two meanings and both are meant here.

## Ayat 05

- `He created the cattle.`
- `They are a source of clothing and food`
- `and also a variety of other benefits for you.`

## Ayat 06

- `And you find beauty in them as you`
  - `drive them to pasture in the morning`
  - `and as you drive them back home in the evening;`

## Ayat 07

- `and they carry your loads to many a place which you would be unable to reach without much hardship.`
- **`Surely your Lord is Intensely Loving, Most Merciful.`**

## Ayat 08

- `And He created horses and mules and asses for you to ride, and also for your adornment.`
- **`And He creates many things (for you) that you do not even know about.`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, there are many agencies which are working for the good of man but he is quite unaware of such servants and the services rendered by them.

## Ayat 09

- `It rests with Allah alone to show you the Right Way,`
- `even when there are many crooked ways.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This contains an argument for Prophethood along with a proof of Tauhid and of Allah’s compassion and providence. The argument is this:
- `Had He so willed, He would have (perforce) guided you all aright.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - There are many divergent ways of thought and action open for man to choose from. 
    - Obviously all these divergent ways cannot be straight ways, because there can be only one straight way; therefore, there can be only one right theory of life which is based on that way, and only one right way of life which is based on that right theory.
    - Thus it is clear that the choice of the right way of life is man’s most important and basic need, for its wrong choice would inevitably lead to his ruin. This is because all other things fulfill his animal needs only, but this is the greatest necessity of his life as a human being and without its fulfillment his life would be an utter failure.
