**Ayat 120 - 128**

## Ayat 120

- `Indeed Abraham was a whole community by himself,1`
- `obedient to Allah,`
- `exclusively devoted to Him.`
- `And he was never one of those who associated others with Allah in His Divinity.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Abraham was a whole community by himself” for at that time he was the only Muslim in the whole world who was upholding the banner of Islam, while the rest of the world was upholding the banner of unbelief.
  - As that servant of Allah performed the mission which is ordinarily carried out by a whole community, he was not one person but an institution in himself.

## Ayat 121

- `He rendered thanks to Allah for His bounties so that Allah chose him (for His favours) and directed him to the Right Way.`

## Ayat 122

- `We bestowed good upon him in this world,`
- `and in the Hereafter he shall certainly be among the righteous.`

## Ayat 123

- `Then We revealed to you:`
  - `"Follow the way of Abraham with exclusive devotion to Allah.`
  - `He was not one of those who associated others with Allah in His Divinity."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the complete answer to the first objection (E.N. 117) raised by the disbelievers. This has two parts.

## Ayat 124

- `Certainly your Lord will judge on the Day of Resurrection between them regarding the matters they disputed.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is the answer to their second objection. Obviously, there was no need to state that the restrictions about the Sabbath applied only to the Jews and had nothing to do with the law of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him), because they themselves knew it.
  - The restrictions were imposed upon the Jews because of their mischief and violations of the law.
  - In order to understand fully the significance of this reference one is requested to read those passages of the Bible in which commandments about the Sabbath have been stated, e.g., Exodus 20: 8-11, 23: 12-13,31: 1-17, 35: 23, and Numbers 15: 32-36.
  - Besides this, one should also be acquainted with the impudent violations of the Sabbath. See Jeremiah: 17: 21-27 and Ezekiel. 10: 18-24.

## Ayat 125

- `(O Prophet), call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This instruction is very important for those who are engaged in the propagation of Islam. They should always keep in view two things, wisdom and excellent admonition.
    - Wisdom implies that one should use discretion in the work of propagation and should not do this blindly like foolish people. 
    - Wisdom demands that one should keep in view the intelligence, capability and circumstances of the addressees and convey the message in accordance with the requirements of the occasion. 
    - Moreover, one should refrain from applying one and the same method to each and every person or group but should first diagnose the real disease of the addressee and then cure it by appealing to his mind and intellect.
- `and reason with them in the best manner possible.`
- `Surely your Lord knows best who has strayed away from His path,`
- `and He also knows well those who are guided to the Right Way.`

## Ayat 126

- `If you take retribution, then do so in proportion to the wrong done to you.`
- `But if you can bear such conduct with patience, indeed that is best for the steadfast.`

## Ayat 127

- `And bear with patience, (O Muhammad)`
- `- and your patience is only because of the help of Allah -`
- `and do not grieve over them, nor feel distressed by their evil plans.`

## Ayat 128

- `For surely Allah is with those who hold Him in fear and do good.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Allah is with those who fear Him” because they scrupulously refrain from evil ways and always adopt the righteous attitude, for they know that their actions and deeds are not determined by the evils others do to them but by their own sense of righteousness; so they return good for evil.
