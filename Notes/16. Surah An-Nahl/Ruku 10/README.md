**Ayat 71 - 76**

## Ayat 71

- `Allah has favoured some of you with more worldly provisions than others.`
- `Then those who are more favoured do not give away their provisions to their slaves lest they become equal sharers in it.`
- `Do they, then, deny the favour of Allah?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It will be worthwhile to give deep thought to the meanings of this verse, for some modern commentators of the Quran have founded strange economic theories and systems on it.
  - Their interpretation is an instance of perverting the meaning of the Quran by isolating verses from their context and treating it as a separate whole in order to formulate a new philosophy and law of Islamic Economics.
  - In their opinion the verse implies this: Those people to whom Allah has given more provisions than others, should share these equally with their servants and slaves: otherwise they shall be guilty of ingratitude to Allah in regard to the wealth with which He had blessed them.
  - This commentary on the verse is obviously wrong and farfetched because in the context it occurs there is no mention at all of any law of economics.
  - The whole passage in which this verse occurs deals with the refutation of shirk and proof of Tauhid. The same themes are continued in the subsequent verses. There seems to be no reason why an economic law should have been inserted here, which would have been absolutely irrelevant, to say the least.
  - On the contrary, when the verse is considered in its context, it becomes quite obvious that it is no more than the statement of a fact to prove the same theme that is contained in this passage. It argues like this: When you yourselves do not make your servants and slaves equal partners in your wealth, which in fact is given to you by Allah, how is it that you join other gods with God in your gratitude to Him for the favors with which He has blessed you. You know that these gods have no powers to bestow anything on anyone, and, therefore, have no right in your worship of Allah, for they are after all His slaves and servants.

## Ayat 72

- `And Allah has given you spouses from your kind,`
- `and has granted you through your spouses, sons and grandsons, and has provided you wholesome things as sustenance.`
- `(After knowing all this), do they still believe in falsehood`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Is then in falsehood that they believe”: they have this false and baseless belief that there are certain gods and goddesses, jinns and saints, dead and alive, who possess the power to make or mar their fates, fulfill their desires and answer their prayers, give them children, cure their diseases and help them win law suits.
- `and deny Allah's bounty,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “In the bounty of Allah that they disbelieve”: by associating others with Allah in offering gratitude to Him for His favors, though they did not have any proof or authority that their false gods had played any part in regard to those favors.
    - The Quran considers such an association to be the denial of Allah’s favors. It puts forward the fundamental principle: It is the denial of the favor of the real benefactor to offer gratitude for his favor to anyone who has not done that favor, or to presume without any proof or reason that the real benefactor has nor granted that favor of his own accord but because of the mediation or regard or recommendation or intercession of this or that person.

## Ayat 73

- `and worship instead of Allah,`
- `those helpless beings who have no control over providing them any sustenance from the heavens and the earth;` 
- `do you worship those who have no power to do anything of this sort?`

## Ayat 74

- `So do not strike any similitudes to Allah.`
- `Allah knows whereas you do not know.`

 - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “So do not make up any similitude for Allah”: You should not compare Allah with others nor consider Him to be unapproachable like worldly kings and rulers, to whom none can have access without the mediation and intercession of their courtiers and servants. As Allah is not surrounded by angels, saints, favorites, etc. everyone can have direct access to Him without mediation by anyone. 7


## Ayat  75

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In the preceding verse, the mushriks were told not to make comparisons between Allah and His creatures, for there is nothing like Him. As the bases of their comparison were wrong, their conclusions were also misleading. In this verse appropriate similitude have been cited and right comparisons have been made to lead them to reality.


- `Allah sets forth a parable:`
- `There is one who is a slave and is owned by another and has no power over anything;`
- `and there is one whom We have granted good provision Ourselves, of which he spends both secretly and openly.`
- `Can they be equal?`
- `All praise be to Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Between the last question and “Praise be to Allah” there is a gap which is to be filled with the help of the latter. When the question was posed, obviously the mushriks could not say that the two men were equal. So some of them would have admitted that they were not equal, while the others would have kept quiet for fear that in case of admission, they would have to abide by its logical conclusion, that is, the admission of refutation of the doctrine of shirk.
    - Therefore, the words, **“Praise be to Allah”** have been put in the mouth of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in answer to both kinds of the response to the question. 
    - In the first case, it would mean: “Praise be to Allah” you have admitted at least so much. In the second case, it would mean: “Praise be to Allah” you have kept quiet in spite of all your obduracy and have not had the audacity to say that both were equal.
- `But most of them do not even know (this simple fact).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “But most of them do not know” this simple thing that while they feel and carefully observe the distinction between those who have powers and those who are powerless, they neither feel nor observe the clear distinction between the Creator and His creation.
    - That is why they associate the creatures with the Creator in His Attributes and Powers and show the kind of allegiance to them as is the exclusive right of the Creator. The pity is that in their everyday life, they would beg for some thing from the master of the house and not from the servants but in contrast to this, they would beg for their needs from the servants of Allah and not from Him.


## Ayat 76

- `Allah sets forth another parable:`
- `There are two men, one of whom is dumb and has no power over anything; he is a burden to his master, and wheresoever his master directs him, he fails to bring forth any good.`
- `Can such a person be the equal1 of one who enjoins justice and himself follows the Right Way?`
