**Ayat 64 - 69**

## Ayat 64

- `The present life is nothing but sport and amusement.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is “The reality of it is no more than the children’s engaging in a sport and pastime for a while, and then returning home. The one has become a king here, has not become a king in reality but is only playing the king. A time comes when his play ends, and he leaves the royal throne as empty-handed as he was when he had entered the world. Similarly, no phase of life here is enduring and lasting. Every one is playing his part only temporarily for a limited time. Those who are charmed by the short-lived triumphs of this life and are able to collect some means of enjoyment and pleasure and of glory and grandeur by losing their conscience and faith, are only engaged in a pastime. What will these toys profit them when after amusing themselves with these for some years in the world, they will enter through the gate of death empty handed into the next world of eternal life and find their same allurements to have caused them an everlasting affliction?”
- `The true life is in the Abode of the Hereafter; if only they knew.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “If these people had known the reality that the life of this world is only a period of preparation for the test, and the real life for man, which is everlasting, is the life Hereafter, they would not have wasted this preparatory period in sport and merry making, but would instead have utilized each moment of it in works conducive to better results in the eternal life of the Hereafter.”


## Ayat 65
 
- `When they embark in the ships they call upon Allah, consecrating their faith to Him.`
- `But when He rescues them and brings them to land, they suddenly begin to associate others with Allah in His Divinity`

I think, This could mean that whenever we are in hardship then we call to Allah SWT but when Allah SWT removes it, we forget and either put the appreciation on us that we ourselves got out of it or try to give the appreciation to someone else.

## Ayat 66

- `that they may be ungrateful for the rescue that We granted them,`
- `and that they may revel in the pleasures (of the present life).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - For explanation, see (E.Ns 29 and41 of Surah AlAnaam); (E.Ns 29 and 31 of Surah Yunus) and (E.N. 84 of Surah Bani Israil).
- `Soon they shall come to know.`

## Ayat 67

- `Do they not see that We have given them a sanctuary of safety whereas people around them are being snatched away?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, if the city of Makkah, in whose surroundings they enjoy perfect safety and security, had been made a sacred place by some Lat or Hubal, was it possible for a god or goddess to have secured this place against all sorts of mischief and violence for 2,500 years or so, in a striferidden land like Arabia? Who could then keep and maintain its sacredness and sanctity except Us?
- `So, do they believe in falsehood and ungratefully deny Allah's bounties?`

## Ayat 68

- `Who can be more unjust than he who foists a lie on Allah or gives the lie to the Truth after it has come to him?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “The Prophet (peace be upon him) has made a claim to prophethood, and you have denied him. Now there can be only two alternatives: If the Prophet (peace be upon him) has made a false claim in the name of Allah, there can be no one more wicked than him, and if you have belied a true Prophet (peace be upon him), there can be no one more wicked than you.”
- `Is Hell not the resort of the unbelievers?`

## Ayat 69

- `As for those who strive in Our cause, We shall surely guide them to Our Ways.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word mujahadah has already been explained in (E.N: 8) above. There it was said that a person who exerts will exert for his own good (Ayat 6). Here it is being reassured that Allah does not leave alone those who strive in His cause sincerely, even at the risk of a conflict with the entire world, but He helps and guides them and opens for them ways towards Himself. He teaches them at every step the way of winning His approval and goodwill and He shows them the light at every turning point to discriminate between the right way and the wrong ways of life. In short, Allah helps and succors and guides them according to their sincerity and intensity of desire for goodness.
- `Indeed Allah is with those who do good.`
