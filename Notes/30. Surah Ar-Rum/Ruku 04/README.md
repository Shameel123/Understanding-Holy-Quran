**Ayat 28 - 40**

## Ayat 28

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In the forgoing section, arguments have been given both for Tauhid and for the Hereafter; now the discourse turns to only Tauhid.

- `He sets forth for you a parable from your own lives.`
- `Do you have among your slaves some who share with you the sustenance that We have bestowed on you so that you become equals in it, all being alike, and then you would hold them in fear as you fear each other?`
- `Thus do We make plain the Signs for those who use reason.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The mushriks, even after admitting that Allah is the Creator and Master of the earth and heavens and all that they contain, held some of His creatures as associates in His attributes and powers, and prayed to them, presented offerings and performed rites of worship before them. Their belief regarding their self-made associates is found in the words of the Talbih that they used to pronounce while going round the Kabah. They said: “Here I am, O Allah, here I am in Thy presence! Thou hast no partner except the partner who is Thy own. Thou art his owner as well as owner of what he owns.” (Tabarani on the authority of Ibn Abbas). Allah has refuted this kind of shirk in this verse. The argument is to this effect: “When you do not make your own slaves partners in your wealth, how do you think and believe that Allah will make His creatures partners in His Godhead?” (See (E.N. 62 of Surah An-Nahl)).

## Ayat 29

- `But the wrong-doers follow their desires without any knowledge.`
- **`Who, then, can show the way to him whom Allah lets go astray?`**
- `Such shall have no helpers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, when a person neither thinks on the right way by himself, nor is prepared to listen to a well-wisher, his intellect comes under the curse of Allah. After this everything that can help reasonable person to reach the truth, only helps this stubborn and ignorant person to be involved more and more deeply in further deviation and error. This is what has been conveyed in the word “sending astray”.
  - When a truth-loving person invokes Allah for the grace of guidance, Allah creates for him maximum means of the guidance according to the sincerity of his invocation. And when a strayed person insists on his deviation, Allah creates for him the means which mislead him further and further away from the truth.”

## Ayat 30

- `(O Prophet and his followers),`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This “so” implies that when the reality has become clear to you, and you have come to know that none but Allah is the Creator and Master and Sovereign of this universe and of man himself, then inevitably your conduct should be such as indicated in this verse.
- `turn your face singlemindedly`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Set your face...truth”: Do not turn your face to any other direction after you have adopted this way of life. Then you should think like a Muslim and your likes and dislikes should be of a Muslim. Your values and standards should be the ones set by Islam and your character and conduct should bear the stamp of Islam, and the affairs of your individual and collective life should be ordered according to the way taught by Islam.
- `to the true Faith`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “This faith”: The faith that the Quran presents, in which none but Allah is worthy of worship and obedience, in which none can be held as an associate of Allah in His Divinity, in His attributes and His powers and rights, in which man by his own free will chooses to order his life in accordance with the guidance and law of Allah.
- `and adhere to the true nature on which Allah has created human beings.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, all human beings have been created on the nature that none but One Allah is their Creator and Lord and Deity. You should be steadfast on this nature. If you adopt the attitude of independence, you will be following a way opposed to your nature, and if you serve and worship another besides Allah, then you will be working against your nature.”
- `The mould fashioned by Allah cannot be altered.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This subject has been explained by the Prophet (peace be upon him) in a number of Ahadith. According to Bukhari and Muslim, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: **“Every child who is born, is born on the human nature; it is his parents who make him a Jew or a Christian or a Magian, etc. afterwards. Its example is that of an animal which gives birth to complete and sound young ones, none is born with torn and cut off ears, but the mushriks tear their ears afterwards on account of their superstitions of ignorance.”**
- `That is the True, Straight Faith,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - According to another Hadith reported in Musnad Ahmad and Nasai, the Muslims in a war killed the children of the enemy. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) came to know of it, he became very angry, and said: **“What has happened to the people that they have transgressed the limits and killed even the children?”** A man said, **“Were they not the children of the Mushriks?”** The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: **“Even the best of your people are the children of the mushriks!”** Then he said: **“Every living being is born on the nature: then when he becomes able to speak, his parents turn him into a Jew or a Christian.”**
- `although most people do not know.`


## Ayat 31

- `(Adhere to the True Faith and) turn to Him,` 
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, whoever has adopted an attitude of independence and freedom and turned away from his true Lord, and whoever has adopted service of another than Allah and proved to be disloyal to his real and true Lord, should desist from this, and return to the service of the One God Whose real servant is he by birth.
- `and hold Him in awe,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, you should have the fear that if in spite of being a servant of Allah by birth, you adopted the way of living independent of Him, or served another beside Him, you will have to suffer a severe punishment for rebellion and ingratitude. Therefore, you should avoid every such way of life which earns you the wrath of God.
- `and establish Prayer,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - **Both turning to Allah and having fear of His wrath are the acts of the heart.**
    - This state of the heart, for its manifestation and stability, inevitably needs a physical act, which they make it known to others in society that so and so has really returned to the service of One Allah alone, and which, at the same time, may go on nourishing and developing the state of piety and devotion in his own self by means of practical experience and discipline.
    - **That is why immediately after giving the command for a mental change Allah has given the command for this physical act, i.e. establishment of the Salat.**
    - As long as an idea is only an idea in the mind of man, it can neither be stable nor enduring.
    - It may fade away or even change.
    - But when he starts practicing it, the idea takes root in him and goes on increasing in stability and strength with more and more practice;
      - so much so that when it has become a belief it can neither change nor fade away easily.
    - **Considered from this viewpoint, no act can be more effective than the offering of the Prayer regularly five times a day for strengthening piety and fear of God in oneself.**
    - The other act, whatever it be, is carried out at intervals, or in different forms on different occasions, but the Prayer is an act, which is performed every few hours in one and the same specific form permanently, in which man has to rehearse over and over again the whole lesson taught him by the Quran about Islam, so that he does not forget it.
    - Furthermore, both the believers and the disbelievers have to know who among the people has given up the way of rebellion and adopted the way of obedience to the Lord.
    - The believers have to know this so that they can form into a community and society and can cooperate with one another in the way of Allah; then as soon as the relationship of any one of them starts showing signs of laxity with respect to the faith and Islam, this should become known to all of them at once. The disbelievers have to know this so that the dormant nature in them wakens up when they see the people from their own kith and kin turning humbly to their real God over and over again, and till their nature wakes up they continue to be awe-stricken when they see the practical enthusiasm of the obedient servants of God.
      - For these two objectives the establishment of the Prayer is the most effective means.
- `and do not be of those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity,`


## Ayat 32

- `those who have split up their religion and have become divided into sects, each party exulting in what they have.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is an allusion to the fact that the real way of life for mankind is the same way of nature as elucidated above. This way of life has not evolved from a polytheistic creed to Tauhid as thought by those who invent a philosophy of religion on the basis of speculation. But, contrary to this, all the religions found in the world today have appeared because of the corruption of the original way of life. This corruption occurred because different people added their different self made creeds to the natural realities and created separate sects and everyone became a devotee of the additional thing, which was the basis of the separate sect, and gave up the original way of life. Now the only way of attaining true guidance is that one should return to the original reality which was the basis of the true faith, and rid oneself of all the later additions and excrescences and their devotees. If he still keeps any kind of contact with them, he will only be harming the true faith.

## Ayat 33

- `(Such are human beings) that when any misfortune befalls them, they cry to their Lord, penitently turning to Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is a clear proof of the fact that in the depths of their heart there still exists an evidence of Tauhid. Whenever the hopes start crumbling, their hearts cry out from within that the real Ruler of the universe is its Master and His help alone can improve their lot.
- `But no sooner that He lets them have a taste of His Mercy than some of them begin associating others with their Lord in His Divinity`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they again start presenting offerings before other deities, and claiming that their misfortune has been removed through the help and grace of such and such a saint and shrine.

## Ayat 34

- `so that they may show ingratitude to Us for the favours We had bestowed upon them. So, enjoy yourselves a while; but then you shall soon come to know.`

## Ayat 35

- `Have We sent down any sanction which provides support to their associating others with Allah in His Divinity?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, what authority have do they have to say that the calamities are not averted by God but by the so called saint? Does common sense approve of it? Or, is there any divine Book which says that Allah has delegated His powers to such and such saints, and that they should now be invoked by the people to help them out of difficulties?


## Ayat 36

- `When We make people have a taste of Our Mercy, they exult in it; and when any misfortune befalls them in consequence of their deeds, then lo and behold, they despair.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In the preceding verse the man has been censured for his ignorance, folly and ingratitude.
  - In this verse, he has been censured for puerility and meanness.
  - When a person attains a little wealth and power and respect, and he sees that his business has started flourishing, he forgets that he has been given all this by Allah. 
  - He exults at his success and is so puffed up and conceited that he has neither any regard left for Allah nor for the people.
  - But as soon as good luck deserts him, he loses heart and a single stroke of ill-luck so disheartens and frustrates him that he is prepared to do any mean thing, even commit suicide.


## Ayat 37

- `Do they not see that Allah enlarges and straitens the sustenance of those whom He pleases?`
- `There are Signs in this for those who believe.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the believers can learn how disbelief and shirk affect man’s morality and what is the impact of belief in Allah on his morals. The person who sincerely believes in Allah and looks upon Him as the Master of the treasure houses of provisions, can never be involved in meanness, in which those forgetful ones of God are involved. **If he is given abundantly he will not be puffed up; he will rather be grateful to Allah, will treat his fellowmen generously and benevolently, and will spend his God given wealth for His sake.** On the other hand, he will exercise patience; he will never gamble away his honesty and self respect, but will have hope of Allah’s bounty till the last. Such a moral excellence can neither fall to the lot of an atheist nor of a polytheist.”


## Ayat 38

- `So give his due to`
  - `the near of kin,`
  - `and to the needy,`
  - `and to the wayfarer.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - It has not been said: “Give charity to the relative, the needy and the wayfarer, but their due because this is their right (due to them from you), which you must give them in any case. You should remember it well that if the real owner of the wealth has given you more than others, your extra wealth is, in fact, the right of others, which has been given to you for your trial so that your Lord may see whether you recognize the rights of others and render their rights to them or not.
- `That is better for those who desire to please Allah.`
- `It is they who will prosper.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Anyone who reflects over this divine command and its real spirit will feel that the way proposed by the Quran for man’s moral and spiritual development inevitably envisages the existence of a free society and economy. This development is not possible in a social environment in which the people’s rights of ownership are set aside and stifled. The system in which the state assumes ownership of all resources and the government machinery and the entire responsibility of distributing provisions among the people, so much so that neither can an individual recognize the right of the other and render it, nor a person develop a feeling of goodwill for the other after he has received help, is a purely communist system. **Such an economic and social system, which is being advocated in our country today under the deceptive name of the “Quranic Order of Providence” (Nizami Rububiyat), is entirely opposed to the Quranic scheme itself, for it suppresses the development of individual morality and formation of character altogether.** The Quranic scheme can operate and function only in a society where the individuals own some resources of wealth, possess rights to expend it freely, and then render willingly and sincerely the rights of God and His servants. In such a society alone there can arise the possibility that, on the one hand, the people may develop individually the virtues of sympathy, kindliness and affection, sacrifice, recognition of the rights of others and rendering those rights in the right spirit, and on the other hand, the beneficiaries may develop in their hearts pure feelings of well-wishing, gratitude and thankfulness for the donors. This system only can produce the ideal conditions in which the elimination of evil and the promotion of goodness does not depend on the intervention of a law-enforcing authority but the people’s own purity of the self and their own good intentions take up this responsibility.

## Ayat 39

- `Whatever you pay as interest so that it may increase the wealth of people does not increase in the sight of Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the first verse revealed in the Quran that condemned interest. It only says this: **“You pay interest thinking that it will cause an increase in the wealth of the money-lender. But actually, in the sight of Allah, interest does not increase the wealth, but the wealth is increased by the payment of the Zakat.”** Afterwards, when the commandment prohibiting interest was sent down at Al- Madinah, it was said: **“Allah deprives interest of all blessing and develops charity.”** 
      - For the later commands, see (Surah Aal-Imran: Ayat 130), and (Surah Al-Baqarah: Ayats 275 to 281).
    - This verse has been given two interpretations by the commentators.
      - One section of them says: Here riba does not mean the interest which is forbidden by the Shariah, but it means the gift or the present which is given with the intention that the recipient will return it redoubled, or will perform some useful service for the donor, or his becoming prosperous will be beneficial for the donor himself.
        - “This is the view of Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Dahhak, Qatadah, Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Kaab al-Qurzi and Shabi. Probably this comment has been made by these scholars for the reason that in this verse the only consequence mentioned of the act is that in the sight of Allah such wealth will not increase at all; if, however, it had meant the interest forbidden by the Shariah, it would have been positively said that it will be severely punished by Allah.
        - The other group differs from this and says that it means the same well known riba which has been forbidden by the Shariah. This is the opinion of Hasan Basri and Suddi, and Allama Alusi also has opined that the apparent meaning of the verse is the same, for riba, in Arabic is used in the same meaning. This interpretation has been adopted by the commentator Nisaburi also.
- `As for the Zakah that you give, seeking with it Allah's good pleasure, that is multiplied manifold.`

## Ayat 40

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - From here again the discourse turns to the theme of Tauhid and the Hereafter for the admonition of the disbelievers and the mushriks.

- `It is Allah`
- `Who created you,`
- `then bestowed upon you your sustenance,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “He provided all the various means in the earth for your sustenance and made such arrangements that everyone should receive something from the circulation of the provision.”
- `and He will cause you to die and then will bring you back to life.`
- `Can any of those whom you associate with Allah in His Divinity! do any such thing?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, “If those whom you have set up as deities can neither create, nor provide sustenance, nor have power over life and death, nor can raise you back to life after death, then what for have you set them up as your deities?”
- **`Glory be to Him and exalted be He above whatever they associate with Allah in His Divinity.`**
