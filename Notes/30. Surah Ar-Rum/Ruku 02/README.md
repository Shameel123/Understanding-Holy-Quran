**Ayat 11 - 19**

## Ayat 11

- `Allah creates in the first instance and will later repeat it.`
- `Thereafter it is to Him that you shall be sent back.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Though this thing has been put forward as a claim, it contains the basis of the claim too. Common sense testifies that the One Who can originate creation, can reproduce the same creation far more easily. The origination of the creation is an actuality which exists before everybody, and the disbelievers and the mushriks also admit that this is the work of Allah alone: “Now it will be clearly absurd on their part to think that God Who has originated this creation, cannot reproduce it.”

## Ayat 12

- `On that Day when the Hour will come to pass,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “The Hour”: the Hour of returning to Allah and appearing before Him.
- `the criminals shall be dumbfounded.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word ubliso in the text means to be dumbfounded on account of a sudden shock and despair, to be confounded on finding oneself in a hopeless situation, to stand aghast on finding no means of help and support. When this word is used for a culprit, it depicts a person who is caught red handed, who then finds no way to escape, nor expects to save himself by offering a plea in self defense; therefore, he stands dumb and dejected and depressed.

## Ayat 13

- `None whom they had associated with Allah in His Divinity will intercede on their behalf;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Associates” (shuraka) includes three kinds of beings:
      - (1) The angels, prophets, saints, martyrs and the righteous men, to whom the polytheists assigned divine attributes and powers in different ages and whom they worshiped as gods. On Resurrection Day, they will say to their worshipers, “You did whatever you did without our consent, rather against our teachings and guidance. Therefore, we have nothing to do with you. Do not place any hope in us that we will intercede for you before Allah Almighty.”
- `rather, they will disown those whom they had set up as Allah's associates in His Divinity.`

## Ayat 14

- `On that Day when the Hour will come to pass, people will be split into groups.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, all communities and groups that have been formed in the world on the basis of race, country, language, tribe and clan, and economic and political interests, will break, and the people will be regrouped on the basis of true belief, morality and character.
    - On the one hand, all the believing and righteous people will be separated from all the nations of mankind and put in one group. And on the other hand, people professing every false ideology and committing every kind of crime in the world will be sorted out from the multitudes of mankind and put into separate groups.
  - In other words, the thing which Islam regards as the real basis of separation and union in the world and which the worshipers of ignorance refuse to accept, will become the basis of separation and union in the Hereafter. Islam says that the real thing which joins men together or divides them is the belief and morality. Those who believe and build the system of life on divine guidance are one community, whether they belong to any race, any country and any region. The two cannot belong to one nation. They can neither walk together on a common path of life in the world, nor can meet with the same end in the Hereafter. From the world to the Hereafter they tread separate paths and have separate destinations. Contrary to this, the worshipers of falsehood have been insisting in every age, and still insist, that mankind should be classified and grouped on the bases of race and country and language. The people who have a common race and country and language should constitute a separate nation, regardless of their religion and belief, and should offer a common front against the other similar nations. And this nation should have such a system of life which should bind the followers of Tauhid and the polytheists and the atheists together. The same was the concept of Abu Jahl and Abu Lahab and the chiefs of the Quraish. That is why they accused the Prophet Muhammad (peace he upon him) again and again of having stirred up divisions in their nation.
  - That is why the Quran is warning that the groups made in the world on wrong basis will ultimately break and mankind will be permanently divided on the basis of the belief and the philosophy of life and morality and character on which Islam wants to build it in the world. The people who do not have a common destination cannot follow a common way of life.

## Ayat 15

- `Then those who believed and acted righteously will be placed in a Garden`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “A Garden”: A garden of bliss and perfect happiness as a reward and source of everlasting joy.
- `and will be happy and jubilant.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The word yuhbarun in the original implies this: “They will be lodged in it with honor, will remain happy and be provided with every kind of pleasure.”

## Ayat 16

- `As for those who disbelieved and gave the lie to Our Signs and to the encounter of the Hereafter, they will be arraigned for chastisement.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - One thing here is noteworthy. Good works have been mentioned as a necessary adjunct of the faith, which will earn one the blissful Garden. But no mention has been made of the evil acts while mentioning the evil end of disbelief. This clearly indicates that disbelief by itself is enough to mar the destiny of a person, whether it is accompanied by the evil act or not.


## Ayat 17

- `So`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “So”, here, implies, when you have come to know the good results of belief and righteous acts and the evil consequences of disbelief and denial of the truth, you should adopt the following conduct. It also means: By holding the life Hereafter to be impossible, the polytheists and disbelievers are, in fact, holding Allah to be helpless. Therefore, as against them, you should glorify Allah, and proclaim that He is free from this weakness. This command has been addressed to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and through him to all the believers.
- `glorify Allah in the evening and the morning.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “To glorify Allah” means to proclaim Allah’s being free from and exalted above the defects and faults and weaknesses, which the mushriks ascribe to Him due to their shirk and denial of the Hereafter.
    - **The best form of this proclamation and expression is the Prayer.**
    - That is why Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, lbn Zaid and other commentators say that here “to glorify” means to offer the prescribed Prayer. A clear indication in favor of this commentary is contained in the verse itself. It lays down certain definite times for the glorification of Allah. Evidently, if it was meant to instill the belief that Allah is free from all defects and weaknesses, there should be no question of the restriction of the times of the morning and evening, and the early and late afternoon, for a Muslim should always have this belief. Similarly, if it was meant to teach glorifying Allah merely verbally, it should be meaningless to specify the times, for a Muslim should express Allah’s glory at all times. Therefore, inevitably the command to glorify Allah with the restriction of the times points to its particular practical form which is none other than the Prayer.

## Ayat 18

- `His is all praise in the heavens and in the earth; (and glorify Him) in the afternoon and when the sun begins to decline.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse clearly points to the times of the Fajr (morning), Maghrib (evening), Asr (late afternoon) and the Zuhr (early afternoon) Prayers.

## Ayat 19

- `He brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living, and revives the earth after it is dead.`
-  `Likewise will you be raised to life (after you die).`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, how can that God Who is doing all this perpetually in front of your eyes, be helpless in raising man to life after death? He is causing absolutely dead matter to be discharged from living man and animals. He is ever bringing into existence countless animals and human beings by breathing life into dead matter, whereas the substances themselves which make up the bodies of the living beings are absolutely without life. He is making you witness the phenomenon that wherever water becomes available, lands previously lying barren start blooming and blossoming with animal and vegetable life. In spite of witnessing all this if a person thinks that the God Who is sustaining the universe will be helpless to raise man back to life after death, he is fully devoid of the common sense. His heart does not see the clear realities gleaming from the manifestations which his eyes see.
