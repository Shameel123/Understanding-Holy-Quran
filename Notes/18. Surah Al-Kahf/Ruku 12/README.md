**Ayat  102 - 110**

## Ayat 102

  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the conclusion of the whole Surah and is not connected with the story of Zul-Qarnain only but with the subject matter of this Surah as a whole.
    - That theme was enunciated at the beginning of the (Surah Ayats 1-8): The Prophet (peace be upon him) invited his people.
      1. To give up shirk and adopt the doctrine of Tauhid instead.
      2. To give up the worship of the world and to believe in the life of the Hereafter. But the chiefs of his people, who were puffed up with their wealth and grandeur, not only rejected his invitation but also persecuted and insulted those righteous people who had accepted his invitation.
     -  The discourse deals with the same themes and utilizes in an excellent manner the three stories which were related in answer to the questions put by the opponents of Islam as a test of his Prophethood.

- `Do the unbelievers, then, believe that they can take any of My creatures as their guardians beside Me?`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, do they still stick to their presumption even after hearing all this and believe that their attitude will be profitable for them?
- `Verily We have prepared Hell to welcome the unbelievers.`

## Ayat 103

- `Say, (O Muhammad):`
  - `"Shall We tell you who will be the greatest losers in respect of their works?`

## Ayat 104

- `It will be those whose effort went astray in the life of the world and who believe nevertheless that they are doing good.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse has two meanings.
  - The one is the same that we have adopted in the translation.
  - The other meaning is this: Those who confined all their endeavors to the worldly life. That is, whatever they did, they did for this world without paying any regard to God and the Hereafter.
  - As they considered the worldly life to be the real life, they made the success and prosperity in this world their sole aim and object. Even if they professed the existence of Allah, they never paid any heed to the two implications of this profession: to lead their lives in a way to please Allah and to come out successful on the Day they shall have to render an account of what they did in this world.
  - This was because they considered themselves to be mere rational animals who were absolutely independent and free from every kind of responsibility and had nothing else to do but to enjoy the good things of the world like animals in a meadow.

## Ayat 105

- `Those are the ones who refused to believe in the revelations of their Lord and that they are bound to meet Him.`
- `Hence, all their deeds have come to naught, and We shall assign no weight to them on the Day of Resurrection.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - **“So worthless will be their deeds”** in the sense that they will be of no avail to them in the life after death, even though they might have considered them as their great achievements but the fact is that they will lose all their value as soon as the world shall come to an end.
  - When they will go before their Lord, and all their deeds shall be placed in the scales, they will have no weight at all whether they had built great palaces, established great universities and libraries, set up great factories and laboratories, constructed highways and railways, in short, all their inventions, industries, sciences and arts and other things of which they were very proud in this world, will lose their weights in the scales.
  - **The only thing which will have weight there will be that which had been done in accordance with the divine instructions and with the intention to please Allah.**
  - It is, therefore, obvious that if all of one’s endeavors were confined to the worldly things and the achievement of worldly desires whose results one would see in this world, one should not reasonably expect to see their results in the Hereafter, for they would have gone waste with the end of this world.
  - It is equally obvious, that only the deeds of the one, who performed them strictly in accordance with His instructions to win His approval with a view to avail of their results in the Hereafter, will find that his deeds had weight in the scales. On the contrary, such a one will find that all his endeavors in the world had gone waste.

## Ayat 106

- `Hell is their recompense for disbelieving and their taking My revelations and My Messengers as objects of jest.`

## Ayat 107

- `As for those who believe and do good works,`
- `the Gardens of Paradise shall be there to welcome them;`

## Ayat 108

- `there they will abide for ever, with no desire to be removed from there."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - **“No desire will they have to be removed there from”**
  - because they will find no place and no condition better than those in Paradise.

## Ayat 109

- `Say:`
  - `"If the sea were to become ink to record the Words of my Lord, indeed the sea would be all used up before the Words of my Lord are exhausted, and it would be the same even if We were to bring an equal amount of ink."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - By “words” are meant the marvelous works, the excellences and the wonders of His Power and Wisdom.

## Ayat 110

- `Say (O Muhammad):`
  - `"I am no more than a human being like you;`
  - `one to whom revelation is made:`
  - **`'Your Lord is the One and Only God.'`**
  - `Hence, whoever looks forward to meet his Lord, let him do righteous works, and let him associate none with the worship of his Lord."`
