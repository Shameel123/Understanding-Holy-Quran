**Ayat  60 - 70**

## Ayat 60

- `(And recount to them the story of Moses)`
- `when Moses said to his servant:`
  - `"I will journey on until I reach the point where the two rivers meet, though I may march on for ages."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Though this story was told in answer to the question of the disbelievers, it has been used to impress a very important truth on the minds of both the disbelievers and the believers.
  - It is this:
    - those people who draw their conclusions only from the seeming aspects of events, make a very serious error in their deductions, for they only see what is apparent and do not go deep into the divine wisdom that underlies them.
    - When they daily see the prosperity of the tyrants and the afflictions of the innocent people, the affluence of the disobedient people and the indigence of the obedient people, the enjoyments of the wicked people and the adversity of the virtuous people, they get involved in mental conflicts, nay, they become victims of misunderstandings because they do not comprehend the wisdom behind them. The disbelievers and the tyrants conclude from this that the world is functioning without any moral laws and has no sovereign, and, if there is one, he must be senseless and unjust: therefore one may do whatever he desires for there is none to whom one shall be accountable. On the other hand, when the believers see those things, they become so frustrated and disheartened that sometimes their faiths are put to a very hard trial.
  - It was to unravel the wisdom behind this mystery that Allah slightly lifted the curtain from the reality governing His factory, so that Moses (peace be upon him) might see the wisdom behind the events that are happening day and night and how their seeming aspect is quite different from the reality.

## Ayat 61

- `But when they reached the point where the two rivers meet,`
- `they forgot their fish,`
- `and it took its way into the sea, as if through a tunnel.`

## Ayat 62

- `When they had journeyed further on,`
- `Moses said to his servant:`
  - `"Bring us our repast. We are surely fatigued by today's journey."`

## Ayat 63

- `The servant said:`
  - `"Did you see what happened?`
  - `When we betook ourselves to the rock to take rest,`
  - `I forgot the fish �`
  - `and it is only Satan who caused me to forget to mention it to you �`
  - `so that it made its way into the sea in a strange manner."`

## Ayat 64


- `Moses said:`
  - `"That is what we were looking for."`
- `So the two turned back, retracing their footsteps,`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, the same was the sign of the place of our destination.
  - This shows that Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) had taken this journey at Allah’s behest to meet His servant.
  - He had been told that he would meet the servant at the place where the fish would disappear.

## Ayat 65

- `and there they found one of Our servants upon whom We had bestowed Our mercy,`
- `and to whom We had imparted a special knowledge from Ourselves.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The name of this servant has been stated to be Khidr in all the authentic books of traditions.
  - Thus there is no reason why it should be considered at all that his name was Elijah, as some people have asserted under the influence of the Israelite traditions.
  - Their assertion is incorrect not only because it contradicts the assertion of the Prophet (peace be upon him) but it is also absurd because Prophet Elijah (peace be upon him) was born several hundred years after Prophet Moses (peace be upon him).
  - Though the Quran does not mention the name of the attendant of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him), according to some traditions he was Joshua, the son of Nun, who succeeded him.


## Ayat 66

- `Moses said to him:`
  - `"May l follow you that you may teach me something of the wisdom which you have been taught?"`

## Ayat 67

- `He answered:`
  - `"You will surely not be able to bear with me.`

## Ayat 68

- `For how can you patiently bear with something you cannot encompass in your knowledge?"`

## Ayat 69

- `Moses replied:`
  - `"You shall find me, if Allah wills, patient; and I shall not disobey you in anything."`

## Ayat 70

- `He said:`
  - `"Well, if you follow me, do not ask me concerning anything until I myself mention it to you."`
