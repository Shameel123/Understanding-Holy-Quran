**Ayat  54 - 59**

## Ayat 54

- `And surely We have explained matters to people in the Qur'an in diverse ways,`
- `using all manner of parables.`
- `But man is exceedingly contentious.`

## Ayat 55

- `What is it that prevented mankind from believing when the guidance came to them, and from asking forgiveness of their Lord,`
- `except that they would like to be treated as the nations of yore,`
- `or that they would like to see the scourge come upon them face to face?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is to warn the people that the Quran has left no stone unturned in making the truth plain. It has employed all kinds of arguments, parables, similitude and used all the possible effective ways to appeal to the heart and the mind of man, and adopted the best possible style. If, in spite of this, they do not accept the truth, it is obvious that they are waiting for Godâ€™s scourge like the one that visited the former communities to make them realize their error.

## Ayat 56

- `We raise Messengers only to give good news and to warn.`
- `But the unbelievers resort to falsehood in order to rebut the truth with it,`
- `and scoff at My revelations and My warnings.`

## Ayat 57

- `Who is more wicked than the man who, when he is reminded by the revelations of his Lord, turns away from them and forgets (the consequence of) the deeds wrought by his own hands?`
- `We have laid veils over their hearts lest they understand the message of the Qur'an, and We have caused heaviness in their ears.`
- `Call them as you may to the Right Path, they will not be ever guided aright.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Allah puts a covering over the heart of a person and makes his ears hard of hearing the truth when he adopts the attitude of contention, dispute, wrangling and argumentation towards the admonition of a well wisher and tries to defeat the truth with the weapons of falsehood and cunning.
  - Naturally this attitude produces in him obduracy and obstinacy so that he turns a deaf ear towards guidance, and is unwilling to realize his error before seeing his evil end.
  - For such people pay no heed to admonition and warning and insist on falling into the abyss of perdition: then and then alone they are convinced that it was perdition towards which they were rushing headlong.

## Ayat 58

- `Your Lord is All-Forgiving, full of mercy.`
- `Had He wished to take them to task for their doings, He would have hastened in sending His scourge upon them.`
- `But He has set for them a time-limit which they cannot evade.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is to warn the foolish people that they should not be deluded by the respite that is given to them and presume that they will never be taken to task whatever they may go on doing.
  - They forget that Allah gives them respite because He is Forgiving and Forbearing and does not punish the evil doers on the spot, for His Mercy demands that the evil doers should be given respite so that they may mend their ways.

## Ayat 59

- `All the townships afflicted with scourge are before your eyes.`
- `When they committed wrong, We destroyed them.`
- `For the destruction of each We had set a definite term.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The ruined habitations were of Saba, Thamud, Midian and the people of Prophet Lot, which were visited by the Quraish during their trade journeys, and which were quite well known to other Arabs also.
