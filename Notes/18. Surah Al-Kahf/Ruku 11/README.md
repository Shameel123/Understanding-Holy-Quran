**Ayat  83 - 101**

## Ayat 83

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It is quite obvious that the conjunction wao joins this story with the previous story of Khidr.
  - Thus it is a selfevident proof that the previous two stories of the sleepers of the cave and Moses and Khidr were also related in answer to the queries of the disbelievers of Makkah who, in consultation with the people of the Book, had put these questions to Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a test of his Prophethood.


- `(O Muhammad), they ask you about Dhu al-Qarnayn.`
- `Say:`
  - `"I will give you an account of him."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The identification of Zul-Qarnain has been a controversial matter from the earliest times.
  - In general the commentators have been of the opinion that he was Alexander the Great but the characteristics of Zul-Qarnain described in the Quran are not applicable to him.
  - However, now the commentators are inclined to believe that Zul- Qarnain was Cyrus, an ancient king of Iran.
  - We are also of the opinion that probably Zul-Qarnain was Cyrus, but the historical facts, which have come to light up to this time, are not sufficient to make any categorical assertion.

## Ayat 84

- `We granted him power in the land and endowed him with all kinds of resources.`

## Ayat 85

- `He set out (westwards) on an expedition,`

## Ayat 86

- `until when he reached the very limits where the sun sets,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “The setting place of the sun” does not mean the place of the setting of the sun.
    - According to Ibn Kathir, it means that he marched to the west conquering one country after the other till he reached the last boundary of the land, beyond which there was ocean.
- `he saw it setting in dark turbid waters;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “He found it setting in a muddy spring”:
    - If Zul Qarnain was Cyrus, then that place would be the western limit of Asia Minor and the black waters would be the Aegean Sea. 
    - This interpretation is supported by the use of the word ain instead of bahr in the Quran.
- `and nearby he met a people.`
- `We said:`
  - `"O Dhu al-Qarnayn, you have the power to punish or to treat them with kindness."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - “We said” does not necessarily mean that Allah directly revealed to him these words, and that Zul-Qarnain was a Prophet or was the one who received inspiration from Allah, and the same is the reasonable conjecture.
      - This concerns the time when Zul-Qarnain had taken possession of the land as a conqueror and the conquered people were utterly at your mercy.
      - Then Allah posed a question before his conscience, as if to say: Now is the time of your trial.
      - These people are utterly at your mercy, and you have the option either to behave unjustly towards them or to treat them generously.

## Ayat 87

- `He said:`
  - `"We will chastise him who does wrong,`
  - `whereafter he will be returned to his Lord and He will chastise him grievously.`

## Ayat 88

- `But as for him who believes and acts righteously,`
- `his will be a goodly reward and`
- `we shall enjoin upon him only mild commands."`

## Ayat 89

- `Then he set out on another expedition`

## Ayat 90

- `until he reached the limit where the sun rises`
- `and he found it rising on a people whom We had provided no shelter from it.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, when he advanced towards the east, conquering one country after the other, he reached a territory where the limits of the civilized world had come to an end and beyond which was the territory of barbaric people, who had no shelter at all of tents or buildings.”

## Ayat 91

- `Thus was the state of those people, and We encompassed in knowledge all concerning Dhu al- Qarnayn.`

## Ayat 92

- `Then he set out on another expedition`

## Ayat 93

- `until when he reached a place between the two mountains,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The “two mountains” must have been parts of that mountain range which runs between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea as stated in (Ayat 96). This must be so because beyond them was the territory of Gog and Magog.
- `he found beside the mountains a people who scarcely understood anything.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, it was difficult to communicate with them: their language was almost foreign to Zul-Qarnain and his companions, and, as they were quite barbaric, none could understand their language, nor were they acquainted with any foreign language.

## Ayat 94

- `They said:`
  - `"O Dhu al-Qarnayn,`
  - `Gog and Magog1 are spreading corruption in this land.`
  - `So shall we pay you taxes on the understanding that you will set up a barrier between us and them?"`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - As has already been pointed out in (E.N. 62), Gog and Magog were the wild tribes of North Eastern Asia which, from the very early times had been making inroads on settled kingdoms and empires in Asia and Europe and ravaging them.
  - According to Genesis (Chapter 10), they were the descendants of Japheth, the son of Noah, and the Muslim historians have also accepted this.
  - And according to the book of Ezekiel (Chapters 38, 39), they inhabited the territories of Meshech (Moscow) and Tubal (Tubalsek). 
  - According to the Israelite historian Josephus, they were the Scythians and their territory spread to the north and the east of the Black Sea.
  - According to Jerome, Magog inhabited the territory to the north of Caucasia near the Caspian Sea.

## Ayat 95

- `He answered:`
  - `"Whatever my Lord has granted me is good enough.`
  - `But help me with your labour and I will erect a rampart between you and them.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, as a ruler it is my duty to protect you from the ravages of your enemies: therefore it is not lawful for me to levy any extra taxes on you for this purpose.
  - The treasury that Allah has placed in my custody suffices for this purpose. You shall, however, have to help me with your manual labor.

## Ayat 96

- `Bring me ingots of iron."`
- `Then after he had filled up the space between the two mountain-sides, he said:`
  - `"(Light a fire) and ply bellows."`
- `When he had made it (red like) fire, he said:`
  - `"Bring me molten copper which I may pour on it."`

## Ayat 97

- `Such was the rampart`
- `that Gog and Magog could not scale,`
- `nor could they pierce it.`

## Ayat 98

- `Dhu al-Qarnayn said:`
  - `"This is a mercy from my Lord:`
  - `but when the time of my Lord's promise shall come,`
  - `He will level the rampart with the ground.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, though I have built a very strong iron wall, as far as it was possible for me, it is not ever lasting, for it will last only as long as Allah wills, and will fall down to pieces when the time of my Lord’s promise shall come. Then no power in the world shall be able to keep it safe and secure.
  - `My Lord's promise always comes true."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - As regards to the time of Allah’s promise, it has two meanings. 
        1. It may mean the time of the destruction of the wall.
        2. It may also mean the time of the death and destruction of everything destined by Allah at the end of the world i.e. the Hour of Resurrection.

## Ayat 99

- `And on that Day`
- `We shall let some of them surge like waves against others,`
- `and the Trumpet shall be blown.`
- `Then We shall gather them all together.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “That Day”: “The Day of Resurrection”.
  - As if to continue the theme of life after death to which Zul-Qarnain referred as the time of my Lord’s promise, the Quran has added (verses 99-101) to it.

## Ayat 100

- `That will be the Day We shall place Hell before the unbelievers`

## Ayat 101

- `whose eyes had become blind against My admonition and who were utterly disinclined to hear it.`
