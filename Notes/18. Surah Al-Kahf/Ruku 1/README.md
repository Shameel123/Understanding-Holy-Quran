**Ayat  1 - 12**
# Ruku 1

Ayat 1:
- `Praise be to Allah`
- `Who has revealed to His servant`
- `the Book devoid of all crookedness;`
- The Ayah starts by praising Allah SWT, to Whom all praise belongs. He has revealed His Book on slave عَلَىٰ عَبْدِهِ and the Book does not have any crookedness.

Ayat 2:
- `An unerringly Straight Book,`
- `Meant to warn of a stern punishment from Allah,` لِّيُنذِرَ بَأْسًۭا شَدِيدًۭا  
- `And to proclaim, to those who believe and work righteous deeds, the tiding that theirs shall be a good reward`
- The Ayah gives continues from the previous Ayah to explain about the properties of Holy Quran.
- Furthremore, it explains Horrible (Shadeedan) Punishment as a 'warning'.
  - In this Ayah, it is not mentioned that the punishment would be given. It is mentioned as a 'warning'.
- It further proclaims glad tidings to the ones who Believe in the revealed Holy Book i.e., Holy Quran which 100% straight and 0% crooked.


Ayat 3:
- `wherein they shall abide for ever;`
- The Ayat continue from the previous Ayah just like the previous Ayah was continued from the one previous to that.
- It mentions that such people who believe, will remain in Jannah forever <3.


Ayat 4:
- `and also to warn those who say: `
- `"Allah has taken to Himself a son,"`
- This is also a 'warning' however it is directed towards Chirstians (Nasara).
  - But it could be directed towards anyone who claims this Forbidden and Unsaid thing.

Ayat 5:
- `A thing about which they have no knowledge, `
- `neither they nor their ancestors. `
  - Neither the current christians, nor their forefathers had such a knowledge to claim such a dreadful thing.
  - This could be directed to us in such a way about how some of us in this Ummah in one way or another that I would like to avoid writing here (for now).
    - This topic itself require *extensive* amount of research.
- `Dreadful is the word that comes out of their mouths. What they utter is merely a lie.`


Ayat 6:
- `(O Muhammad), if they do not believe in this Message,1 you will perhaps torment yourself to death with grief, sorrowing over them.`
 - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
   - This refers to the real cause of the anxiety of the Prophet (peace be upon him) at the time of the revelation of this Surah. 
   - It clearly shows that the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not grieve at the persecution from which he and his companions were suffering 
   - but at the deviation and moral degeneration of his people. 
   - What was consuming him was that, though he was trying to bring them out from their disgraceful state, they persisted in it. 
   - He was grieved because he was convinced that their deviation would inevitably lead them to destruction and scourge of Allah. 
   - Therefore he was working day and night to save them but it appeared that they were bent upon incurring the chastisement of Allah. 
   - The Prophet (peace be upon him) himself has described this state of his mind in a tradition to this effect: 
   - `I may describe this thing in a parable. A person kindled a fire to spread light but the moths persist in falling over it to burn themselves alive. He tries to save them from the fire but the moths reduce his efforts to failure. The same is true of me and you. I hold you by your skirts to keep you away from the fire, but you are bent upon falling into it. (Bukhari, Muslim).`


Ayat 7:
- `Surely We have made all that is on the earth an embellishment for it in order` **`to test people`** `as to who of them is better in conduct.` 
  - We are going through an exam... The question includes 'embellishment'...


Ayat 8:
- `In the ultimate, We shall reduce all that is on the earth to a barren plain.`
- Everything that has been created to test us will return to 'dust'.
  - This could lead to a really good research topic...


- Ayat 9:
  - **`Do you think that`** 
  - 1. `the people of the Cave`
    - Kahf
  - 2. `and the Inscription` 
    - Arraqim
  - `were one of` **`Our wondrous signs?`**
  - This Ayah within itself is going to require extensive amount of thinking, research and studies.
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - There is a difference of opinion about the meaning of arraqim. 
    - Some companions and their followers opined that it was the name of that habitation where this event took place and that it was situated somewhere between Aylah and Palestine. 
    - There are other commentators who take it to mean the inscription that had been set up at the cave as a memorial to the sleepers of the cave. 
    - Abul Kalam Azad, in his commentary, Tarjmanul-Quran, has preferred the first meaning and opined that it is the same place which has been called Rekem in the Bible (Joshua, 18: 27). 
      - Then he identifies it with the ancient historical city of Petra.
      -  But he has not considered the fact that Rekem, as mentioned in the Bible, belonged to the children of Benjamin and according to the Book of Joshua, the territory of this clan was situated to the west of river Jordan and the Dead Sea and that the ruins of Petra are situated to the south of Jordan. 
     - That is why the modern archaeologists do not believe that Petra and Rekem are one and the same place. 
     - (Please refer to Encyclopedia Britannica, 1946, Vol XVII, page 658). We are also of the opinion that by Arraqim is meant the inscription.
  - Maarif-ul-Quran:
    - Kahf is a large mountainous cave or cavern. 
    - If not large, it will be a ghar. 
    - The word: الرَّ‌قِيمِ (al-Raqim) literally denotes: اَلمَرقُوم (al-marqum) that is, something written. 
    - What does it mean at this place? 
    - The sayings of commentators differ about it. 
    - Dahhak, Sudiyy and Ibn Jubayr following the authority of Sayyidna ' Abdullah ibn ' Abbas ؓ declare it to mean a written tablet on which the ruler of the time had inscribed the names of the People of Kahf and had it fixed on the entrance to the Cave. 
    - For this reason, the People of Kahf are also called the People of al-Raqim (the inscribed ones). 
    - Qatadah, ' Atiyyah, ' Awfi and Mujhid have said that Raqim is the name of the valley adjoining the mountain in which the hollow cavern of the People of Kahf was located. 
    - Some others have identified this mountain itself as the Raqim. ' Ikrimah says, "I have heard Sayyidna ibn ' Abbas رضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہما saying - I do not know whether Raqim is the name of some inscribed tablet or some town." 
    - Ka'b al-Alahbar and Wahb ibn Munabbih report from Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ that Raqim is the name of a town near Ailah, that is, 'Aqabah, situated in the kingdom of the Romans.


Ayat 10:
- `When those youths sought refuge in the Cave and said:` 
- `"Our Lord! Grant us mercy from Yourself and provide for us rectitude in our affairs."`
- Maarif-ul-Quran:
  - Fityah (فِتْيَةُ ) in verse 10 is the plural of: فَتٰی : fata, which means a young man.


Ayat 11:
 - `We lulled them to sleep in that cave for a number of years`
   - Number of years are not important
 - Maarif-ul-Quran:
   - The expression: فَضَرَ‌بْنَا عَلَىٰ آذَانِهِمْ (translated as 'so, We veiled their hearing [ putting them to sleep ] ' - 11) literally means to plug ears to prevent someone from hearing. 
  - It is used to convey the sense of deep sleep. 
  - When sleeping, eyes close first but ears remain active. Sounds are heard. 
  - When sleep takes over completely, ears stop functioning. Later, when awake, ears resume their function first for sound startles the person sleeping who then comes out of his sleep.
  - Note: I had never ever observed the state of sleep like this.
    - In a lecture of 'Nauman Ali Khan', I heard him saying that in Holy Quran, 'hearing' is always mentioned first before 'seeing' and I think, this could indirectly be one of those places.
    - The Holy Quran is 'listened', the miracles are not 'seen'. Until, listening is opened and seeing miracles are hidden from naked eye, the doors for Taubah are open. As soon as we start seeing the angels of Death and all of those things we 'listened', we would not be able to go back.



Ayat 12:
- `and then roused them so that We might see `
- `which of the two parties could best tell the length of their stay.`

The Ruku completes by introducing the People of Cave in a wonderful manner, just like a an inspiring trailer to a most wonderful story.
