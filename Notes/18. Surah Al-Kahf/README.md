### Properties of Surah Al-Kahf 
#### Tahfim-ul-Quran

##### Memorization:
- According to a narration of Sayyidna Abu al-Darda' ؓ appearing in Muslim, Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi, al-Nasa'i and the Musnad of Ahmad, 
  - one who has memorized the first ten verses of Surah al-Kahf will remain protected from the ill effects of Dajjal (imposter). 
- In another report in the same books and from the same authority, 
  - the same thing has been said about having memorized the last ten verses of Surah al-Kahf.


##### Merit 1
- And it has been reported in the Musnad of Ahmad on the authority of Sayyidna Sahl ibn Mu` adh ؓ that 
- The Holy Prophet ﷺ said, 
  - `One who recites the first and the last verses of Surah al-Kahf, for him there is light from his feet up to his head. And the one who were to recite the whole Surah, then, for him there is light from the earth up to the sky.`

##### Merit 2
It appears in some narratives that:
 - A person who recites Surah al-Kahf on the day of Jumu'ah will have light from his feet up to the sky. 
 - This light will serve him well on the day of Qiyamah, and every sin committed by him between the past and the present Jumu'ah will be forgiven." 
 - (Imam Ibn Kathir has declared this report to be mawquf (a Hadith the narration of which stops at a Sahabi and does not ascend to the Holy Prophet ﷺ).

##### Merit 3
And Hafiz Zya' al-Maqdisi, in his book Al-Mukhtarah, has reported on the authority of Sayyidna ` Ali ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, 
- `One who recites Surah al-Kahf on the day of Jumu'ah will remain protected from every fitnah. And if Dajjal appears, he will stay safe against the trying challenges released by him as well.` 
- (All these narrative reports have been taken from Tafsir ibn Kathir)

##### Merit 4


According to a report from Dailami on the authority of Sayyidna Anas ؓ appearing in Ruh al-Ma’ ani, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, 
`The entire Surah al-Kahf was revealed at one time and seventy thousand angels came with it` - which shows its majesty.



##### Cause of Revelation

- Imam ibn Jarir al-Tabari has reported from Sayyidna ' Abdullah ibn ' Abbas ؓ عنہما that 
- The Quraysh of Makkah (disturbed by the rising influence of the Holy Prophet ﷺ as a prophet) sent two of their men, Nadr ibn Harith and 'Uqbah ibn Abi Mu` ayt, to the Jewish scholars of Madinah. 
- Their mission was to find out what they said about him as they were learned in past scriptures of the Torah and Injil.
-  The Jewish scholars told them, 
-  `put three questions before him. If he answers these correctly, you should know that he is a Prophet and Messenger of Allah ﷺ ، and if he fails to do that, you should know that he is a pretender and not a messenger.`
-  `Firstly, ask him about the young men who had left their city in the distant past and what had happened to them, for this is a unique event.` 
-  `Secondly, ask him about the person who had traveled through the East and West of the Earth and what had happened to him.` 
-  `Thirdly, ask him about the Ruh (soul, spirit) as to what it was?"`
-  The two Quraysh emissaries returned to Makkah al-Mukarramah, informed their tribesmen that they had come back with a decisive plan of action and told them all about their encounter with the Jewish scholars of Madinah. 
-  Then, these people took these questions to the Holy Prophet ﷺ . 
-  He heard the questions and said that he will answer them tomorrow. `But, he forgot to say 'insha Allah' at that time.`
-   These people went back and the Holy Prophet ﷺ kept waiting for the Divine revelation in the hope that he will be told about answers to these questions through wahy. 
-   But, no wahy came until the next day as promised. 
-   In fact, fifteen days went by and things stood as they were, neither did Sayyidna Jibra'il come nor did the revelation. 
-   The Quraysh of Makkah started throwing taunts which caused real pain to the Holy Prophet ﷺ . 
-   After fifteen days, came angel Jibra'il with Surah al-Kahf (wherein the delay caused has also been explained by saying `that one should say 'insha Allah' when promising to do something in the future.` 
-   Since, this was not done in the event concerned, therefore, revelation was delayed as a measure of reminder. 
-   In this Surah, verses relating to this matter such as: وَلَا تَقُولَنَّ لِشَيْءٍ إِنِّي فَاعِلٌ ذَٰلِكَ غَدًا إِلَّا أَن يَشَاءَ اللَّـهُ (18:23, 24) will be appearing later). 
-   Also related in this Surah there was the event about the young men known as Ashab al-Kahf or the People of the Cave, 
-   And the event concerning the travel of Dhul-Qarnain from the East to the West. 
-   Also included therein was the answer to the question asked about 'Ruh' (Qurtubi and Mazhari with reference to Ibn Jarir). 
-   But, answering the question about Ruh (soul, spirit) briefly was as dictated by wisdom. 
-   This was taken up separately at the end of Surah Bani Isra'il (17:85) 
-   And this is the reason why Surah al-Kahf has been placed after Surah Bani Isra'il [ al-Isra'] - as mentioned by Al-Suyuti.
