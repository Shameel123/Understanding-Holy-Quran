**Ayat  32 - 44**

## Ayat 32

- `(O Muhammad), propound a parable to them.`
- `There were two men of whom We bestowed upon one of the two vineyards, surrounding both of them with date-palms and putting a tillage in between.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In order to understand the significance of this parable we should keep in view( Ayat 28 )in which arrogant chiefs of Makkah were told that the poor companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) would not be discarded to please them.

## Ayat 33

- `Both the vineyards yielded abundant produce without failure and We caused a stream to flow in their midst`

## Ayat 34

- `so the owner had fruit in abundance and he said to his neighbour, while conversing with him:`
  - `"I have greater wealth than you and I am stronger than you in numbers."`

## Ayat 35

- `Then he entered his vine-yard1 and said, wronging himself:`
  - `"Surely, I do not believe that all this will ever perish.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - He considered his gardens to be Paradise. Thus he behaved like those mean persons who, when rise to power and wealth, are always involved in the misunderstanding that they are enjoying Paradise in this world, therefore they do not stand in need of any other Paradise.

## Ayat 36

- `Nor do I believe that the Hour of Resurrection will ever come to pass.`
- `And even if I am returned to my Lord, I shall find a better place than this."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, I donâ€™t think there is any life after death, but supposing there be one, I shall fare even better there than in my present life, for my prosperity is a clear proof that I am a favorite of God.

## Ayat 37

- `While conversing with him his neighbour exclaimed:`
  - `"Do you deny Him Who created you out of dust,`
  - `then out of a drop of sperm,`
  - `and then fashioned you into a complete man?`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This shows that unbelief in Allah is not confined to the denial of the existence of God in so many words, but arrogance, pride, vanity and the denial of the Hereafter are also kufr. Although that person did not deny the existence of Allah, he professed it as is apparent from his words (And if I am brought back to my Lord), yet in spite of his profession, his neighbor charged him with unbelief in Allah. This is because the person, who considers his wealth and his grandeur etc. to be the fruits of his own power and capability and not the favors of Allah, and who thinks that they are everlasting and none can take than away from him and that he is not accountable to anyone, is guilty of unbelief in Allah, even though he might profess belief in Him, for he acknowledges Allah as a Being and not as his Master, Owner and Sovereign. In fact, belief in Allah demands not merely the profession of His existence but also the acknowledgment of His Sovereignty, Mastery, Rule and the like. 

## Ayat 38

- `As for myself,`
- `Allah alone is my Lord,`
- `and I associate none with my Lord in His Divinity.`

## Ayat 39

- `When you entered your vineyard, why did you not say:`
  - `'Whatever Allah wills shall come to pass, for there is no power1 save with Allah!'`
- `If you find me less than yourself in wealth and children`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, If we are able to do anything, it is by the help and support of Allah alone.

## Ayat 40

- `it may well be that my Lord will give me something better than your vineyard, and send a calamity upon your vineyard from the heavens and it will be reduced to a barren waste,`

## Ayat 41

- `or the water of your vineyard will be drained deep into the ground so that you will not be able to seek it out."`

## Ayat 42

- `Eventually all his produce was destroyed and he began to wring his hands in sorrow at the loss of what he had spent on it, and on seeing it fallen down upon its trellises, saying:`
  - `"Would I had not associated anyone with my Lord in His Divinity."`

## Ayat 43

- `And there was no host, beside Allah, to help him, nor could he be of any help to himself.`

## Ayat 44

- `(Then he knew) that all power of protection rests with Allah, the True One.`
- `He is the best to reward, the best to determine the end of things.`
