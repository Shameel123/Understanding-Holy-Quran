**Ayat  50 - 53**

## Ayat 50

- `And recall when We said to the angels:`
  - `"Prostrate yourselves before Adam";`
- `all of them fell prostrate, except Iblis.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The reference to the story of Adam and Iblis has been made here to warn the erring people of their folly.
    - It is an obvious folly that people should discard their Prophets, who were their well wishers, and get entangled in the snare set by their eternal enemy, Iblis, who has been jealous of man ever since he refused to bow down before Adam and became accursed.
- `He was of the jinn and so disobeyed the command of his Lord.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It was possible for Iblis to disobey Allah because he was not one of the angels but one of the jinns. It must be noted that the Quran is very explicit that the angels are inherently obedient.
- `Will you, then, take him and his progeny as your guardians rather than Me although they are your open enemies?`
- `What an evil substitute are these wrong-doers taking!`

## Ayat 51

- `I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor in their own creation.`
- `I do not seek the aid of those who lead people astray.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This thing has been asserted to impress on the disbelievers that the satans were not entitled to their submission and worship, for they had no share at all in the creation of the heavens and the earth, nay, they themselves were the creation of Allah: therefore Allah alone was worthy of worship.

## Ayat 52

- `What will such people do on the Day when the Lord will say:`
  - `"Now call upon all those whom you believed to be My partners?"`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This theme has already been stated at several places in the Quran.
      - This is to impress that it is shirk to discard the commandments and the guidance of Allah and to follow the orders and guidance of any other than Allah, though one may not be professing with his tongue that there is any partner of Allah: nay, if one might be cursing others but at the same time following their orders instead of divine commandments, even then that one shall be guilty of shirk.
      - For instance, we see that everyone in this world curses satans but still follows them.
      - According to the Quran, in spite of cursing them, if people follow satans, they shall be guilty of setting up satans as partners with Allah. Though this will not be shirk in so many words, it will be tantamount to the practice of shirk and the Quran denounces this as shirk.
- `Thereupon they will call upon them, but they will not respond to their call;`
- `and We shall make them a common pit of doom,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Generally the commentators have assigned two meanings to this. 
    1. The one is the same that we have adopted in our translation and 
    2. the other is this: We will cause enmity between them. That is: Their friendship in this world shall be turned into bitter enmity in the Hereafter.

## Ayat 53

- `and the guilty shall behold the Fire`
- `and know that they are bound to fall into it,`
- `and will find no escape from it.`
