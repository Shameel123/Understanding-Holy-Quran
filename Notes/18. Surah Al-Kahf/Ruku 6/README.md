**Ayat  45 - 49**

## Ayat 45

- `(O Prophet), propound to them the parable of the present life:`
- `it is like the vegetation of the earth which flourished luxuriantly when it mingled with the water that We sent down from the sky,`
- `but after that the same vegetation turned into stubble which the winds blew about.`
- `Allah alone has the power over all things.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Allah has power over everything.
  - He gives life and also death, He causes the rise and the downfall. 
  - It is by His command that the seasons change.
  - Therefore, O disbelievers, if you are enjoying prosperity today, you should be under no delusion that this condition will remain forever.
  - That God, by Whose command these things have been bestowed on you, has the power to snatch away all this by another command.

## Ayat 46

- `Wealth and children are an adornment of the life of the world.`
- `But the deeds of lasting righteousness are the best in the sight of your Lord in reward, and far better a source of hope.`

## Ayat 47

- `Bear in mind the Day when We shall set the mountains in motion`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The mountains will begin to move about like clouds when the gravitation of the earth shall be brought to an end.
    - The Quran has described the same thing in( Surah An- Namal, Ayat 88 )in this way: **When you see the mountains, you consider them to be firmly fixed, but they shall be floating about like clouds at that time.**
- `and you will find the earth void and bare.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “You will see the earth as a leveled plain”: You will find no vegetation and no building on it and it will become a barren plain. It is the same thing that has been stated in (Ayat 8) of this chapter.
- `On that Day We shall muster all men together, leaving none of them behind.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, We will muster together every human being from the first man, Adam, to the last one born in the last moment of the Day of Resurrection: even that child which had breathed the first breath after its birth, shall be resurrected and all shall be mustered at one and the same tune.

## Ayat 48

- `They shall be brought before your Lord,`
- `all lined up,`
- `and shall be told:`
  - `"Now, indeed, you have come before Us in the manner We created you in the first instance,`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This thing will be addressed to those who denied the Hereafter, as if to say: Well, now you see that the information given by the Prophets has come out to be true.
      - They told you that Allah would bring you to life again as He first brought you out from the wombs of your mothers but you disbelieved in it. Now say whether you have been brought to life for the second time or not.
  - `although you thought that We shall not appoint a tryst (with Us)."`

## Ayat 49

- `And then the Record of their deeds shall be placed before them and you will see the guilty full of fear for what it contains, and will say:`
  - `"Woe to us! What a Record this is! It leaves nothing, big or small, but encompasses it."`
- `They will find their deeds confronting them.`
- **`Your Lord wrongs no one.`**
