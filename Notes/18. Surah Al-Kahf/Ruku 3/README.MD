**Ayat  18 - 22**

## Ayat 18

 - `On seeing them you would fancy them to be awake though they were asleep;`
 - `and We caused them to turn their sides to their right and to their left,`
   - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
     - That is, if someone could have looked at the seven persons from outside and seen them turning from one side to the other at intervals, he would have thought that they were not asleep but were relaxing themselves.
 - `and their dog sat stretching out its forelegs on the threshold of the Cave.`
 - `Had you looked upon them you would have certainly fled away from them,`
 - `their sight filling you with terror.`
   - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
     - Allah had so arranged their refuge that none dared go inside the cave and know about them for it was pitch dark in the cave and the dog was keeping watch at the entrance.
     - If someone ever looked into the cave and saw the sleepers, he took them for some robbers and at once turned on his heels.
     - This was the reason why their refuge remained a secret to the outer world for such a long period.

## Ayat 19

- `Likewise,`
- `We roused them in a miraculous way that they might question one another.`
- `One of them asked:`
  - `"How long did you remain (in this state)?"`
- `The others said:`
  - `"We remained so for a day or part of a day."`
- `Then they said:`
  - `"Your Lord knows better how long we remained in this state. Now send one of you to the city with this coin of yours and let him see who has the best food, and let him buy some provisions from there. Let him be cautious and not inform anyone of our whereabouts.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - They were awakened from their sleep in the same miraculous way that was employed in sending them to sleep and keeping them hidden from the outer world.

## Ayat 20

- `For if they should come upon us,`
- `they will stone us to death`
- `or force us to revert to their faith whereafter we shall never prosper."`

## Ayat 21

- `Thus did We make their case known to the people of the city`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The secret of their sleep was revealed when one of them went to Ephesus to buy food for them and offered a coin of the period of Emperor Decius.
    - As it was a changed world, he naturally attracted attention for he was wearing a costume of 300 year old fashion and spoke a language different from that in vogue.
    - This was because during those two centuries the language, culture, dress etc. had undergone a marked change.
    - So the shopkeeper looked askance at him and, according to a Syriac tradition, he suspected that he had dug up some ancient treasure.
    - Accordingly, he gathered some people of his neighborhood and they took him before the ruler.
    - On questioning, it was discovered that he was one of those followers of Christ, who had fled the city 300 years ago to save their faith.
    - As most of the population had embraced Christianity, the news immediately spread throughout the city and a big crowd of the people along with the Christian Roman Ruler, arrived at the cave.
    - It was then that the sleepers of the cave came to know that they had slept for about three hundred years.
    - So after making salutations to their Christian brothers they lay down and their souls left their bodies.
- `so that they might know that Allah's promise is true,`
- `and that there is absolutely no doubt that the Hour will come to pass.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - According to the Syriac tradition, at the time of this occurrence, hot discussions were going on in Ephesus about Resurrection and the Hereafter.
    - Though the people had embraced Christianity under the influence of the Roman Empire, yet traces of shirk and idolatry of the Romans and the effects of the Greek philosophy were still very powerful.
    - So in spite of the Christian creed of the Hereafter, many people denied this, or at least were skeptical about this. To add to this the Sadducee sect of the Jews, who formed a great part of the population of the city, openly denied the Hereafter and professed to base this on the Torah.
    - The Christian scholars, however, could not put forward any strong arguments to refute them: so much so that the reports of the polemical discussion given in Matthew, Mark and Luke, attributed to Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him), are admittedly very weak even according to the Christian scholars.
      - (Please refer to Matthew 22: 23-33, Mark 12: 18- 27, Luke 20: 27-40).
    - That is why the disbelievers in the Hereafter were having the upper hand and even the believers were being involved in doubts about it.
    - It was at that time that the sleepers of the cave were raised up and furnished an absolute proof of the life after death and turned the scales in favor of the believers in this dispute.
- `But instead of giving thought to this, they disputed with one another concerning the People of the Cave, some saying:`
  - `"Build a wall over them.`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - It appears from the context that this was the saying of the righteous people from among the Christians. They were of the opinion that a wall should be raised at the entrance of the cave in order to let the sleepers remain in the same condition in which they were, for they argued that their Lord alone knew best about their rank and position and the reward they deserved.
  - `Their Lord alone knows best about them."`
- `But those who prevailed over their affairs said:`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The people “those who prevailed in their matter” were the Roman rulers and the priests of the Christian Church, who did not let the righteous Christians have their way.
    - This was because by the middle of the fifth century, the common people, especially the orthodox among the Christians, had become fully involved in shirk and the worship of saints and tombs.
    - They used to visit the tombs of the saints to worship them and kept the statues of Jesus, Mary and the apostles in their churches: so much so that a few years before the rising up of the sleepers of the cave, in 431 A.D., a great council of the representatives of the Christian world had been held in Ephesus itself, in which it was resolved that the creed of the divinity of Christ and of Mary as the mother of God, should be included in the articles of the Christian Church.
    - If we keep in view the year 431, it becomes clear that by “those who prevailed in their matter” are meant the leaders of the Church and the officers of the government, who had the reins of the religious and political powers in their hands.
    - In fact these were the people who were the upholders of shirk and who decided that a mausoleum should be built over the cave of the sleepers to make it a place of worship.
  - `"We shall build a place of worship over them."`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - It is an irony that some people among the Muslims have misconstrued this verse of the Quran so as to make it lawful for themselves to build mausoleums, monuments and mosques over the tombs of the righteous persons and saints.
      - The Quran has, in fact, pointed out the deviation of the workers of iniquity who prevailed upon others and built a place of worship over the cave of the sleepers, who were indeed a sign of Resurrection and of the life after death.
      - But they abused this good opportunity and produced another means of practicing shirk.

## Ayat 22

- `Some will say concerning them:`
  - `"They were three and their dog, the fourth";`
- `and some will say:`
  - `"They were five, and their dog, the sixth" �`
- `all this being merely guesswork;`
- `and still others will say:`
  - `"They were seven, and their dog, the eighth."`
- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This shows that about three hundred years after this event, at the time of the revelation of the Quran, different stories had become current among the Christians about the sleepers of the cave, but generally these stories had no authentic source behind them.
  - This was because that was not the age of the press in which authentic books might have been published. Therefore naturally the stories of events were carried from place to place by means of oral traditions, and with the passage of time many tales of fiction got mixed up with the real story.
- `Say:`
  - `"My Lord knows their number best.`
  - `Only a few know their correct number.`
  - `So do not dispute concerning their number,`
  - `but stick to what is evident,`
  - `and do not question anyone about them."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is meant to impress that the real thing in this story is not the number of the sleepers but the lessons it teaches.
    1. A true believer should not on any account turn away from the truth and bow before falsehood.
    2. A believer should not merely rely on the material means but on Allah. He should trust in God and follow the right way, even though the outward adverse circumstances might appear to be unfavorable.
    3. It is wrong to suppose that Allah is bound by any so called law of nature, for He is able to do anything He wills even though that might seem to be against some common experience. He has the power to change any so called law of nature, whenever and wherever He wills and bring about any extraordinary supernatural thing. So much so that He can raise up anyone who might have been asleep for two hundred years, as if he had slept only for a few hours, without letting any change take place in his appearance, dress, health, indeed in anything, during the passage of time.
    4. This teaches us that Allah has the power to bring to life all the generations past, present and future all together as asserted by the Prophets and divine Scriptures.
    5. It teaches us that ignorant people have always been perverting the signs of Allah which are sent for the right guidance of the people. That is how the miracle of the sleepers of the cave, which had been shown as a proof of the Hereafter, had been turned into a means of shirk, as if they were some saints who had been sent only for this purpose.
