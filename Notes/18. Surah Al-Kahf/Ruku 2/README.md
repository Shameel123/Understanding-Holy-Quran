**Ayat  13 - 17**

## Ayat 13

- `We narrate to you their true story.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The oldest evidence of this story is found in a homily written in Syriac by Jacob of Sarug, a Christian priest of Syria, who was born in A.D. 452, a few years after the death of the companions of the cave.
    - The homily which describes the legend in great detail was composed by him in or about A.D. 474.
    - On the one hand, this same Syriac version came into the hands of our early commentators, and Ibn Jarir Tabari cited it in his commentary with various authorities.
    - And on the other hand, it reached Europe where its translations and abridged versions were published in Greek and Latin.
    - The abridged story as told by Gibbon in Chapter 33 of his The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire under the heading, “The Seven Sleepers”, so closely resembles the story told by our commentators that both the versions seem to have been drawn from the same source.
    - For instance, the name of the king, whose persecutions made the Seven Christian youths of Ephesus take refuge in the cave, was Emperor Decius according to Gibbon. He ruled the Roman Empire from A.D. 249 to 251 and whose reign is very notorious because of his persecution of the followers of Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him), while our commentators call him Decanus or Decaus, etc. The city, where this event happened was Aphesus or Aphesos according to our commentators, while according to Gibbon it was Ephesus, which was the biggest Roman city and seaport on the west coast of Asia Minor.
    - The ruins of this city can still be seen 20 to 25 miles south of the modern Turkish city of Izmir. Again the name of the king, during whose reign the companions of the cave awoke, was Tezusius according to the Muslim commentators and Theodosius II according to Gibbon. He ruled over Rome from A.D. 408 to 450, after the Roman Empire had accepted Christianity.
- `They were a party of young men who had faith in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The resemblance between the two versions is so close that even the name of the companion whom the sleepers sent to the city to buy food after waking up has been mentioned as Jamblicha by the Muslim scholars and Jamblichus by Gibbon.
    - The details of the story in both the versions are also similar which are briefly as follows.

## Ayat 14

- `and strengthened their hearts when they stood up and proclaimed:`
  - `"Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth.`
  - `We shall call upon no other god beside Him;`
  - `(for if we did so), we shall be uttering a blasphemy."`

## Ayat 15

- `(Then they conferred among themselves and said):`
  - `"These men, our own people, have taken others as gods beside Him:`
  - `why do they not bring any clear evidence that they indeed are gods?`
  - `Who can be more unjust than he who foists a lie on Allah?`

## Ayat 16

- `And now that you have dissociated yourselves from them and from whatever they worship beside Allah,`
- `go and seek refuge in the Cave.`
- `Your Lord will extend His mercy to you`
- `and will provide for you the means for the disposal of your affairs."`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - When these God worshiping youths fled the habitations to take refuge in the hills, the city of Ephesus was the principal center of idol worship and sorcery in Asia Minor.
  - There was a great temple dedicated to the goddess Diana, which was well known in the whole world and attracted devotees from far places.
  - The sorcerers, workers of magic and occult arts, soothsayers and amulet writers of Ephesus were well known and their black business had spread throughout Syria and Palestine, even as far as Egypt.
  - The Jews also had a big share in it, who attributed this art to Prophet Solomon. (Cyclopedia of Biblical Literature under Ephesus).
  - The predicament in which the righteous people living in an environment of idolatry and superstition were involved can well be imagined from the remark of the companions of the cave that occurs in( Ayat 20): If they succeed in over powering us, they will surely stone us to death or force us back into their faith.

## Ayat 17

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It has not been mentioned that in accordance with this mutual resolve, they left the city and went to a secret cave in the mountains in order to escape from death or forced apostasy.

- `Had you seen them in the Cave1`
- `it would have appeared to you that`
- `when the sun rose, it moved away from their Cave to the right;`
- `and when it set, it turned away from them to the left,`
- `while they remained in a spacious hollow in the Cave.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is to show that the mouth of the cave faced the north.
    - That is why the light of the sun could not enter inside the cave and the one who passed by it could not see who was inside it.
- **`This is one of the Signs of Allah.`**
- **`Whomsoever Allah guides, he alone is led aright;`**
- **`and whomsoever Allah lets go astray,`**
- `you will find for him no guardian to direct him.`
