## Ayat 30

- `The Jews say:`
  - `"Ezra ('Uzayr) is Allah's son,"`
- `and the Christians say:`
  - `"The Messiah is the son of Allah."`
- `These are merely verbal assertions in imitation of the sayings of those unbelievers who preceded them. `
- `May Allah ruin them.`
- `How do they turn away from the Truth?`

## Ayat 31

- `They take their rabbis and their monks for their lords apart from Allah,`
- `and also the Messiah, son of Mary,`
- `whereas they were commanded to worship none but the One True God.`
- `There is no god but He.`
- `Exalted be He above those whom they associate with Him in His Divinity.`

## Ayat 32

- `They seek to extinguish the light of Allah by blowing through their mouths;`
- `but Allah refuses everything except that He will perfect His light howsoever the unbelievers might abhor it.`

## Ayat 33

- `He it is Who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the True Religion`
- `that He may make it prevail over all religions,`
- `howsoever those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity might detest it.`

## Ayat 34

- `Believers!`
- `Many of the rabbis and monks wrongfully devour mankind's possessions and hinder people from the Way of Allah.`
- `And there are those who amass gold and silver and do not spend it in the Way of Allah.`
- `Announce to them the tidings of a painful chastisement`

## Ayat 35

- `on a Day when they shall be heated up in the Fire of Hell,`
- `and their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded with it, (and they shall be told):`
  - `"This is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves. Taste, then, the punishment for what you have hoarded."`

## Ayat 36

- `Surely the reckoning of months, in the sight of Allah, is twelve months,`
- `laid down in Allah's decree on the day when He created the heavens and the earth;`
- `and out of these months four are sacred.`
- `That is the true ordainment.`
- `Do not, therefore, wrong yourselves, with respect to these months.`
- `And fight all together against those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity in the manner that they fight against you all together,`
- `and know well that Allah is with the God-fearing.`

## Ayat 37

- `The intercalation (of sacred months) is an act of gross infidelity which causes the unbelievers to be led further astray.`
- `They declare a month to be lawful in one year and forbidden in another year in order that they may conform to the number of months that Allah has declared as sacred, and at the same time make lawful what Allah has forbidden.`
- `Their foul acts seem fair to them.`
- `Allah does not direct those who deny the Truth to the Right Way.`
