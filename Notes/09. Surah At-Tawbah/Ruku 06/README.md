**Ayat 38 - 42**


## Ayat 38

- `Believers!`
- `What is amiss with you that when it is said to you:`
  - `"March forth in the cause of Allah,"`
- `you cling heavily to the earth?`
- `Do you prefer the worldly life to the Hereafter?`
- `Know well that all the enjoyment of this world, in comparison with the Hereafter, is trivial.`

## Ayat 39

- `If you do not march forth,`
- `Allah will chastise you grievously and will replace you by another people,`
- `while you will in no way be able to harm Him.`
- `Allah has power over everything.`

## Ayat 40

- `It will matter little if you do not help the Prophet,`
- `for Allah surely helped him when the unbelievers drove him out of his home`
- `and he was but one of the two when they were in the cave,`
- `and when he said to his companion:`
  - **`"Do not grieve. Allah is with us."`**
- `Then Allah caused His tranquillity to descend upon him,`
- `and supported him with hosts you did not see,`
- `He humbled the word of the unbelievers.`
- `As for Allah's Word, it is inherently uppermost.`
- **`Allah is All-Powerful, All-Wise.`**

## Ayat 41

- `March forth whether light or heavy,`
- `and strive in the way of Allah with your belongings and your lives.`
- `That is best for you if you only knew it.`

## Ayat 42

- `Were it a gain at hand or a short journey, they would have surely followed you,`
- `but the distance seemed too far to them.`
- `Still they will swear by Allah:`
  - `"If only we could, we would surely have gone forth with you."`
- `They merely bring ruin upon themselves.`
- `Allah knows well that they are liars.`
