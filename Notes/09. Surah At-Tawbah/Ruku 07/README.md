**Ayat 43 - 59**


## Ayat 43

- `(O Prophet),`
- `may Allah forgive you!`
- `Why did you give them leave to stay behind before it became clear to you as to who were truthful and who were liars?`

## Ayat 44

- `Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will never ask your leave to be excused from striving (in the cause of Allah) with their belongings and their lives.`
- `Allah fully knows the God-fearing.`

## Ayat 45

- `It is only those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, and whose hearts are filled with doubt that seek exemption from striving (in the cause of Allah).`
- `They keep tossing to and fro in their doubt.`

## Ayat 46

- `Had they truly intended to march forth to fight, they would have certainly made some preparation for it.`
- `But Allah was averse to their going forth,`
- `so He made them lag behind,`

## Ayat 47

- `Had they gone forth with you, they would have only added to your trouble, and would have run about in your midst seeking to stir up sedition among you,`
- `whereas there are among you some who are prone to lend ears to them.`
- `Allah knows well the wrong-doers.`

## Ayat 48

- `Surely they sought even earlier to stir up sedition, and turned things upside down to frustrate you`
- `until the Truth came and the decree of Allah appeared,`
- `however hateful this may have been to them.`

## Ayat 49

- `And among them is he who says:`
- `"Grant me leave to stay behind, and do not expose me to temptation."`
- `Lo! They have already fallen into temptation.`
- `Surely Hell encompasses the unbelievers.`

## Ayat 50

- `If good fortune befalls you,`
- `it vexes them;`
- `and if an affliction befalls you, they turn away in jubilation and say:`
  - **`"We have taken due care of our affairs in good time."`**

## Ayat 51

- `Say:`
  - **`"Nothing will befall us except what Allah has decreed for us; He is our Protector."`**
- **`Let the believers, then, put all their trust in Allah.`**

## Ayat 52

- `Tell them:`
  - `"What you await to befall upon us is nothing but one of the two good things!`
  - `And what we await for you is that Allah visit you with chastisement from Him or chastise you at our hands.`
  - `So continue waiting; we too shall wait with you."`

## Ayat 53

- `Tell them:`
  - **`"Whether you spend your money willingly or unwillingly, it shall not find acceptance (with Allah) for you are an evil-doing folk."`**

## Ayat 54

- `Nothing prevents that their expendings be accepted except that they disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger,`
- `and whenever they come to the Prayer they do so lazily,`
- `and whenever they spend they do so grudgingly.`


## Ayat 55

- `Let neither their riches nor their children excite your admiration.`
- `Allah only wants to chastise them through these things in the present life,`
- `and to cause them to die while they are unbelievers.`

## Ayat 56

- `They swear by Allah that they are part of you whereas they are certainly not part of you.`
- `They are merely a people who dread you.`

## Ayat 57

- `If they could find any shelter or any cavern, or any retreat,`
- `they would turn around and rush headlong into it.`

## Ayat 58

- `(O Prophet), some of them find fault with you in the distribution of alms.`

## Ayat 59

- `Would that they were content with what Allah and His Messenger gave them, and were to say:`
  - **`"Allah suffices for us, and Allah will give us out of His bounty and so will His Messenger. It is to Allah alone that we turn with hope."`**
