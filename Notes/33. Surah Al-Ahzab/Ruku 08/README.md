**Ayat 59 - 68**

## Ayat 59

- `O Prophet, enjoin your wives and your daughters and the believing women, to draw a part of their outer coverings around them.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Jilbab is a large sheet and adna is to draw close and wrap up, but when this word is used with the associating particle ala, it gives the meaning of letting something down from above. Some modern translators, under the influence of the West, have translated this word “to wrap up” so as to avoid somehow the command about covering of the face. But if Allah had meant what these gentlemen want to construe, He would have said: yudnina ilai-hinna and not yudnina alai-hinna. Anyone who knows Arabic knows that yudnina alai-hinna cannot merely mean “wrapping up.” Moreover, the words min jalabib-i hinna also do not permit of this meaning. It is obvious that the preposition min here signifies a part of the sheet, and also that wrapping up is done by means of a whole sheet and not merely by a part of it. The verse, therefore, clearly means: “The women should wrap themselves up well in their sheets, and should draw and let down a part of the sheet in front of the face.”
- `It is likelier that they will be recognised and not molested.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This same meaning was understood by the major commentators who lived close to the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Ibn Jarir and Ibn al-Mundhir have related that Muhammad bin Sirin asked Ubaidah as- Salmani the meaning of this verse. (Ubaidah had become a Muslim in the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) but had not been able to visit him. He came to Madinah in the time of Umar and settled down there. He was recognized as equal in rank with Qadi Shuraih in jurisprudence and judicial matters). Instead of giving a verbal reply Ubaidah put on his sheet and gave a practical demonstration by covering his head and forehead and face and an eye, leaving only the other eye uncovered. Ibn Abbas also has made almost the same commentary. In his statements which have been reported by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Marduyah, he says: “Allah has commanded the women that when they move out of their houses for an outdoor duty, they should conceal their faces by drawing and letting down over themselves a part of their sheets, keeping only the eyes uncovered.” The same explanation of this verse has been given by Qatadah and Suddi.
- `Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - All the great commentators who have passed after the period of the companions and their immediate followers have given the same meaning of this verse. Imam Ibn Jarir Tabari, in his commentary of this verse, says: “The respectable women should not look like the slave-girls from their dress when they move out of their houses, with uncovered faces and loose hair; they should rather draw and let down over them a part of their sheets or outergarments so that no evil person may dare molest them.” (Jamial Bayan, vol. xxii, p. 33).

## Ayat 60

- `If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts there is a sickness,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Having diseased hearts” points to two kinds of evils:
      - (1) That a person should be an ill-wisher of Islam and the Muslims although he gets himself counted among the Muslims; and
- `and the scandal mongers in Madinah`
- `do not desist from their vile acts,`
- `We shall urge you to take action against them,`
- `and then they will hardly be able to stay in the city with you.`

## Ayat 61

- `They shall be cursed from all around and they shall be ruthlessly killed wherever they are seized.`

## Ayat 62

- `This has been Allah's Way with those who have gone before,`
- `and you shall find no change in Allah's Way.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “This is a permanent law of Allah’s Shariah that in an Islamic society and state such mischief-mongers are never given an opportunity to flourish and prosper. 
  - Whenever the system of society and state is established on divine law, such people will be warned to mend their ways and if they still persisted in their evil ways they would be severely dealt with and exterminated.”

## Ayat 63

- `People ask you concerning the Hour (of Resurrection).`
- `Say:`
- ``“Allah alone has knowledge of it. What do you know? Perhaps the Hour is nigh.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) was generally asked this question by the disbelievers and the hypocrites. By this they did not mean to obtain any knowledge but they did so out of fun and jest. As a matter of fact, they did not believe in the coming of the Hereafter at all; they regarded its concept as an empty threat only. 
  - They did not ask about the time of its coming so that they could set their affairs right, but what they really meant was: “O Muhammad (peace be upon him), we have been doing everything to frustrate your mission, and you have not been able to do any harm to us so far; now let us know as to when will Resurrection take place when we will be taken to task by Allah.”


## Ayat 64

- `Allah has cursed the unbelievers and has prepared for them a Blazing Fire;`

## Ayat 65

- `therein they shall abide for ever. They shall find none to protect or help them.`

## Ayat 66

- `On that Day when their faces shall be turned around in the Fire, they will say:`
  - `“Would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger.”`

## Ayat 67

- `They will say:`
  - `“Our Lord, we obeyed our chiefs and our great ones, and they turned us away from the Right Way.`

## Ayat 68

- `Our Lord, mete out to them a double chastisement and lay upon them a mighty curse.”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This thing has been stated at several places in the Quran. For instance, see (Surah Al-Aaraf: Ayat 187); (Surah An-Naziyat: Ayats 42-46); (Surah Saba: Ayats 3-5); (Surah Al- Mulk: Ayats 24-27); (Surah Al-Mutaffifin: Ayats 10-17); (Surah AI-Hijr: Ayats 2-3);(Surah Al-Furqan: Ayats 27-29);(Surah Ha Mim As-Sajdah: Ayats 26-29).
