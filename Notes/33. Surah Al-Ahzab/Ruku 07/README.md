**Ayat 53 - 58**

## Ayat 53

- `Believers,`
- `enter not the houses of the Prophet without his permission,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is an introduction to the general command that was given in (Surah An-Nur, Ayat 27) about a year later. In the ancient times the Arabs would enter one another’s house unceremoniously. If a person had to see another person he did not think it was necessary to call at the door or take permission for entry, but would enter the house and ask the womenfolk and children whether the master was at home or not, This custom of ignorance was the cause of many evils and would often give rise to some serious evils. Therefore, in the beginning a rule was made in respect of the houses of the Prophet (peace be upon him) that no person, whether a close friend or a distant relative, could enter there without permission. Then in Surah An-Nur a general command was given to enforce this rule for the houses of all the Muslims.
- `nor wait for a meal to be prepared;`
- `instead enter when you are invited to eat,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the second command in this connection. An uncivilized practice prevalent among the Arabs was that the visitors would call on a friend or acquaintance right at the time of the meals, or would come and prolong their stay till the meals time approached. This would often cause the master of the house great embarrassment. He could neither be so discourteous as to tell the visitors to leave because it was his meals time, nor could feed so many unexpected guests together. For it is not always possible for a person to arrange meals immediately for as many visitors as happened to call on him at a time. **Allah disapproved of this practice and commanded that the visitors should go for meals to a house only when invited.** This command did not in particular apply to the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) house only but the rules were in the beginning enforced in that model household so that they become general rules of etiquette in the houses of the other Muslims as well.
- `and when you have had the meal, disperse.`
- `Do not linger in idle talk.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This was to reform yet another foolish practice. The guests at a feast, after they had finished eating, would sit down to endless gossip and discussions much to the inconvenience of the people of the house. They would often embarrass the Prophet (peace be upon him) also by this practice, but he would forbear and forget. At last on the day of the marriage feast of Zainab the embarrassment thus caused crossed all limits. According to the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) special attendant, Anas bin Malik, the feast was held at night. Most of the people left after taking food but a couple or two of them got engaged in gossip. Disconcerted the Prophet (peace be upon him) rose and went round to his wives. When he returned he found the gentlemen still sitting. He turned back and sat in Aishah’s apartment. When a good deal of the night had passed he came to know that the gentlemen had left. Then he returned and went to the apartment of Zainab. After this it became inevitable that Allah Himself should warn the people of these evil practices. **According to Anas these verses were revealed on this occasion.** (Muslim, Nasai, Ibn Jarir).
- `That is hurtful to the Prophet but he does not express it out of shyness; but Allah is not ashamed of speaking out the Truth.`
- `And if you were to ask the wives of the Prophet for something, ask from behind a curtain. That is more apt for the cleanness of your hearts and theirs.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is the verse which is called **“the verse of the veil”**. Bukhari has related on the authority of Anas that before the coming down of this verse, Umar had made a suggestion several times to the Prophet (peace be upon him) to the effect: O Messenger of Allah, all sorts of the people, good and bad, come to visit you. Would that you commanded your wives to observe hijab. According to another tradition, once Umar said to the holy wives, **“If what I say concerning you is accepted, my eyes should never see you.”** But since the Prophet (peace be upon him) was not independent in making law, he awaited divine revelation. At last, this command came down that except for the mahram males as being stated in ( Ayat 55) below no other man should enter the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) houses, and whoever had to ask some thing from the ladies, should ask for it from behind a curtain. **After this command curtains were hung at the doors of the apartments of the wives,** and since the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) house was a model for the Muslims to follow, they too hung curtains at their doors. **The last sentence of the verse itself points out that whoever desire that the hearts of the men and women should remain pure, should adopt this way.**
- `It is not lawful for you to cause hurt to Allah's Messenger,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Now whosoever has been blessed with understanding by Allah can himself see that the Book which forbids the men and women to talk to each other face to face and commands them to speak from behind a curtain because “That is purer for your hearts and for their hearts,” could not possibly permit that the men and women should freely meet in mixed gatherings, educational and democratic institutions and offices, because it did not affect the purity of the hearts in any way. For him who does not want to follow the Quran, the best way would be that he should disregard its commands and should frankly say that he has no desire to follow it. But this would be the height of meanness that he should violate the clear commandments of the Quran and then stubbornly say that he is following the spirit of Islam which he has extracted. After all, what is that spirit of Islam which these people extract from sources outside the Quran and the sunnah?
- `nor to ever marry his wives after him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The allusion is to the false allegations that were being made in those days against the Prophet (peace be upon him), and some weak-minded Muslims also were joining the disbelievers and the hypocrites in doing this.
- `Surely that would be an enormous sin in Allah's sight.`

## Ayat 54

- `(It does not matter) whether you disclose something or conceal it, for Allah certainly knows everything.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, “If a person entertains an evil thought in his heart against the Prophet (peace be upon him), or harbors an evil intention about his wives, it will not remain hidden from Allah, and he will be punished for it.”

## Ayat 55

- `It will not be blameworthy for the wives of the Prophet`
- `if their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - For explanation, see (E.Ns 38 to 42 of Surah An-Nur). Allama Alusi’s commentary in this connection is also noteworthy. He says, “Brothers and sons of brothers and sisters include all those relatives who are unlawful for a woman, whether they are blood relations or foster relations. This list does not mention the paternal and maternal uncles because they are like the parents to the woman, or perhaps they have been left out because there was no need to mention them after mentioning their sons, For the reason for not observing hijab from the brother’s son and sister’s son is the same as of not observing it from the paternal and maternal uncles.” (Ruh al-Maani).
- `and the women with whom they have social relations,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - For explanation, see( E. N. 43 of Surah An-Nur).
- `and the persons whom their right hands possess enter their houses.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - For explanation, see (E. N. 44 of Surah An-Nur).
- `(O women), shun disobeying Allah. Allah is watchful over everything.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It means this: “After the coming down of this absolute command no person outside the circle of the relatives, who have been made an exception, should be allowed to enter the houses without hijab being observed from them,” Another meaning is: “The woman should never adopt the attitude that they should observe hijab when the husband is present, but should appear without hijab before the other men, when he is away. Such a conduct may remain hidden from the husband but not from Allah.”


## Ayat 56

- `Allah and His angels bless the Prophet.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Allah’s sending His blessings on His Prophet, means this: Allah is very kind to His Prophet (peace be upon him): He praises him, blesses his work, exalts his name, and showers His mercy on him.
    - Blessings of the angels, means: They love the Prophet (peace be upon him) most dearly and pray to Allah to bless him with the highest ranks, cause his religion and Shariah to flourish and exalt him to the laudable position.
    - One can clearly see from the context, why this thing has been said here.
    - This was the time when the enemies of Islam were making all sorts of false allegations against the Prophet (peace be upon him) in order to satisfy their jealousy on the success of faith. By sullying him, they thought they would destroy his moral influence through which Islam and the Muslims were gaining more and more ground every day. Such were the conditions when Allah sent down this verse, as if warn the people: “However hard the disbelievers and the hypocrites and the polytheists might try to vilify and slander My Prophet (peace be upon him) with a view to frustrating his mission, they are bound to suffer disgrace and humiliation in the end, for I am kind to him, and the angels, who are administering the entire universe, are his supporters and admirers. His enemies cannot gain anything by their condemnation of him because I am exalting his name and My angels are adoring him constantly. They cannot harm him by their mean machinations when My mercy and blessings are with him, and My angels pray for him day and night to the effect: “O Lord of the worlds, raise Muhammad (peace be upon him) to even higher ranks and make his religion flourish and prosper.”
- `Believers, invoke blessings and peace on him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - In other words, it means this: O people, who have found the right path through Muhammad (peace be upon him), the Messenger of Allah, you should recognize his true worth and be grateful to him for his great favors to you.
      - You were lost in the darkness of ignorance, he afforded you the light of knowledge.
      - You had become morally bankrupt, he raised you high on the moral level so that the people now feel envious of you.
      - You had sunk to barbarism and savagery, he adorned you with the most refined human civilization.
    - The disbelievers everywhere have turned his enemies only because he has done you these favors; otherwise personally he has not done any harm to anyone. Therefore, the inevitable demand of your gratitude to him is that you should regard him with an equal, or even greater love than the malice and grudge these people display against him; that you should show a greater attachment to him than the hatred these people show towards him; that you should praise and adore him even more fervently than they condemn him; that you should wish him well even more heartily than they wish him ill, and pray for him just as the angels do day and night, saying: “O Lord of the worlds: Just as Your Prophet has done us countless and endless favors, so do You also show him endless and limitless mercy, raise him to the highest ranks in the world and bless him with the greatest nearness to Yourself in the hereafter.”


## Ayat 57

- `Verily those who cause annoyance to Allah and His Messenger Allah has cursed them in this world and in the Hereafter and has prepared for them a humiliating chastisement.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “To cause harm to Allah” implies two things:
    - That Allah should be disobeyed, that an attitude of disbelief and shirk and atheism be adopted with regard to Him, and that things made unlawful by Him be made lawful; and
    - that His Messenger be troubled, for just as obedience to the Messenger is obedience to Allah, so is opposition and disobedience of the Messenger opposition and disobedience of Allah.

## Ayat 58

- `Those who cause hurt to believing men and to believing women have invited upon themselves a calumny and a manifest sin.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse determines the definition of slander. It is to ascribe a fault to a person which he does not have, or an error which he has not committed. The Prophet (peace be upon him) also has explained it.
  - **According to Abu Daud and Tirmidhi, when he was asked as to what is ghibat (backbiting), he replied: “It is to make mention of your brother in a manner derogatory to him.” The questioner said, “And if the fault is there in my brother?” The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: “If the fault that you mentioned is there in him, you backbite him; if it is not there, you slandered him.”**
  - Such an act is not only a moral sin, which will entail punishment in the Hereafter, but this verse also requires that also in the law of an Islamic State false allegation should be held as a culpable offense.
