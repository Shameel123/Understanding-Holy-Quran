**Ayat 01 - 08**


## Ayat 01

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - As we have mentioned in the introduction to the Surah, these verses were sent down at a time when Zaid had already divorced Zainab. The Prophet (peace be upon him) was himself feeling, and Allah had also inspired him with this, that it was the right time for striking at the root of the tradition and customs of ignorance regarding the adopted relations, and that he should take the initiative and marry the divorced wife of his adopted son (Zaid) so that the custom was completely eradicated.
  - But the reason why he was hesitant in this regard was the fear that this would provide a strong excuse to the disbelievers and the hypocrites; who were already burning with jealousy at his successive victories, to start a propaganda campaign against him.
  - This fear was not due to any apprehension for personal defamation, but for the reason that it would harm Islam; it would cause mistrust of Islam among the people who were inclined towards it; it would make the neutral people to join the enemy; and it would cause the weak minded people among the Muslims to be involved in doubts and suspicions.
  - Therefore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) thought it was unwise to take a step for the eradication of a custom of ignorance, which would harm the greater interests and objectives of Islam.

- `O Prophet,`
- `fear Allah and do not obey the unbelievers and the hypocrites.`
- `Verily Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In the very first sentence, in the beginning of the discourse, Allah removed all the apprehensions of the Prophet (peace be upon him), as if to say: “We know better what is useful and beneficial for our religion and what is not. We know what would be wise and what unwise in this regard. Therefore, you should not behave in a manner which would suit the disbelievers and the hypocrites, but you should behave in a manner which is according to Our Will. You should fear Us and not the disbelievers and the hypocrites.”

## Ayat 02

 - `Follow that which is revealed to you from your Lord.`
 - `Verily Allah is fully aware of all that you do.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This sentence is addressed to the Prophet (peace be upon him) as well as to the Muslims and the opponents of Islam. It means: “If the Prophet (peace be upon him) earns defamation by acting according to the command of Allah, and bears patiently the attacks of the enemy on his honor, his devoted and sincere services will not remain hidden from Allah.
  - The state of the Muslims who remain steadfast in their loyalty to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and of those who are involved in doubts and suspicions will be known to Allah. And Allah will also not remain unaware of the attempts of the disbelievers and the hypocrites who try to defame the Prophet (peace be upon him).”

## Ayat 03

- `Put your trust in Allah:`
  - `Allah is sufficient as Guardian.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The addressee of this sentence is again the Prophet (peace be upon him). He is being instructed to the effect: “Carry out the duty that is being entrusted to you with full confidence in Allah, and do not care at all even if the whole world turns hostile against you.”
  - When a man comes to know with certainty that a certain command has been given by Allah, he should have the satisfaction that his whole well being and his good lies in its compliance. Then, it is not for him to see and understand its wisdom, but he should carry it out with full confidence in Allah. Allah is enough for him that the servant should entrust all his affairs to Him. He is enough for his guidance as well as help, and He alone is also responsible that the one working under His guidance should never meet with evil consequences.

## Ayat 04

- `Allah has never put two hearts within one person's body;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, one and the same person cannot be a believer and a hypocrite, truthful and false, wicked and righteous, at one and the same time.
    - **He does not have two hearts in this chest that one should have sincerity in it and the other fearlessness of God.**
    - Therefore, a man can have only one kind of character at a time: either he will be a believer or a hypocrite, a disbeliever or a Muslim. Now if you call a believer a hypocrite, or a hypocrite a believer, it will not change the reality. The true character of the person will inevitably remain the same.
- `nor has He made your wives, whom you compare to your mothers' backs (to divorce them), your true mothers;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Zihar is a term in Arabic. In old days when an Arab; in the heat of a domestic quarrel, would say to his wife: “Your back for me is as the back of my mother,” it was thought that the woman was no longer lawful for him because he had compared her to his mother. 
    - About this Allah says: **“A woman does not become a man’s mother just because he has called her his mother or compared her to his mother. His mother is the woman who bore him. Only his calling his wife his mother cannot change the reality.”** See (Surah Al- Mujadilah: Ayats 2-4).
- `nor has He made those whom you adopt as sons your own sons.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This is what is intended to be said. The two preceding sentences are meant to support and emphasize this same point.
- `These are only words that you utter with your mouths.`
- `But Allah proclaims the Truth and directs you to the Right Path.`

## Ayat 05

- `Call your adopted sons after their true fathers; that is more equitable in the sight of Allah.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The first reform introduced in connection with the implementation of this command was that Zaid, the adopted son of the Prophet (peace be upon him), began to be called Zaid bin Harithah, after his real father, instead of Zaid bin Muhammad. Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi and Nasai have related this tradition from Abdullah bin Umar that in the beginning the people called him Zaid bin Muhammad. 
    - After the revelation of this verse they began calling him Zaid bin Harithah. Moreover, after this revelation it was forbidden that a person should assign his parentage to any other man than his own real father. Bukhari, Muslim and Abu Daud have related on the authority of Saad bin Abi Waqqas that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Paradise is forbidden for the one who called himself son of another person than his own father.” Other traditions bearing on the subject have been related in Ahadith, which have regarded this as a heinous sin.
- `But if you do not know their true fathers, then regard them as your brethren in faith and as allies.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, even in such a case it will not be right to ascribe the parentage of a person to someone else.
- **`You will not be taken to task for your mistaken utterances, but you will be taken to task for what you say deliberately.`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It means: there is no harm if a person is called a son out of love. Likewise, there is no sin if someone calls another one a mother, or a daughter, or sister or brother, etc. out of affection and regard, but if such a thing is said with the intention that the one being called so will be accorded the same status and position and rights and privileges as actually belong to these relations, it would certainly be objectionable and one will be held answerable for it.”
- **`Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate.`**
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Allah has forgiven the errors already committed in this regard; no one will be called to account for them. Another meaning is: Allah does not call a people to account for actions done unintentionally. He will not punish a person for doing something which he did not do intentionally, although apparently it resembled a forbidden act.

## Ayat 06

- `Surely the Prophet has a greater claim over the believers than they have over each other,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the relationship of the Prophet (peace be upon him) with the Muslims and of the Muslims with the Prophet (peace be upon him) is of a superior nature, over and above all human relationships.
    - No other relationship is in any way comparable with the relationship that exists between the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the believers.
    - The Prophet (peace be upon him) is more compassionate and affectionate and a greater well-wisher of the Muslims than their own parents, even their own selves.
    - Their parents and their wives and children can harm them, can treat them in a selfish manner and mislead them, can make them commit errors and mistakes, can push them into Hell, but the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) case is different: he will do for them only that which results in and leads to their eternal well-being and enduring happiness. They can commit follies resulting in their own ruin and disaster, but the Prophet (peace be upon him) will wish for them only that which is beneficial and useful for them.
    - And when it is so, the Prophet (peace be upon him) also has a right on the Muslims that they should regard him dearer than their own parents, their own children, even their own selves. They should love him more than anything and anybody else in the world; should prefer his judgment and opinion to their own and should submit to every command that he gives.
    - The same thing has been said by the Prophet (peace be upon him) in a Hadith, which Bukhari and Muslim and others have related with a little difference in wording: **“No one of you can be a believer until I become dearer to him than his own father and his own children and all mankind.”**
- `and his wives are their mothers.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - On the basis of the special relationship mentioned above, another characteristic of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is that his wives are forbidden to the Muslims just like their own real mothers although their adopted mothers are in no sense their real mothers. This thing is peculiar only to the person of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and of no other man in the world.
- `According to the Book of Allah, blood relatives have greater claim over each other than the rest of the believers and the Emigrants (in the cause of Allah), except that you may do some good to your allies (if you so wish).`
- `This is inscribed in the Book of Allah.`

## Ayat 07

- `And call to mind, (O Prophet), when We took the covenant from all Prophets;`
- `and also from you and Noah and Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary.`
  - Does this mean that the covenant taken from these Prhophets had a difference than the other ones? (My thought)
- `We took from them a solemn covenant`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Allah in this verse has reminded the Prophet (peace be upon him) that, like all other Prophets, He has taken from him too a solemn covenant which he should abide by strictly. A study of the preceding verse shows that the covenant implies: “The Prophet will first himself obey and follow every command received from Allah, and then make others also to obey and follow it: he will convey Allah's commands intact to others and will show no laxity in the struggle to enforce them practically.” This covenant has been mentioned at several other places in the Quran, e.g.

## Ayat 08

- `so that (their Lord) may question the truthful about their truthfulness.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, Allah has not just taken the covenant but will also question as to how far it has been kept. Then only those who will have kept Allah's covenant faithfully, will be declared to be the truthful.
- `As for the unbelievers, He has kept a painful chastisement in store for them.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - To understand the theme of (Ayats 1-8) fully, these should be read together with (Ayats 36-41 of this Surah).
