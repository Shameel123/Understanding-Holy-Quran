**Ayat 09 - 20**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - In( Ayats 9-27), an appraisal has been made of the battle of the Trench and the raid against the Bani Quraizah. These were revealed at the end of the raid. One should keep the details of these events in view as given in the introduction above.


## Ayat 09

- `Believers,`
- `call to mind Allah's favour to you when enemy hosts invaded you.`
- `Then We sent against them a wind and hosts that you did not see`
- `although Allah was observing all that you were then doing.`

- Tafhim-ul-Quran:
  - The windstorm did not lash the enemy forces immediately on their arrival but it occurred while the siege of Al-Madinah had lasted about a month.
  - “Armies whom you did not see” implies the hidden powers which operate in the affairs of men under Allah’s command and of which men are totally unaware.
  - Man regards the occurrence of events and incidents as resulting from apparent causes and does not take into account the hidden forces at work, whereas in most cases these very hidden forces play the decisive role.
  - As these forces function under the command of Allah’s angels, the “armies” may imply the angels as well though there is no indication here of sending the armies of the angels.

## Ayat 10

- `When they came upon you from above you and from below you,`
- `when your eyes were stupefied with horror and your hearts leapt to your throats,`
- `and you began to entertain diverse thoughts about Allah.`

- Tafhim-ul-Quran:
  - It may mean: The enemies came upon you from every side, and also that those coming from Najd and Khaiber came from above and those coming from Makkah from below you.”

## Ayat 11

- `The believers were then put to a severe test and were most violently convulsed.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “The believers”: All those who accepted the Prophet (peace be upon him) as Allah’s Messenger and became included among his followers, which comprised both the true believers and the hypocrites.
  - In this paragraph Allah has made mention of the Muslim community as a whole. 
  - In the following three paragraphs the attitude of the hypocrites has been commented upon, and the next two deal with the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the true believers.

## Ayat 12

- `And call to mind when the hypocrites and all those with diseased hearts said:`
  - `“All that Allah and His Messenger had promised us1 was nothing but deceit.”`

## Ayat 13

- `And when a section of them said:`
  - `“(O people of Yathrib), now there is no place for you to stay, so turn back.”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - This sentence has two meanings: The apparent meaning is that there is no chance for them to stay at the Trench against the polytheists; therefore, they should return to the city. **And the hidden meaning is that there is no chance for them to remain in Islam;** therefore, they should return to their ancestral religion, so that they might escape the danger in which they had involved themselves by earning the hostility of the whole of Arabia.
      - The hypocrites uttered such mischievous things so that they could make the one who would listen to them understand the intended hidden meaning, but in case someone took exception to their words, they could say they had been misunderstood.
- `(And call to mind) when a section of them was seeking permission from the Prophet to leave, saying:`
  - `“Our houses are exposed (to attack),”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - That is, when the Bani Quraizah also joined the invaders, the hypocrites had a good excuse for defection and they started asking the Prophet (peace be upon him) for leave to go and protect their houses and families, which, they said, had been endangered, whereas at that time the Prophet (peace be upon him) was responsible for the defense and protection of all the people of Al-Madinah. After the treachery of the Quraizah it was for the Prophet (peace be upon him) to devise plans for the protection of the city and its people and not of the soldiers of the army individually.
- `although they were not exposed (to attack);`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, the Prophet (peace be upon him) had already made arrangements for protection against the danger, which were a part of the collective scheme of defense being implemented by him as commander of the Islamic forces. Therefore, there was no immediate danger in the face of which these people could justifiably make such an excuse.
- `they only wished to flee (from the battle-front).`

## Ayat 14

- `If the enemy were to enter the town from various directions, and they were summoned to act treacherously, they would have succumbed to it and would have shown little reluctance in doing so.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - “Exhorted to treachery”: Urged by the disbelievers to join them to vanquish the Muslims after entering the city as conquerors.

## Ayat 15

- `They had earlier covenanted with Allah that they would not turn their backs in flight.`
- `And a covenant made with Allah must needs be answered for.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, they had felt regret at the weakness they had shown on the occasion of the battle of Uhud and pledged to Allah that they would compensate for their error in any trial that they would confront in the future. But Allah cannot be deceived by empty words. He puts to one or the other test everyone who makes a pledge with Him so that his sincerity of intention or otherwise is found out. Therefore, just after two years of the battle of Uhud, He made them confront an even more serious danger and discovered how far they were sincere in their pledge.

## Ayat 16

- `(O Prophet), tell them:`
  - `“If you run away from death or slaying, this flight will not avail you. You will have little time after that to enjoy (the pleasures of life).”`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, this flight of yours will not add anything to your life. In no case will you live forever and gain the whole wealth of the world. Hardly a few years will you live after your flight and enjoy life only as long as it is destined for you.

## Ayat 17

- `Say (to them):`
  - `“Who can protect you from Allah if He desires an evil for you?`
  - `And who can prevent Him if He desires to show mercy to you?”`
- `They shall find none other than Allah to be their protector or helper.`

## Ayat 18

- `Allah knows well those of you who create obstructions (in war efforts) and say to their brethren:`
  - `“Come and join us.”`
- `They hardly take any part in battle.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - That is, abandon this Prophet (peace be upon him) and do not become involved in dangers and afflictions only for the sake of the faith and truth. Live a life of ease and comfort as we do.

## Ayat 19

- `They are utterly niggardly1 (in coming to your aid).`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - “Being miserly”: Those who are not at all willing to spend their energies, their time, their wealth, etc. in any way in which the true believers are spending whatever they have. Not to speak of exerting themselves and braving the dangers, they do not want to cooperate with the believers in anything with an open heart.
- `Whenever there is danger, you will see them looking at you, their eyes rolling as though they were on the verge of fainting at the approach of death. But when the danger passes away, their greed for wealth prompts them to greet you with their sharp, scissor-like tongues.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Lexically, this verse has two meanings:
      - (1) When you return victorious from a war, they receive you warmly, and try to impress you with a sweet tongue that they too are sincere believers and they too have made their contribution to promote the cause of Islam, and therefore, they deserve a share from the booty.
      - (2) If victory is attained, these people show great powers of the tongue at the time of the division of the spoils and make great demands for their shares, recounting their services for the cause of Islam.
- **`These are the ones who never truly believed, and so Allah has caused their deeds to be reduced to naught.`**
- `That is easy enough for Allah.`

## Ayat 20

- `They think that the invading confederates have not yet gone.`
- `But if the confederates were to mount another assault, they would wish to be in the desert among the bedouins and keep themselves informed about you from there.`
- `But even if they remained in your midst, hardly would they fight.`
