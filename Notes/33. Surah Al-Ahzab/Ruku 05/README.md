**Ayat 35 - 40**

- `Surely`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Presentation of this theme immediately after the foregoing paragraph contains a subtle allusion to the fact that the instructions given above to the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) wives are not exclusively meant for them but the Muslim society as a whole should reform itself in accordance with them.
- `the men who submit (to Allah) and the women who submit (to Allah),`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Who have surrendered themselves to Allah: Who have accepted Islam as a code of life for themselves, and have decided to follow it in their lives, and who have no wish to resist the Islamic way of life and thought, but have adopted the way of obedience and submission to it.
- `the men who have faith and the women who have faith,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Who are believing: Whose obedience is not merely outward, nor unwilling but who sincerely regard the guidance given by Islam as based on the truth. Whose faith is that the way shown by the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the only right and straight way. And in following which alone lies their true success. That which has been declared as wrong by Allah and His Prophet (peace be upon him) is certainly wrong. And that which has been declared as right by Allah and His Prophet (peace be upon him) is certainly right. Also, psychologically and intellectually, they do not regard as improper any injunction that has been enjoined by the Quran and Sunnah, and do not remain on the lookout to change it somehow to suit their own desires or mold it according to the current trends of the world, avoiding at the same time the blame that they have effected a change in the command given by Allah and His Prophet (peace be upon him).
    - The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) has described the true state of faith in a Hadith in these words: **“He who reconciled himself to Allah as his Lord and to Islam as his way of Life and to Muhammad as his Messenger, has the true taste of faith.”** (Sahih Muslim).
    - In another Hadith, he has explained it thus: **“None of you becomes a believer until the desires of his self become subordinate to what I have brought.”** (Sharh-as- Sunnah).ave forbidden as bad but would go on following the same in practical life.
- `the men who are obedient and the women who are obedient,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they do not rest content with mere belief but are obedient practically also. They are not the sort of the people who would honestly believe that what Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) have commanded was true but would violate it in practice: that they would sincerely regard what Allah and His Messenger h
- `the men who are truthful and the women who are truthful;`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, hey are truthful in their speech and honest in thou dealings. They do not deal in lies, deceptions, frauds and forgeries. They utter with their tongues only what their conscience approves as true. They practice and perform only what they honestly find to be in accordance with righteousness and truth, and they are honest in all their dealings with others.
- `the men who are steadfast and the women who are steadfast,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they patiently and steadfastly bear and face all the obstacles, dangers, difficulties and losses that they might have to encounter in following the right way taught by Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) and in establishing Allah’s religion in the world; no fear and no temptation and no desire of the self can succeed in diverting them from the right way.
- `the men who humble themselves (to Allah) and the women who humble themselves (to Allah),`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, they are free from pride, vanity and haughtiness: they have full understanding of the reality that they arc servants and they have no other position than that of servitude. Therefore, their hearts as well as their bodies remain bowed before Allah, dominated by fear of Him. They never display the attitude which is the hallmark of the lives of those who are fearless of God and arc involved in arrogance. From the sequence it appears that the mention of Khushu (expression of humility) in particular along with the general attitude of the fear of God implies the Prayer, for the mention of the practice of charity and fast has been made just after it.
- `the men who give alms and the women who give alms,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This does not only imply payment of the obligatory Zakat, but it also includes general charity. It means to say that they spend their wealth freely in the way of Allah and they are not at all niggardly in the matter of helping the servants of Allah as much as they can. No orphan and no sick or afflicted person, no weak or disabled person, no poor and needy one remains deprived of their support in their dwelling; and if there arises the need for monetary help for promoting the cause of Allah’s religion, they are never miserly in spending their wealth for that purpose.
- `the men who fast and the women who fast,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This includes both the obligatory and the voluntary fasts.
- `the men who guard their chastity and the women who guard their chastity,`
- `the men who remember Allah much and the women who remember Allah much:`
- `for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and a mighty reward.`

## Ayat 36

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - It1 does not behove a believer, male or female, that when Allah and His Messenger have decided an affair they should exercise their choice. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has strayed to manifest error.2

- `It does not behove a believer, male or female, that when Allah and His Messenger have decided an affair they should exercise their choice.`
- `And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has strayed to manifest error.`


- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Ibn Abbas, Qatadah, Ikrimah and Muqatil bin Hayyan say that this verse was revealed at the time when the Prophet (peace be upon him) proposed to Zainab for Zaid, and Zainab and her relatives did not agree.
  - According to Ibn Abbas, when the Prophet (peace be upon him) made the proposal, Zainab said, **“I am better than him in lineage.”**
  - Ibn Saad says that she also said, "I do not approve him for myself. I am a Quraishite by birth. The same sort of disapproval was expressed by her brother, Abdullah bin Jahsh, because Zaid was a freed slave of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and Zainab was the daughter of his paternal aunt, Umaimah bint Abdul Muttalib. They did not like the Prophet (peace be upon him) to propose a girl of a noble Quraishite family, who was none other than his own first cousin, for his freed slave.
  - At this, this verse was sent down and on hearing it Zainab and all her relatives yielded to the proposal at once.
  - Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) married them, paid ten diners and 60 dirhams from his own pocket as dower on behalf of Zaid, provided the bridal dress and sent some articles of food for domestic use.


## Ayat 37

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - The discourse from here to ( verse 48) was sent down after the Prophet (peace be upon him) had married Zainab, and the hypocrites, the Jews and the mushriks had started a relentless propaganda campaign against him.
  - While studying these verses one should bear in mind the fact that this divine discourse was not meant for the instruction of the enemies who were engaged in a willful campaign of vilification and slander and falsehood to defame the Prophet (peace be upon him) intentionally and to satisfy their rancor.
  - **But its real object was to protect the Muslims against the influence of their campaign and to safeguard them against doubts and suspicions.**
  - Evidently, the word of Allah could not satisfy the unbelievers. It could give peace of mind only to those who knew and believed it to be Allah’s word. There was a danger that those righteous people also might be confused and influenced by the objections that were being raised by their enemies. Therefore, on the one hand, Allah removed all possible doubts from their minds, and on the other, taught the Muslims as well as the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself how they should conduct themselves under the circumstances.

- `(O Prophet),`
- `call to mind when you said to him`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - It refers to Zaid as has been mentioned clearly below.
    - In order to understand how Allah and the Prophet (peace be upon him) had favored him, it is necessary here to relate his story briefly.
    - He was the son of Harithah bin Shurahbil, a person of the Kalb tribe, and his mother, Suda bint Thalabah, was from the Bani Maan, a branch of the Tay tribe. When he was eight years old, she took him along to her parents. There the people of Bani Qain bin Jasr raided their camp, plundered their goods and took some men prisoners including Zaid. Then they sold Zaid at the fair of Ukiiz near Taif. His buyer was Hakim bin Hizam, a nephew of Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her). Hakim brought him to Makkah and presented him to his paternal aunt. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) married Khadijah, he found Zaid in her service and was so impressed by his good manners and conduct that he asked her to give Zaid to him. Thus, this fortunate boy entered the service of the best of men, whom Allah, after a few years, was going to appoint a Prophet (peace be upon him). Zaid at that time was 15 years old. Afterwards, when his father and uncle came to know that their child was at Makkah, they came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and requested him to return him in exchange for a payment. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, **“I shall call the boy and leave it to him whether he would like to go with you or stay with me. If he chose to go, I would take no payment but would let him go with you. However, if he chose to stay back, I am not the one who would send away a person who would like to stay with me.”** They said, **“This is perfectly right and just. Please ask the boy.”** The Prophet (peace be upon him) called Zaid and asked him: **“Do you know these two gentlemen?”** He said, **“Yes, this is my father and this is my uncle.”** The Prophet (peace be upon him) then said, **“Well, you know them as well as me. You have the choice to go with them, or stay with me if you so desire.”** He said, **“I have no wish to leave you and go with anyone else.”** His father and uncle said: **“Zaid, will you prefer slavery to freedom, and choose to stay with others in preference to your parents and family?”** He replied, **“After what I have seen of this person, I cannot prefer anything else of the world over him.”** Hearing this reply, the father and uncle of Zaid were reconciled to his remaining with the Prophet (peace be upon him). The Prophet (peace be upon him) set Zaid free immediately and proclaimed before a gathering of the Quraish in the Kabah, **“Bear witness that hence forth Zaid is my son: he will receive inheritance from me and I from him.”** Thereafter, he began to be called **Zaid bin Muhammad** by the people. 
    - All this happened before the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) advent as a Prophet. Then, when he was blessed with Prophethood by Allah, there were four persons who accepted his claim to it without a moment’s hesitation as soon as they heard of it from him. They were
      - Khadijah,
      - Zaid,
      - Ali and
      - Abu Bakr
      - (may Allah be pleased with them all).
    - Zaid was 30 years old then, and had already spent 15 years in the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) service. In the fourth year after Hijrah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) married him to his first cousin Zainab, paid her dower on his behalf and provided them with necessary articles for setting up the house.
    - This is to what Allah has alluded in the verse, saying: “Upon whom Allah has bestowed favor, and upon whom you (O Muhammad) have done favor.”
- `whom Allah had favoured and you had favoured:`
  - `“Cleave to your wife and fear Allah,”`
    - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
      - These words were said when the relations between Zaid and Zainab had become very strained, and after making repeated complaints Zaid had finally told the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he intended to divorce her.
      - Although Zainab had accepted to be married to him in obedience to Allah and His Messenger’s command, she could not overcome her feeling that Zaid was a freed slave, who had been brought up by her own family, and she in spite of being the daughter of a noble Arab family, had been wedded to him.
      - Due to this feeling she could never regard Zaid as her equal in matrimonial life, and this caused more and more bitterness between them. Thus after a little more than a year the marriage ended in divorce.
- `and you concealed within yourself for fear of people what Allah was to reveal, although Allah has greater right that you fear Him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - Some people have misconstrued this sentence to mean this: The Prophet (peace be upon him) desired to marry Zainab and wanted that Zaid should divorce her. But when Zaid came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said that he wanted to divorce his wife, the Prophet (peace be upon him) stopped him from this only half heartedly.
    - At this Allah said: **“You were keeping hidden in your heart that which Allah intended to reveal.”**. The real meaning, however, is contrary to this. If this the sentence is read with (verses 1, 2, 3 and7 of this Surah), one can clearly see that in the very days when bitterness was increasing between Zaid and his wife, Allah had hinted to His Prophet (peace be upon him) that when Zaid had divorced his wife, he would have to marry the divorced lady. But since the Prophet (peace be upon him) knew what it meant to marry the divorced wife of the adopted son in the contemporary Arab society, and that too at a time when apart from a handful of the Muslims the entire country had become jealous of him, he was hesitant to take any step in that direction. That is why when Zaid expressed his intention to divorce his wife, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him, **“Fear Allah and do not divorce your wife.”** What he meant by this was that Zaid should not divorce his wife so that he was saved from facing the trial, otherwise in case the divorce was pronounced he would have to comply with the command, and thus provoke a severe storm of criticism and vilification against himself. But when the Prophet (peace be upon him) deliberately forbade Zaid to divorce his wife so that he himself might be saved from what he feared would cause him defamation, Allah found this below the high position that He wanted His Prophet to enjoy, whereas Allah intended to effect a great reform through this marriage of the Prophet. The words **“And you feared the people, while Allah has more right that you should fear Him,”** clearly point to the same theme.
    - The same explanation of this verse has been given by Imam Zain-ul-Aabedin Ali bin Husain (may Allah be pleased with him). He says, Allah had indicated to His Prophet (peace be upon him) that Zainab would be included among his wives. But when Zaid complained about her to him, the Prophet (peace be upon him) admonished him to fear Allah and keep his wife. At this Allah said to His Prophet, “I had informed you that I would give Zainab you to in marriage. But when you were forbidding Zaid to divorce his wife, you were hiding that which Allah was going to reveal.” (Ibn Jarir, Ibn Kathir on the authority of Ibn Abi Hatim).
    - Allama Alusi in his Ruh-al-Maani has also given the same meaning of it. He says, “This is an expression of displeasure on abandoning the better course, which was that the Prophet (peace be upon him) should have kept quiet, or should have told Zaid to do as he liked. The displeasure amounted to this: “Why did you tell Zaid to keep his wife, whereas I had informed you beforehand that Zainab would be included among your wives?”
- `So when Zayd had accomplished what he would of her,`
- `We gave her in marriage to you`
- `so that there should not be any constraint for the believers regarding the wives of their adopted sons after they had accomplished whatever they would of them.`
- `And Allah's command was bound to be accomplished.`

## Ayat 38

- `There could be no hindrance to the Prophet regarding what Allah ordained for him.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - These words show that for the other Muslims such a marriage is just permissible but for the Prophet (peace be upon him) it was a duty which Allah had imposed on him.
- `Such has been Allah's Way (with the Prophets) who went before.`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - That is, for the Prophets it has always been a law that whatever command they receive from Allah, they have to act on it as a duty which they cannot in any case avoid. When Allah enjoins something on His Prophet (peace be upon him), he has to accomplish it even if the entire world is deadly opposed to it.
- `Allah's command is a decree firmly determined.`

## Ayat 39

- `(This is Allah's Way) regarding those who deliver the Messages of Allah and who fear Him, and fear no one else than Allah.`
- **`Allah is Sufficient as a Reckoner.`**

## Ayat 40

- `Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the seal of the Prophets.`
- **`Allah has full knowledge of everything.`**

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This one sentence was at the root of all those objections which the opponents were raising in connection with this marriage of the Prophet (peace be upon him).
