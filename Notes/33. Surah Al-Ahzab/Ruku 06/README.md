**Ayat 41 - 52**

## Ayat 41

- `Believers, remember Allah much`

## Ayat 42

- `and glorify Him morning and evening.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is meant to instruct the Muslims to the effect: When the Messenger (peace be upon him) of Allah is being showered with taunts and abuses by the enemies and his person being made the target of a propaganda campaign to frustrate his mission, the believers should neither listen to these absurd things unconcerned, nor should become themselves also involved in the doubts and suspicions spread by the enemies, nor should resort to abusive language in retaliation, but they should turn to Allah and remember Him more than usual as a special measure. The meaning of remembering Allah much has been explained in (E.N. 63) above. “Glorify Him morning and evening” means to glorify Allah constantly, to express His holiness and purity by word of mouth and not merely by counting beads on the rosary.


## Ayat 43

- `It is He Who lavishes His blessings on you`
- `and His angels invoke blessings on you that He may lead you out of darkness into light.`
- `He is Most Compassionate to the believers.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This is meant to make the Muslims realize this: The jealousy and malice of the disbelievers and hypocrites towards you is only due to the mercy that Allah has shown you through His Messenger (peace be upon him). It is through him that you have been blessed with the faith, that you have come out from the darkness of unbelief and ignorance into the light of Islam, that you have developed the high moral and social qualities by virtue of which you stand distinguished above others.
  - It is this which has filled the jealous people with malice and rage against the Messenger (peace be upon him) of Allah. However, in this state you should not adopt any unbecoming attitude which might alienate you from the mercy of Allah.

## Ayat 44

- `On the Day they meet Him they will be greeted with:`
  - **`“Peace.”`**
- `He has prepared for them a generous reward.`

## Ayat 45

- `O Prophet,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - After admonishing the Muslims, Allah now addresses a few words of consolation to His Prophet (peace be upon him), as if to say: “We have blessed you with such and such a high rank and raised you to an exalted place of honor. Your opponents will not be able to harm you in any way by their propaganda campaign of slander and calumny. Therefore, you should not take their mischief to heart, nor give any weight to their propaganda. You should continue doing the duties of your mission, and let them utter whatever nonsense they like.” Along with this, incidentally, the other people, both the believers and the unbelievers, also have been told that the person they have to deal with is not an ordinary man but a great personality, whom Allah has raised to the highest ranks of honor and glory.
- `We have sent you forth as a witness,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - The meaning of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) being a “witness” is very vast. It includes three kinds of evidence:
      - (1) Verbal evidence, i.e. the Prophet (peace be upon him) should bear out the truth of the realities and principles on which Allah’s religion is based and tell the world plainly that they are the truth and all that is opposed to them is falsehood. He should rise to proclaim without hesitation and fear the Being of Allah and His Unity, the existence of the angels, the coming down of revelation, the occurrence of life-after-death, the Hell and Heaven, all are realities, even if they appear strange to the world, and the people mock the one presenting them, or call him a madman. Likewise, the Prophet (peace be upon him) should openly present before the people the concepts, values, principles and rules pertaining to morality and civilization and social life that God has revealed to him, and reject as wrong all the concepts and ways which are prevalent and are opposed to them, even if the whole world rejects them as wrong and violates them in practice. Similarly, the Prophet (peace be upon him) should proclaim as lawful what is lawful in Allah’s law even if the whole world regards it as unlawful, and should proclaim as unlawful whatever is unlawful in Allah’s law even if the world regards it as lawful and pure.
- `a bearer of good tidings, and a warner,`

## Ayat 46

- `as one who calls people to Allah by His leave, and as a bright, shining lamp.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here also the same difference as pointed out above exists between the preaching of a common man and of a Prophet.
  - As for the invitation to Allah, it is given, and can be given, by every preacher, but he is not appointed by Allah to do so. Contrary to this, a Prophet rises to call the people towards Allah by the leave of Allah. His call is not mere preaching but has also the support of the authority of the Lord of the universe, Who sent him.
  - That is why resistance and opposition to the inviter to Allah amounts to rebellion against Allah Himself precisely as resistance to a government official when he is performing official duty is regarded as hostile to the government itself.

## Ayat 47

- `Announce to the believers the good tidings that Allah has kept bounteous blessings in store for them.`

## Ayat 48

- `Do not yield to the unbelievers and the hypocrites,`
- **`and disregard the hurt that comes from them,`**
- **`and put your trust in Allah.`**
- **`Allah suffices as the Guardian to entrust one's affairs to.`**

## Ayat 49

- `Believers,`
- `when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them,`
  - Tahfim-ul-Quran:
    - This sentence is explicit that the word nikah here has been used for the contract of marriage only.
    - The lexicographers have greatly disputed over the real meaning of the Arabic word nikah.
      - One group of them says that as a word it is common both for intercourse and for the contract of marriage.
      - The second group says that in its meaning it is common for both.
      - The third group opines that its real meaning is the contract of marriage and for intercourse it is used only figuratively.
      - And the fourth group expresses the opinion that its real meaning is intercourse and for the contract of marriage it is used only figuratively.
    - Each group has cited Arabic poetry in support of its view. But Raghib Isfahani has emphatically asserted this: “The real meaning of the word nikah is contract of marriage; it has been used for intercourse metaphorically. It is impossible that its real meaning be intercourse and may have been used for the contract of marriage only metaphorically.” The argument he gives is that all the words that have been actually coined for intercourse in Arabic, or in other languages of the world, are obscene and vulgar. No gentleman would like to utter them in a civilized gathering. Therefore, it is not possible that a society should use the word which has actually been coined for this act for marriage as a metaphor. For conveying this meaning only chaste words have been used in every language of the world and not obscene words.
- `you may not require them to observe a waiting period that you might reckon against them.`
- `So make provision for them and release them in an honourable manner.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - As far as the Quran and Sunnah arc concerned, nikah is a term, which either implies only contract of marriage, or intercourse after the contract of marriage; but it has nowhere been used for intercourse outside marriage. This kind of intercourse has been called zina (adultery) by the Quran and Sunnah and not nikah.


## Ayat 50

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This, in fact, is an answer to the objection of the people who said that Muhammad (peace be upon him) forbade others to keep more than four wives at a time but had himself taken a fifth wife. This objection was raised because at the time the Prophet (peace be upon him) married Zainab, he already had four wives with him:
    - (1) Saudah, whom he had married in the 3rd year before the Hijrah,
    - (2) Aishah, whom he married in the 3rd year before the Hijrah but who came to live with him in Shawwal, A.H. 1,
    - (3) Hafsah, whom he married in Shaban, A.H. 3, and,


- `O Prophet, We have made lawful for you`
- `your wives whose bridal dues you have paid, and`
- `the slave-girls you possess from among the prisoners of war, and`
- `the daughters of your paternal uncles and paternal aunts,`
- `and the daughters of your maternal uncles and maternal aunts who have migrated with you, and`
- `a believing woman who gives herself to the Prophet and whom he wants to take in marriage.`
- `(O Prophet), this privilege is yours alone to the exclusion of other believers.`
- `We know well what restrictions We have imposed upon them as regards their wives and those whom their right hands possess, (and have exempted you from those restrictions) that there may be no constraint upon you.`
- **`Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.`**

## Ayat 51

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - This verse was meant to relieve the Prophet (peace be upon him) of the domestic worries and anxieties so that he could carry out his duties with full peace of mind. When Allah clearly gave him the power and the authority to treat any of his wives as he liked, there remained no chance that those believing ladies would trouble him in any way, or would create complications for him by their mutual rivalries and domestic squabbles. But in spite of having this authority from Allah the Prophet (peace be upon him) meted out full justice to his wives. He did not prefer one to the other and would visit each of them regularly by turns. Only Abu Razin from among the traditionalists has said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) visited only four of his wives, Aishah, Hafsah, Zainab and Umm Salamah by turns and no turn had been fixed for the other wives. But all other traditionalists and commentators contradict this and prove by authentic traditions that even after having this authority the Prophet (peace be upon him) visited all his wives in turn and treated there alike. 
  - Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai, Abu Daud and others have reported on the authority of Aishah that even after the revelation of this verse the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) practice was that whenever he wanted to visit any of us, his wives, on the turn of another wife, he would first ask her permission for it. Abu Bakr al-Jassas relates from Urwah bin Zubair that Aishah told him, “As to our rants the Prophet (peace be upon him) never preferred any of us to the other, although it seldom happened that he did not visit all his wives on the same day, but he never touched a wife unless it was her day by turn.” And this also is a tradition from Aishah that during his last illness when it became difficult for him to move about he asked for his other wives’ permission to stay with her, and only on their approval he passed his last days in her apartment. Ibn Abi Hatim has cited this from Imam Zuhri that the Prophet (peace be upon him) is not known to have deprived any of his wives of her turn. To this only Saudah was an exception, who on account of her advanced age had willingly surrendered her turn in favor of Aishah.


- `Of them you may put off any of them you wish,`
- `and you may take any of them whom you wish,`
- `and you may call back any of those whom you had (temporarily) set aside:`
  - `there will be no blame on you (on this account).`
- `It is likelier that they will thus be comforted, and will not grieve, and every one of them will be well-pleased with what you give them.`
- `Allah knows what is in your hearts.`
- `Allah is All-Knowing, All-Forbearing.`

- Tahfim-ul-Quran:
  - Here, nobody should entertain the doubt that Allah had, God forbid, shown an undue privilege to His Prophet (peace be upon him) and deprived his wives of their rights. 
  - As a matter of fact, the great objectives for the sake of which the Prophet (peace be upon him) had been made an exception to the general rule in respect of the number of wives, also demanded that he should be afforded full peace in domestic life and anything that could cause him distraction and embarrassment should be eradicated.
  - It was a unique honor for the wives that they were privileged to be the life-partners of the greatest of all men like the Prophet (peace be upon him), and by virtue of this they got the opportunity to become his companions and helpers in the great task of reform and invitation that was to become the means of true success for mankind till the end of time.
  - Just as the Prophet (peace be upon him) was offering every kind of sacrifice for the sake of this objective and the companions were also following his example according to their capabilities, so it was also the duty of his wives to display selflessness in every way. Therefore, all the wives accepted Allah’s decision with regard to themselves happily and willingly.

## Ayat 52

- `Thereafter women will not be lawful for you, and it will not be lawful for you to take other wives in place of them,`
- `even though their beauty might please you,`
- `unless they be those whom your right hand owns.`
- `Allah is watchful over everything.`
